1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,590
You are listening to under the skin with
Russell brand.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,780
Today I'll be speaking to rupert 
sheldrake.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,643
Rupert sheldrake is a biologist who's 
been called the most controversial 

4
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:11,860
scientist on,
uh,

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,960
his research strongly challenges the 
paradigms of conventional science.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,170
And he's the author of multiple 
scientific papers and 10 science books,

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,670
many of which have been best sellers 
worldwide,

8
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,504
which developers hypotheses that 
traditional science has difficulty 

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,250
explaining,
such as he's popular theory,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
morphic resonance.
It lives in London with his wife,

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,360
Jill,
and they have two sons.

12
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,194
He's latest book science and spiritual 
practice is out now I'm holding a copy 

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,740
of it in my hands.
I'm looking at Rupert Sheldrake,

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,574
who's been,
we've been in the studio and matter of 

15
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,764
minutes,
you've challenged the setup of the 

16
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,670
studio many ways,
the positioning of the microphone,

17
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,504
the positioning of the camera.
It seems to me that you are a man who 

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,710
continually flies in the face of 
convention.

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,040
Have you always been like this rupert?
Um,

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,890
well not completely,
no,

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,880
but I have always heard her kind of 
contrarian streak,

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,230
I suppose.
How were your,

23
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,120
was your,
your early experience,

24
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,150
your early professional life was 
conventional academia?

25
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:12,661
It's that,
right?

26
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,494
You were like uh,
Oxford researcher or dawn dawn at 

27
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:16,944
Cambridge.
I did a phd at Cambridge knows that 

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,920
Donna.
Yes,

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,580
I and a sort of a,
I suppose a conventional biologist.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,073
Well I was doing unconventional sounds 
under the guise of a conventional 

31
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,450
academic appointment as a research 
fellow.

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,420
So um,
I was actually,

33
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,560
when I was at Cambridge I was trying to 
see how we could expand the frontiers of

34
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:40,020
biology go beyond the framework of 
thinking.

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,150
But at that stage I hadn't published 
clarity as on morphic resonance and what

36
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,680
I did was relatively within the limits 
of acceptable science.

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,070
It's interesting the Dogma and doctrine 
that it exists within the scientific and

38
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,634
academic communities and yours is an 
interview that I feel that at the front 

39
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,054
of obligated to say that your 
controversy is that I think that people 

40
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:08,991
like on the sort of I posing side of the
argument kind of regard you as like,

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,770
cause I'm interested,
very interested in spirituality.

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,603
I'm very interested in science.
But what you've already said about 

43
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:20,940
challenging frameworks is where my 
particular academic interest lies.

44
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,670
I know there's much about convention 
that I've have to learn.

45
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,504
Of course I do like most people,
but I'm very interested in pushing 

46
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,900
frontiers and boundaries.
But like there's some of the criticism,

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,501
oh yeah,
that's it.

48
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,334
Like,
but what you're accused of is like 

49
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,180
pseudo science and stuff that's not 
backed up by proper evidence.

50
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,970
And I feel like that if we had neil 
degrasse Tyson on,

51
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:42,540
and I hope we do one day or when I've 
had people I had on a sort of a,

52
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,730
uh,
the head of philosophy once from Oxford,

53
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,640
he was like a Christian theologian.
And it's interesting,

54
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,474
isn't it?
Because once you're dealing with 

55
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:49,644
mysticism,
which Christianity must be referred to 

56
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,910
as to a degree like that,
there's a kind of,

57
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:56,760
there's a hierarchy and there's hedge 
money within those fields.

58
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,594
Why are you controversial?
What is it the have said that makes 

59
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,190
people think

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
of you?
Is that a phrase that I particularly 

61
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,620
hated them sometimes if anybody,
Woo Woo Frou Frou band Ted talk.

62
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,600
You've got banned Ted talk,
that elite club,

63
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:12,340
which I think is somewhat admirable.
Tell me like what your detractors say of

64
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,480
you.
If you don't mind?

65
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,063
Well,
first I have to say why they think it's 

66
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,050
heretical.
Um,

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,353
what I'm doing fundamentally is 
challenging the materialist model of 

68
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:23,794
reality,
which sounds his based on has been for 

69
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,164
more than a hundred years,
which is the doctrine that all matters 

70
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,854
unconscious.
The whole universe is made of 

71
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,360
unconscious matter.
Um,

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,950
which then leaves the problem.
How come we are conscious?

73
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,173
And that's called the hard problem.
The most scientists assume that 

74
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,314
consciousness exists only in human 
brains and possibly in animal brains to 

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,331
um,
you know,

76
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,164
the liberal ones.
So maybe as far down as worms or 

77
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
something,
but,

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,771
um,
anyway,

79
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,400
it's all only in brains and the rest of 
the universities unconscious,

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,250
purposeless going nowhere.

81
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,070
Evolution is just a matter of blown 
churns.

82
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,350
There's no god out there.
There's no spirit heart there.

83
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,470
There's no creativity out there is dry.
It's just chance.

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,143
Um,
and that because they believe are 

85
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,720
mindset,
nothing but our brains,

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,033
then anything that suggests the mind 
extends further than the brain must be 

87
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,920
pseudo scientific.
So for example,

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,320
I've done a lot of research on 
telepathy,

89
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,900
um,
where people,

90
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,734
and indeed dogs.
I wrote a whole book on dog to and 

91
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,710
animal telepathy called dogs that know 
when their owners are coming home.

92
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,053
Um,
based on evidence that dogs can tell 

93
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,724
when their owners are coming home.
Millions of people have had this 

94
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,080
experience.
I've done experiments and sure enough,

95
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,463
at least some dogs really can know when 
people come at random times and 

96
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,791
unfamiliar vehicles we film at All.
We have all this objective evidence.

97
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,623
But the very,
the very fact that I'm suggesting to 

98
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,114
laugh with you might be real is 
something that provokes this kind of 

99
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,634
hysterical response that it must be we 
were pseudoscience because my opponents 

100
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,520
believe it's impossible.

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,070
So they don't think they need to look at
the evidence.

102
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:09,904
So you think it's impossible,
therefore this stuff must be fake or 

103
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,800
phony or fraudulent.
Um,

104
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,710
and what I do is start from the position
that these things seem to happen.

105
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,544
Millions of people with dogs have notice
their dogs or cats pick up their 

106
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,024
thoughts,
millions of people who've had the 

107
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,050
experience of thinking of some who then 
rings on the phone,

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
telephone,
telepathy.

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,660
And I've done experiments to show it's 
not just chance.

110
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:35,560
It's not just guessing.
Um,

111
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,900
so anyway,
these are the kinds of,

112
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,240
what do you think that let's say,
hey cause you know like listen to me,

113
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,074
I'm all about God and consciousness and 
changing the world and a model that 

114
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,373
expands beyond material is,
and this is where my particular 

115
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:52,030
fascination light,
but wouldn't they say that those,

116
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,650
firstly,
those examples about,

117
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,580
you know,
cats and dogs,

118
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,414
they seem sort of somehow hum drum and 
every day they seem anecdotal and w and 

119
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,214
wouldn't they say members of the 
mainstream scientific community know 

120
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,660
we've done tests around that.

121
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,530
It's down to random chance dogs don't 
know when their owners are coming home.

122
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,740
We've can demonstrate this in scientific
laboratory conditions,

123
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,040
double blind testing,
et cetera.

124
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,740
I wouldn't,
isn't that what they would say?

125
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,790
No,
no,

126
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,890
they don't see that.
Well first of all,

127
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,510
this,
it turned out total.

128
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,750
But what I searched there too as well.
If lots of people,

129
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,584
I hope more than a thousand AU database,
I've got more than a thousand studies 

130
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,393
your case.
Hundreds of dogs that do this and 600 

131
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,353
cats.
Well I would say the plural of anecdote 

132
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,664
is data.
If lots of people notice something then 

133
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,163
to say this is rubbish because lots of 
people say or they've noticed it isn't 

134
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,600
the right starting point for science.
It's meant to be empirical,

135
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,340
which means based on experience.
So my response to this is to say,

136
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,330
okay,
well let's test it.

137
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,270
Well it wasn't that they'd done the 
tests and shown it didn't happen.

138
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,810
No one had ever done a test before cause
they assume it's rubbish.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,920
So when I do the tests then with the 
dogs,

140
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,550
then you involves filming the dog,
the place,

141
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,384
the dog weights.
Having people come at random times come 

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,940
in unfamiliar vehicles.
So there's no possibility of the two.

143
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:12,774
It's a routine response.
They can't smell people from many miles 

144
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,754
away.
They can't identify the signed for 

145
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,970
unfamiliar taxi or other vehicle.
Um,

146
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,910
and these dogs still do it and it's all 
on film.

147
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,103
So I would say this is evidence for 
something which lots of people believe 

148
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,660
exist.
And the reason that,

149
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,583
um,
I'd concentrate a lot in a lot of my 

150
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,110
work on what I call the mysteries of 
everyday life,

151
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,690
what you call humdrum,
um,

152
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,763
is precisely because these phenomena are
classified by most scientists as 

153
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,470
paranormal or para means beyond.
They're saying that paranormal,

154
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,230
which means they're sort of spooky or we
were,

155
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,630
my point is they're not paranormal at 
all.

156
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,600
Their normal everyday experiences.
For most people.

157
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,750
What's paranormal is the claim that 
these things don't exist.

158
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,760
A claim made without evidence on purely 
ideological grounds near the beginning.

159
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,594
Ribbit you said that that basic model of
mainstream science is a materialistic 

160
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,160
one.
That material,

161
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,023
that Mata is not conscious and 
consciousnesses at some point in a way 

162
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,670
that we don't understand a merged from 
matter.

163
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,860
What do you think is the motivation for 
the defense of Dogma?

164
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,723
Why is it so,
why is rationalism and materialism so 

165
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:35,420
rigorously defended and alternative 
views?

166
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,390
Uh,
so vehemently opposed?

167
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,970
Well,
it's kind of political.

168
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,940
Originally it was political in the 19th 
century,

169
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,103
beginning of the 19th century,
materialism was quite a small minority 

170
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,580
view within biology.
A lot of people were fabulous.

171
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,800
They thought there was a life force or 
some life.

172
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,160
It wasn't just matter.
Organisms weren't just machines.

173
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,613
Um,
but the material is wanted to believe 

174
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,570
that because they wanted a universal 
that's just matter cause such a universe

175
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,860
would have no god in it.

176
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,383
Why did they want that?
Because particularly in France where 

177
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,950
atheism got going in a big way,
much more than an England,

178
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,983
the old regime that was overthrown in 
the French revolution was very closely 

179
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,140
allied with the church,
the Roman church.

180
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,040
And they thought that to get rid of the 
king,

181
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,140
you got to get rid of Cha,
the church too.

182
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,600
And the best way to get rid of the power
that the church was to say,

183
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,240
God doesn't exist.
So the whole thing's ridiculous.

184
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:41,241
Sharman pretends.
So in the French revolution in 1793 they

185
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,960
abolished the Catholic Church in France.
They closed the monasteries,

186
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,823
they guillotines tens of thousands of 
priests and they proclaimed the cult of 

187
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,444
reasons as the state religion notradame 
cathedral was turned into a template of 

188
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,434
reason.
Now in Russia where you had a similar 

189
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,290
massive growth of atheism in the late 
19th century.

190
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,910
The Bolsheviks in whose revolution 
account or missed a hundred years ago,

191
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,250
1917,
um,

192
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,493
wanted to get rid of religion because 
they thought religion supported the SAR 

193
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,850
and,
and the state,

194
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,030
and they wanted to destroy this 
religious underpinning.

195
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,800
So science was an ally for them in this 
militant atheism.

196
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,173
And in Russia in the 19th centuries,
they had about 5 million people belong 

197
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,660
to an organization called the League of 
the militant godless.

198
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,033
That went round a bit like terrifying,
terrifying bit like the League of the 

199
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,990
militant godless.

200
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,583
They went around and trying to stamp out
everything to do with religion in 

201
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,850
Russia,
a bit like the red cards in China.

202
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And so atheism was essentially political
in the 19th century.

203
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,494
And for much of the 20th century,
and many people who are atheists wanted 

204
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,530
materialist science to back up their 
views because it meant they could reject

205
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,320
organized religion,
particularly Christianity,

206
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,320
uh,
in favor of other ideologies.

207
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,243
So it was a necessary tool in 
challenging hatch mini that religion at 

208
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,874
the idea of God and man's relationship 
with God was tied up in power 

209
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:15,594
structures.
These power structures were corrupt and 

210
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,290
oppressive,
needed to be overthrown.

211
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,124
I mean no one's saying the French 
revolution or the Russian revolution 

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,320
where bad things necessary but 
unnecessary revolutions,

213
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,070
but in order to underwrite those 
revolutions,

214
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:29,904
you had to attack the idea of God,
which was the main stay of the hedge 

215
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,700
money or the sort of the basis of that 
power.

216
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,773
Now,
earlier you mentioned this idea within 

217
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,210
biology of vitalism,
there in a,

218
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,113
in a a hundred years ago in biology that
the idea that there was a sort of a 

219
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:48,870
super mechanical component and element 
that couldn't be tracked was present.

220
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,883
I'm learning much about vedic philosophy
where they talk about the idea of 

221
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,394
Brahman,

222
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,263
Prana,
Atma the idea that there are essential 

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,540
non-mechanical energies.
Now is this,

224
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,590
what is this connected to your idea of 
morphic resonance?

225
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,480
How does it relate to it?
When you talk about,

226
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,580
well,
what do you mean by morphic residence?

227
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,340
What do you mean by non mechanical 
energy?

228
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,440
Even though it wasn't,
you said that it was me.

229
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,620
Well,
morphic resonance is the idea.

230
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,440
This a kind of memory in nature.
You see contemporary science,

231
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,274
one of the dogmas which was established 
in the 17th century at the scientific 

232
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:29,390
revolution is the idea that nature is 
governed by fixed laws.

233
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,673
And the idea was in the 17th century,
God is the maker and ruler of the 

234
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,110
universe.
And God is eternal.

235
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,950
So God's laws are eternal.
And then,

236
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,843
um,
the idea was that everything in nature 

237
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,900
has to follow these laws because God is 
omnipotent.

238
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:48,260
So God was the universal law enforcement
agency.

239
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
That was the metaphor.
Yes.

240
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,530
Um,
so,

241
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,743
um,
it was a theological consumption and 

242
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,230
they didn't have the idea of evolution 
then.

243
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,843
And it's very anthropocentric metaphor.
The idea of the universe that nature is 

244
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,070
governed by laws and only humans have 
laws.

245
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,170
Yes.
So when you think about it,

246
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:08,690
it's not a very appropriate metaphor to 
start with.

247
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,300
No,

248
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,133
they were just patterns.
And I like this idea of metaphor and 

249
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:13,170
it's,
uh,

250
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,780
uh,
uh,

251
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,613
the fact that we are necessarily dealing
with metaphor when we're dealing with 

252
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,340
science.
Uh,

253
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,020
that it,
even the mechanistic model was contrived

254
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,973
at a time when industry and 
mechanization was happening in human 

255
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:31,734
culture.
So it would have been an attractive 

256
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:38,340
model and accessible model when 
mechanization was happening socially.

257
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,680
Oh,
humans are a bit like a machine.

258
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,040
Nature's a bit like a machine that was 
in the language.

259
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:44,874
It was in the ether here became 
inappropriate metaphor for 

260
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:47,760
understanding.
Is that correct?

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,980
It is,
yes.

262
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,113
So he sort of nature as a kind of 
mechanical system made off of 

263
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,570
unconscious matter based on forces at 
work,

264
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:59,780
by pushing and pulling at mechanical 
forces.

265
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,530
Um,
and the idea that the laws were fixed at

266
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,670
the beginning,
uh,

267
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,653
you see,
was it made sense when they thought the 

268
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,144
universe didn't basically change.
But when the idea of evolution came 

269
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:14,630
along first in biology with Darwin in 
1859,

270
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,400
but then with the Big Bang Siri in the 
whole of nature,

271
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,363
as late as 1966,
we got to radically evolutionary 

272
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,370
cosmology.
If everything's evolving,

273
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,563
then why not?
The laws of nature and in fact laws of 

274
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:30,801
nature.
As I said,

275
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,950
it isn't a very good metaphor.
Why Not Habits?

276
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,263
Why can't universe have regularities 
that are habits and then as it kind of 

277
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,283
memory in nature that sustains them 
instead of some kind of external 

278
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:48,011
transcendent mind with fixed laws in it,
which is the eternal eternal God idea.

279
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,763
I've nothing against God,
but I've got a lot of against the idea 

280
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,470
of God making laws of nature that are 
totally fixed.

281
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,893
Yes.
It's almost like the requirement for 

282
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:03,150
fixed laws is that a requirement in 
order to conduct study.

283
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,300
If there are no fixed laws,
it's impossible to conduct study,

284
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,300
so you need fixed laws.
There must be fixed laws,

285
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:12,900
but in a way it doesn't make sense.
If you're moving through limit the space

286
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:16,770
which is continually evolving,
it's more likely that there are patterns

287
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,633
that seem like laws when observed from a
particular perspective but are going to 

288
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:22,614
be subject to the continual evolution 
and change that all other phenomena 

289
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,230
appear to be subjective.

290
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,573
Absolutely.
It puts it very well and you'll see 

291
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,180
things that have been going on a very 
long time,

292
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,014
like the crystallization of salt or the 
formation of hydrogen atoms are such 

293
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,150
deep habits.
They behave as if they're changeless,

294
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,050
but when you look at new things,
new forms of learning,

295
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,720
new forms of behavior,
new chemical compounds,

296
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,883
then you see the habits build up and the
evidence for morphic resonance comes 

297
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:55,100
from looking at new phenomenon,
seeing new habits build up.

298
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,180
For example,
if you crystallize a new compound,

299
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,340
a new chemical compound for the first 
time,

300
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,490
it takes months or even years before 
crystals form.

301
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,490
But then once you've got it going all 
around the world,

302
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:10,970
they form more easily.
If you trained rats to learn a new trick

303
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,804
in London and rats all around the world 
learn the same thing quicker according 

304
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:19,100
to actual evidence,
this disputed evidence,

305
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,960
or is that stuff that's like,
we're down with that?

306
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,180
Well,
the evidence was done years ago,

307
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,880
Harvard and in Edinburgh and Melbourne 
university's,

308
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,680
no one's disputed.
The evidence,

309
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:30,320
the disputation is about how you 
interpret it.

310
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,190
And most people thought at the time,
well,

311
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,250
this just shows some weird effect that 
we don't fully understand,

312
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,260
so let's forget about it.
Um,

313
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,020
I think the evidence for morphic 
resonance,

314
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:45,200
you see a lot of phenomenal already 
there.

315
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,740
Um,
that people agree about fit with morphic

316
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,820
resonance.
For example,

317
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,570
Iq scores have gone up more than 30% 
since Iq tests were invented in 1918 and

318
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,400
I predicted this would happen myself,
not in 1918 obvious too,

319
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:03,680
but in the 1980s,
um,

320
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,070
because the tests have remained more or 
less the same,

321
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,950
millions of people have done them,
millions of people of salt,

322
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:10,784
these problems,
it should be getting easier to do the 

323
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:14,720
tests.
Those calls would be going up.

324
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,540
The average scores,
not because people are getting smarter,

325
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,000
there's no independent evidence.
They're getting smarter,

326
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,400
but the scores are going up because so 
many people have already done the tests.

327
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,313
I see is that there's a shared icloud of
consciousness that we're all uploading 

328
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:30,874
our results into,
that we will have access to access to 

329
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,933
that.
Consciousness is not wholly housed in 

330
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:36,214
the brain,
but consciousness has some other 

331
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:38,794
component.
That's one aspect of the theory of 

332
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:41,530
morphic resonance is it?

333
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,513
It is.
It's a kind of collective memory and 

334
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,880
that idea already existed in this 
psychologist young.

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,833
Yes,
with his Jerry was the collective 

336
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,380
unconscious,
um,

337
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,650
had the idea that we all tap into a kind
of collective memory,

338
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,053
but he was thinking just in terms of 
human psychology and I'm saying that's 

339
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:02,310
the way that all nature works.
It's not just us.

340
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,223
When you talk to this,
he saying because of patterns in dreams 

341
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,623
that people dream in a kind of 
consistent language in set and Casey's 

342
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:12,914
that motifs appear across cases,
across continents that have a continuum 

343
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,224
to them.
Joseph Campbell's working comparative 

344
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,564
mythology suggest that indigenous 
cultures produce patterns within their 

345
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:27,880
myths that are identifiable.
That the s,

346
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,100
uh,
an African myth or an Icelandic myth can

347
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:31,934
have templates that are comparable,
which suggest that consciousness 

348
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,850
communicates or at least has some 
essential quality.

349
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,570
There is not determined by material 
reality or geography,

350
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:44,210
but has some other form of connection.
I mean,

351
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,950
I personally don't have a problem with 
this idea because I see that the sensory

352
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:52,430
realm is accessible by the instruments 
we have.

353
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,264
If we didn't have a sense of smell,
I wouldn't be able to understand 

354
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,860
conceptually what you meant by a sense 
of smell.

355
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,160
I know that different animals have 
different ranges of hearing,

356
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,083
have different ranges of sites.
So it seems to me possible that energy 

357
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:05,714
can communicate and travel in means too 
subtle for my limited instruments to 

358
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,430
ascertain and receive.
So for me,

359
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:14,264
it's never been a problem.
But it is necessarily difficult to 

360
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,134
demonstrate when it's transferred back 
into the language of mechanics material 

361
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,620
and identifiable evidence,
isn't it?

362
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,021
Well,
I mean,

363
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,340
not in principle.
I mean,

364
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:30,760
you can do experiments to test this on 
chemicals,

365
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,680
on crystals,
on ranch,

366
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:36,460
on humans.
So in principle you can test us with the

367
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:37,630
scientific method.
I mean,

368
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,733
I'm totally pro the scientific method.
I spend a lot of my life doing 

369
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,700
experiments.
Um,

370
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,070
so,
um,

371
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,980
in principle there's no reason you can't
test it.

372
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,540
And in fact it has been tested.
Um,

373
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,100
it's just an unfamiliar idea for most 
Westerners.

374
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,090
Now you're studying eastern philosophy 
and eastern philosophy.

375
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:00,910
The idea of a memory in nature is 
completely standard.

376
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,930
Uh,
you know,

377
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,680
I lived in India for seven years.
I worked in an agricultural institute.

378
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,800
Um,
and the,

379
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,830
so I sort of got fairly familiar with 
Indian philosophy.

380
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,980
I was in much influenced by it.
I had this idea before I went,

381
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,623
but when I talked about this idea in 
Cambridge on high table of my college 

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,833
career,
college,

383
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,053
you know,
the looks of blanking comprehension or 

384
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,650
in the tea room of the Biochemistry 
Department where I worked,

385
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,730
um,
when I got to India I would explain this

386
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,890
idea to Indian friends and colleagues.

387
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,930
Even people I met on trains.
And you sound test.

388
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,390
They,
well they do.

389
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,030
They are,
they asked me first,

390
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:40,930
I didn't,
you know,

391
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:42,670
in India,
if you sit on the train,

392
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,680
uh,
what is your name?

393
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,563
Where are you from?
Ecentra and then give me some of your 

394
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:49,210
theories.
Yes,

395
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,890
about three questions in,
you know,

396
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,810
after,
what is your salary?

397
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,870
They ask you what is your view of the 
world?

398
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,893
So I really wants it.
So I explained this and the general 

399
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:04,750
response I got from Indian friends,
colleagues,

400
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,900
and even strangers with,
there is nothing new in this idea.

401
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,750
Ancient Rishis have said there's 
thousands of years ago.

402
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,910
What's the,
what's the,

403
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,250
how,
how is that vedic?

404
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,290
We understood the idea that there is 
this a memory in nature,

405
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,050
but it's basically part of the 
philosophy of Karma,

406
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,423
which in in it's limited form is about 
reincarnation carrying over memories 

407
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:26,380
from one life to another.

408
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,460
But in it's more general form,
um,

409
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,900
can be seen as a theory of cosmic 
memory.

410
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,620
And in some forms of Buddhist and Hindu 
philosophy,

411
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,783
they have this idea of a cosmic memory.
The Sea Asopus took this up with our 

412
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:44,830
idea of the akashic records,
which is a kind of cosmic memory bank.

413
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,980
Um,
so I didn't know all that.

414
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:50,290
When I thought of these ideas in 
Cambridge,

415
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,150
I came to them through thinking about 
biology and plants and you know,

416
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:55,984
it was coming.
How did you come to when I was working 

417
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,150
on plants,
how do plants grow?

418
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,760
Plant morphogenesis the development of 
form.

419
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,790
Um,
how does the leaf become a leaf?

420
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,280
How does a rose fly become a rose 
flower?

421
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,040
Why is an oak leaf different from an ash
leaf?

422
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,170
Um,
I worked hard.

423
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,123
I was working on the plant and hormone 
auxins supplant a hormone that makes 

424
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,540
cells grow and makes roots form and 
makes would cells form.

425
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,460
And I worked hard at how it was made and
how it was transported run the plant.

426
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,713
But the thing is it's transported round 
to all plants in the similar way and 

427
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:32,404
it's made in a similar way in all plants
and yet they have different shapes and 

428
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,334
so everyone was trying to sell.
You can explain form in terms of 

429
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,690
chemicals and this was the main 
chemical.

430
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,360
Everyone thought was the important 
influence,

431
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,360
but I realized actually it won't explain
it.

432
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,194
They've all got the same one is and it's
like trying to explain what goes on in 

433
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,124
different shops and factories and 
schools because they will have the same 

434
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,790
kind of money.
Are you an end to it?

435
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,910
It's,
it's the,

436
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:58,210
it's something that's part of the 
system.

437
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,190
Take it away in the system would 
collapse,

438
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,610
but it doesn't explain why they're 
different or why they have that form.

439
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,703
And an idea that came up in the 1920s in
developmental biology was the idea of 

440
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:13,870
morphogenetic fields,
fields that shape form.

441
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,970
I got interested in this,
but then I realized these fields have to

442
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:19,804
be inherited somehow.
They can't be inherited through genes 

443
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:26,620
were changing code for proteins.
They had to be inherited by some kind of

444
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,630
direct link.
And then I run out,

445
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
asked if it was a kind of memory across 
time,

446
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,430
a great deal of biology would make 
sense.

447
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,353
Not just biology but a lot of nature.
So I had this kind of flash of insight 

448
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,234
and for three or four days I was kind of
manic state when I first came up with 

449
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:46,760
the idea of morphic resonance because 
more and more things made sense.

450
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,330
And then I got worried,
you know,

451
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:50,790
it's a kind of theory of everything and 
you know,

452
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,920
I ought to be worried about there.
So I didn't publish it for another eight

453
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,080
years.
I thought I've really got to think about

454
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:02,081
this hard and look at the evidence.
And when I finally worked through a long

455
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,440
process,
it made,

456
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,470
it really did make sense after thinking 
it through.

457
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,510
And that's when I published my first 
book,

458
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,800
a new science of life.

459
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,733
The idea being that there is a memory 
that is beyond material that is 

460
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:18,450
traveling through time.
Can you give us some examples of that?

461
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,430
Well,
the one example would be the,

462
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:22,264
the thing I mentioned with rats.
If animals learn a new trick then ranch 

463
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,424
similar rats faced with the same trick 
somewhere else on the basis of 

464
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:31,624
similarity resonate with those rats 
before morphic resonance is about 

465
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,770
similarity in patterns of vibration or 
patterns of activity.

466
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,700
Um,
so um,

467
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,500
what I'm suggesting is there's a kind of
resonance across time that um,

468
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,403
just go,
Ma goes across time without falling off 

469
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:55,021
with time and across space.
I mean this is a difficult idea perhaps,

470
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:56,884
but the alternative is laws of nature 
that are outside of time and space 

471
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,860
altogether and yet somehow present 
everywhere.

472
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:07,540
It's not as if the conventional 
alternative is absolutely mind boggling.

473
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,460
My mind bottle factor free,
it's just we're used to it.

474
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,630
That's right.
You're quite right that to suggest there

475
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:13,464
are objective laws that exist outside of
time that is an unusual and as you've 

476
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,990
said already,
it's a,

477
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,680
it's analogist to the idea of God 
anyway.

478
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,260
Yeah.
That there is an absolute template,

479
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,060
a sovereign,
uh,

480
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,080
a sort of a monolith of truth that 
stands beyond the,

481
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,470
that's in a sense as a paradigm that is 
the same as saying,

482
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:36,930
God,
there's these rules that are in charge

483
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,903
except for material is scientists.
The rules are supposed to have come 

484
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,054
about spontaneously by themselves.
They're like things in a mind but they 

485
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:46,154
say there is no mind.
So they're completely paradoxical to 

486
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:51,740
have laws that are in material,
that are rational,

487
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,873
that have no material being and yet no 
non material substrate is incoherent 

488
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:00,974
belief.
And yet that's what most scientists 

489
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:02,770
believe.

490
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,603
How and why it is,
I mean what more of obvious example I 

491
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,014
for obvious that you know,
that famous example of the four minute 

492
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,384
mile as in the film,
chariots of fire though no one could 

493
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:15,190
break the four minute mile,
someone breaks the four minute mile,

494
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,083
then people break the four minute mile.
It's took a very poor public 

495
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:18,844
identifiable idea.
The once he's identified that something 

496
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:23,320
is achievable,
it becomes achievable.

497
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:25,360
It comes sanctioned,
accessible.

498
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:28,630
Somehow.
What I'm interested in rupert,

499
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,733
ease,
how dogma behaves and how heresy is 

500
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:37,120
regarded in control.
Now one of the things I enjoyed in your,

501
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,840
let's call it,
um,

502
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,850
uh,
like I,

503
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,280
I like to have a band,
a Ted talk is a cool thing.

504
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,220
I think like in your band

505
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,350
a Ted talk is,
uh,

506
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,440
when you were talking about how 
mainstream science protects it,

507
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,910
uh,
dogmas through denial of variation.

508
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:58,370
For example,
what's the,

509
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,090
uh,
the speed of light?

510
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,290
Yeah.
Well,

511
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,650
I gave an example of the speed of light 
that between,

512
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,120
I got interested in this because the 
idea that the speed of light,

513
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,954
it's totally constant and all the 
constants are constant as part of the 

514
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,720
fixed law dogma.
Um,

515
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,560
so I thought,
well,

516
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,890
I'll just check out.
I had no particular,

517
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:20,724
I don't work on physical constants.
So I wasn't a particular thing where I 

518
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:27,270
had a personal interest,
but I just thought I'd look at the data.

519
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,104
And when I did,
I was amazed to find it varied quite a 

520
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,374
lot between 1928 in 1950 or so,
the speed of light dropped by 20 

521
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:38,160
kilometers per second or around the 
world.

522
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,870
And then it went up again and they were 
all claiming that they're accurate.

523
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,000
They have little error bars on the 
graph.

524
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:50,001
So you showing very small arrows that 
the Arrow was like plus or minus 0.1

525
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:54,090
of a kilometer per second and yet lose 
20 kilometers per second difference.

526
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,590
And I just couldn't understand what was 
going on.

527
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:59,424
So I went to see the head of the 
national physics laboratory at 

528
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,240
Teddington,
um,

529
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,820
the man in charge of measuring 
constance.

530
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,060
And I asked him and he said,
well,

531
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,040
it was constant.
Don't even need him,

532
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,130
your laptop mate.
It's always the same.

533
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,950
So he said,
don't,

534
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,850
well,
um,

535
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,350
he said,
I know it's a very embarrassing incident

536
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,020
in the history of our science.
And I said,

537
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,970
well,
does that mean that everyone was fudging

538
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,520
their results?
So in,

539
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:32,354
in,
in,

540
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,263
during the whole of that period or 
around the world to get the expected 

541
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,750
result.
He said,

542
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,820
we don't like to use the word fudging.
He said,

543
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,241
I said,
well,

544
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:40,650
what do you call it?
And he said,

545
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,380
we prefer to call it intellectual phase,
locking certainly rate.

546
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,353
They then,
then it went up again and then they to 

547
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
resolve this problem.
They're just defined it.

548
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,410
They by fear,
they invented the speed of light,

549
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,350
the closest value.
And they said,

550
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,150
that's it from now on,
it's defined.

551
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,450
And then they defined the meter in terms
of the speed of light.

552
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,723
Um,
so that even if the speed of light did 

553
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,554
change,
you'd never notice because the media 

554
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,780
would change in length.

555
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,620
The same time in the unit of measurement
would also alter,

556
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,180
I'm reminded of the Melville quote,
all human science,

557
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,014
but passing fables as we learn more,
everything that we think of as being 

558
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,043
absolute will necessarily evolve because
we are only looking at a small portion 

559
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,080
of all of the available evidence.
What do,

560
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,973
uh,
revelations in quantum physics in your 

561
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,720
opinion,
mean about the nature of consciousness?

562
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,450
I know that they're double slit theory 
is an area that,

563
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,463
uh,
people like myself who are of a 

564
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,180
spiritual bent,
uh,

565
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,680
Lee Paul over as evidence that 
consciousness impact,

566
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,613
uh,
mattel matter and the behavior of waves 

567
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:55,810
and particles and physicists say,
no,

568
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:56,111
no,
no,

569
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,830
you're misinterpreting this in your 
drawing conclusions that are erroneous,

570
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,900
but what does it tell us without us 
being too sort of quick to leap on our,

571
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,711
um,
you know,

572
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:06,544
our chariots of fire and start blasting 
out the silver trump pits and 

573
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,030
proclaiming the lord?

574
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,610
Well,
I think the main,

575
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,473
most important thing about quantum 
theory is it tells us that nature is 

576
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:18,860
probabilistic,
but there's,

577
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,840
there's no rigid determinism.
You can't predict things exactly.

578
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,530
Um,
and there's a kind of inherent freedom,

579
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,443
right?
Even at the most fundamental put in the 

580
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:34,600
most fundamental particles of matter,
I think the staff freedom.

581
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,643
Yes.
Do you mean that just because the 

582
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:38,914
behavior of particles and waves 
apparently altering under observational 

583
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,320
and under observation?
No,

584
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,180
the the,
if,

585
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:48,970
if you measure the take a single photon 
going through a double slit for example,

586
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,073
you can't predict which way.
Whereas lend up which bit of the film 

587
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,330
that you're filming it with it'll land 
on.

588
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,910
But if you send thousands of single 
photons,

589
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,850
one after another,
you get a kind of average pattern,

590
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:04,480
which is like a wave pattern.
Um,

591
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,900
so it follows a kind of probability 
distribution,

592
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:10,000
but you can't predict any individual 
one.

593
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,640
If you've got a radioactive uranium 
atom,

594
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,310
you can't,
you can say what it's halflife is.

595
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,153
We've got millions of them by how many 
years will it be before half of them 

596
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,850
have decayed.
But this individual atom,

597
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:25,210
you can't tell if it's going to decay in
a million years or in the next second.

598
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,030
There's nothing that enables you to say 
that.

599
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,040
So there's an inherent freedom at the 
very foundation of matter.

600
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,383
And what chaos theory has shown is that 
even bigger things like the weather 

601
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,430
systems have a kind of inherent in 
determinism or freedom.

602
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,300
And the same is true of the way the 
nerve cells in our brain work.

603
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:48,910
And many of them are on a knife edge.
They could go one way or another.

604
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,330
So all through natures as this kind of 
in determinism.

605
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,873
Um,
that means there's a kind of inherent 

606
00:31:55,271 --> 00:32:00,190
freedom at all levels in nature.
There's certain strong habits,

607
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,820
but when you get things that are 
changing and they're on cusp points,

608
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,130
there's,
there's this kind of in determinism.

609
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,880
Now I don't think the observer stuff in 
quantum theory,

610
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,230
I think it's overrated.
The,

611
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,670
you know,
the consciousness thing.

612
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,133
Well basically what it says is that the 
kind of observation you make in quantum 

613
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,430
theory depends.
It depends on what you're observing.

614
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,473
In other words,
your observations depends on the 

615
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:27,970
Observer.
But the philosopher Schopenhauer pointed

616
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:32,020
out exactly that in around 1800 you need
the whole of science.

617
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,170
He said all observations depend on 
observers.

618
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,840
It,
it's not as if nature is out there,

619
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,990
just sort of passively observing itself.
When we observe nature,

620
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,930
we come to it with our frameworks of 
thought,

621
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,570
preconceptions,
measuring apparatus at Centra.

622
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
Whenever we ask a question of nature and
an experiment,

623
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,230
the answer we get depends on the 
question we make.

624
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,440
So that's a perfectly general point 
about all science.

625
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,220
It only came to sort of pump pillar 
consciousness through quantum theory,

626
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,100
but it's not specific to quantum theory.

627
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,910
Yes,
I see.

628
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,040
Now what do you think on a more 
practical level,

629
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,360
the imposition of dogma normally 
protects the interests of the powerful.

630
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,373
Is it important that much of what is 
regarded as a sanctioned and valorized 

631
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,960
science is corporately funded?

632
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,660
Is that important?
I don't think that's important.

633
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:26,120
Actually.
Not the most important thing sake.

634
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,373
The dog moves of science got established
before corporate funding became very 

635
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,604
important.
I mean this dogmatic materialism was 

636
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:36,920
already well established by the late 
19th century when,

637
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,800
you know there are a few German 
companies making aniline dyes and things

638
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,083
about them,
early chemical companies making aspirin 

639
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:45,344
and stuff.
But long before this sort of massive 

640
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:50,540
corporate involvement,
it was an ideological movement.

641
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,740
People like th Huxley here in England,
um,

642
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,443
we're basic material and that they 
wanted to spread the message about 

643
00:33:58,611 --> 00:33:59,444
materialism cause they wanted to destroy
the power of religion and make 

644
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:05,000
scientists as it were,
the new priesthood.

645
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,463
If you have a culture where you destroy 
the old priesthood and where science 

646
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:14,210
reasoning and progress of your ideology 
and every government now being converted

647
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,044
to it,
economic progress through science and 

648
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,880
technology,
every government in the world,

649
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:24,680
it's a dominant paradigm then who are 
the priests of this new culture?

650
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,873
Obviously as a scientist.
And Th Huxley wanted the scientist to 

651
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,310
become a kind of priestly caste,
um,

652
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,520
professional scientists who would then 
be the go to people for governments.

653
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,820
And in many countries there's a 
separation between church and state.

654
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,510
But in no country is the separation 
between science and state.

655
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,770
So I would say the power base of science
is much more state than,

656
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,080
than corporations.
They've come long later.

657
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,280
What is their gospel?
Well,

658
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,123
the Gospel is,
is we'll save the world through science 

659
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,580
and technology.
You know,

660
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,470
where the saviors of humanity,
um,

661
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,520
religions have screwed it up.
People just fight each other.

662
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,610
But we come along and we'll care.
Diseases,

663
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,870
reduce infant mortality,
provide abundant consumer goods,

664
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,210
uh,
prolong life.

665
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,730
And many of these promises of come true 
after all.

666
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,820
It's not just ideology.
It's a very powerful,

667
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,600
much less what is not empirical.
Well,

668
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:24,434
it's not imperia clears the metaphysical
belief system that nature's totally 

669
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,440
mechanical,
that it's all unconscious,

670
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,910
that the laws are fixed.

671
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,100
All these,
in my book,

672
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,470
the science to illusion,
I have these 10 dog,

673
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:38,280
most of science memories,
a stored in the brain.

674
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:39,820
That's another one.
Um,

675
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,690
they believe that because the 
materialist,

676
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,553
everything must be matter.
So all our memories must be inside our 

677
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,860
heads in some way.
A memory must have a material component.

678
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,610
It must on some level be measurable.
Exactly.

679
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,330
And therefore when you die and your 
brain decays,

680
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,313
all your memories were wiped out.
So every religion that believes in 

681
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,710
reincarnation or an afterlife or 
purgatory or whatever,

682
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,710
any form of transmigration,
any form of transmigration,

683
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:12,711
any kind of access to connections or 
anything like that must be rubbish.

684
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:13,914
Because memories in the brain is 
impossible for any aspect of them to 

685
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:17,754
survive.
It seems to me the rational conclusion 

686
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,260
of rationalism is that we are 
individuals.

687
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,400
There is no meaning,
therefore consume.

688
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,103
Yes.
And that's why the word materialism has 

689
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:30,900
two meanings.

690
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,860
And in science and philosophy,
it means this worldview I'd been talking

691
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:38,370
about and we've been discussing in 
ordinary everyday language.

692
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:39,204
It means people who go to shopping malls
all the time and are constantly 

693
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:42,354
consuming things.
That connection is telling that and you 

694
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:44,821
think,
oh,

695
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:45,654
I think so.
Yes,

696
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,910
very much so.
I think that it's not a coincidence.

697
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:52,020
We used the same word for both.
Can we talk a bit about psychedelics and

698
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,120
uh,
you taking psychedelics?

699
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,890
I don't want to talk too much about it 
since most of them are still illegal,

700
00:36:58,891 --> 00:36:59,724
but should we talk about how you've 
never taken psychedelics now it's 

701
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,680
illegal and wrong today.
I'll tell you why.

702
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,514
I'm very interested in Terence Mckenna 
and you were friends with Terence 

703
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,541
Mckenna when you,
in fact,

704
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,150
I've heard him talk about you and you 
and stuff.

705
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,870
We were great friends and in fact we had
with our friend Ralph Abraham,

706
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:22,080
who's a chaos theory mathematician at 
the University of California.

707
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,513
We had about 40 or 53 way trial logs and
we produced two books together and it 

708
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:33,090
was about 20 or 30 of these try logs are
on my website in streaming audio.

709
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,140
So,
you know,

710
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,003
for 20 years nearly we met every year.
We spent several days just talking to 

711
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:42,060
each other cause that's what we most 
enjoy doing.

712
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:42,894
And um,
one of the things we were interested in 

713
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:49,260
was indeed psychedelics.
And one is terrance had many interests.

714
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,360
Psychedelics is what he's best known 
for.

715
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,194
But he had an extraordinarily wide 
ranging mind and he was also incredibly 

716
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:57,240
funny.
Um,

717
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,680
well for me,
um,

718
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,713
just to,
I suppose if it's a long time ago and 

719
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:03,714
talked about it,
for me a great revelation was in about 

720
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:11,061
1971 when I took lsd for the first time 
and everything.

721
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,780
I had been taught about the nature of 
minds.

722
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,050
You know,
I studied this stuff.

723
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,390
It Cambridge as an undergraduate,
you know,

724
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,600
nerve impulses,
neurotransmitters,

725
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,260
hormones affecting sanctuary,
sexual characteristics,

726
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,094
all that kind of thing.
Suddenly and the immediacy and the 

727
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,170
incredible power of this visionary 
experience.

728
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,993
I just felt something very,
very important to just be left out from 

729
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:36,454
this world view.
So for me it really was what the term 

730
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,290
means,
psychedelic means psyche,

731
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,790
revealing mind,
revealing.

732
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:47,791
It revealed a Roho realms of mine that I
had no experience before noon at told me

733
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,970
about.
Um,

734
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,210
and opened up an interest in the nature 
of consciousness.

735
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:57,730
So for me,
it was a transformative experience.

736
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,593
Do you experienced during this period,
long time ago that was so 

737
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:03,910
transformative?
Describe it please.

738
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,170
Well,
the first thing that happened was I took

739
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,690
it with a French annotating it once or 
twice before.

740
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,210
We thought it took an hour to come on.
That's what he thought.

741
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,060
So we took it

742
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,200
to wrap the site that we can hear police
sirens.

743
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:19,883
So we took it,
we thought we'd have a meal while we 

744
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,373
came on.
So we were in a restaurant and it came 

745
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,930
on during the,
in this restaurant,

746
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:27,390
food started looking distorted,
the whole theme.

747
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,060
Okay.
So I want you to get back to my rooms in

748
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:30,894
college.
I was a of cloud college at the time 

749
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,580
too,
that suddenly this journey became a kind

750
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,900
of,
it went on forever,

751
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,900
going through streets and everything 
distorted.

752
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:40,734
And when I got back,
I thought I must have taken a massive 

753
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:44,220
area of days.
And I thought,

754
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,780
cause I felt completely out of control.
My whole ego was dissolved.

755
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:53,010
I didn't know what was happening.
It had come on sooner than we thought.

756
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,870
So I thought this must be a huge 
overdose.

757
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:56,840
I'll be insane forever,
etc.

758
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,100
In fact,
I thought I must be in hell.

759
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,370
And then neon signs saying hell that 
I've all around me,

760
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:03,210
which proved it.

761
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,340
Um,
then a friend,

762
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,383
um,
my friend sort of talk to me and I sort 

763
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:11,070
of came to my senses as it were,
and he's not really a census,

764
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:16,071
but suddenly I felt so if I was floating
up towards,

765
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,770
I saw the light above me and I broke 
through like the surface of the ocean.

766
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:22,260
And suddenly I was in the realm of 
transcendent beauty.

767
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,520
Um,
music turned into forms and patterns.

768
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,930
I had the sense of connection with the 
one at all and everything.

769
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:31,950
And,
um,

770
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,113
kind of mystical experience.
And I later came to know that Stan grof 

771
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:37,914
and other people describe this as a kind
of death and rebirth experience like 

772
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,280
that going up through the darkness to 
the light.

773
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,114
It's like being born from the wound,
coming out through the birth canal into 

774
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:49,524
the lighters,
kind of like a birth or rebirth 

775
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:52,854
experience.
So for me it was a kind of 

776
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,404
transformative moment of a whole new way
of understanding consciousness and my 

777
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,120
connection with the greater 
consciousness.

778
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,163
Yes,
the very idea that one's conscious 

779
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:10,080
experience can be chemically altered.
That one's perceptions are not um,

780
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,610
rigid.
For me.

781
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,973
It demonstrates the plasticity of 
reality and our relationship with 

782
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,920
reality.
Terence Mckenna,

783
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,803
one of the things that fascinates me 
about Kim is the conclusions he draws 

784
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:30,100
from these experiences with regards to 
the way that power operates,

785
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:34,130
the control of substances of this nature
in me as a person that's in from drugs.

786
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:35,090
You know,
I don't take drugs.

787
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm not taking drugs for a long time,
but what I,

788
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,823
what I personally in chew it is that 
there real so many vested interests in 

789
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:46,394
keeping people behaving in an orderly 
manner and if you have access to 

790
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,334
mysticism,
it one tends towards challenging 

791
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,760
structures and like we said at the 
beginning of our interview,

792
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:02,900
Rupert looking at frameworks and asking 
simply why,

793
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,050
why does my life have to exist within 
this framework?

794
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,340
Why must I behave in this way?
Why is this convention being observed?

795
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,080
I think it's interesting.

796
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,913
I know when you,
what you said about revolutions earlier 

797
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:15,344
and the necessity for to challenge the 
idea of God because of the way that God 

798
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:19,964
was operating in power structures prior 
to the two revolutions that you 

799
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,070
mentioned you use to underwrite those 
power structures.

800
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,120
I can see the necessity for challenging 
hedge money in that form,

801
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,720
but the removal of God to give you a 
professor the full niche and quote you,

802
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,263
the God is dead and we have killed him 
and there's not enough water in the 

803
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,930
world to watch the blood from our hands.
The idea that when we lose God,

804
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:45,890
when we lose a way of accessing and 
understanding the mystery,

805
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,173
we prevent ourselves.
We have prohibited from being fully 

806
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,930
human,
continually evolving and connected.

807
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:54,764
We begin to regard ourselves in the 
material model as components that have 

808
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:01,130
to have a mechanical function to be 
valuable.

809
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,280
We become a tool of consumerism.
We become either an asset or a deficit.

810
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,653
We don't have inherent value.
So I can see the politically why these 

811
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:16,370
power structures are perpetuating.
And even if,

812
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:19,820
as you say,
they existed prior to corporatization,

813
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,803
I would say the power behind 
corporatization is mutated and was 

814
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,600
present in some other form prior to 
that.

815
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,050
And that it's about the preservation of 
power structures and always has been.

816
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,690
And that's why it's so vehemently 
opposed.

817
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,160
Whenever anyone says,
Hey,

818
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,820
there's another world there.
Love is real.

819
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,330
We're all connected.
Yeah.

820
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,760
Whenever that message starts to come 
out,

821
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,790
people don't like it.
It gets dampened down pretty quick.

822
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,321
Right.
I agree.

823
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,154
And I think that the suppression of the,
there's a reason why these revolutions 

824
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:51,230
occurred.
And,

825
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,670
um,
but what,

826
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,653
what it leaves at the materialist 
worldview where from which God's been 

827
00:43:56,511 --> 00:44:01,250
removed or relentlessly St Kilda society
leaves people alone,

828
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,620
isolated and the privacy of their 
skulls.

829
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,260
And um,
and is it's a well,

830
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,133
it's meaningless and depressing and 
that's why depression is the endemic 

831
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,503
disease of modern societies.
But that's exactly why I think that in 

832
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,633
the secular age,
when many people have lost contact with 

833
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:23,960
traditional religions and spiritual 
practices are so important.

834
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,753
And that's why I my most recent books 
called science and spiritual practices 

835
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:30,810
because,
um,

836
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,133
the,
the paradoxical thing is the sort of 

837
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:35,934
ironic that people think of science as 
against spirituality when if you 

838
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:43,560
actually use science correctly and use 
look in an open minded way,

839
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,350
you studied spiritual practices 
scientifically,

840
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,513
like meditation for example,
then it turns out the evidence is 

841
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,404
overwhelming.

842
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,200
This is very good for people.
People who do it are happier,

843
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,150
healthier,
live longer.

844
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,440
Um,
you know,

845
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:02,100
people have figured out which bits of 
the brain changed during meditation,

846
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,700
lowering stress levels sleep better.
Um,

847
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
the scientific evidence suggests these 
are very,

848
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,930
these practices are very good for you.
In my book,

849
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:14,600
how I deal with a number of other ones,
like um,

850
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,803
connecting with nature,
which is very important practice for a 

851
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:21,480
lot of people,
including me and pilgrimage.

852
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,530
There's an amazing revival of pilgrimage
going on in Europe at the moment.

853
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:26,364
And um,
I think this is probably the one that 

854
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,680
most clearly expresses.
Um,

855
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,620
the fact that so many people feel 
they're on a journey,

856
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:35,454
they want to go somewhere there 
somewhere that connects them with 

857
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,484
something bigger than themselves.
It's the physical journey of a 

858
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,080
pilgrimages and expression of that such,
um,

859
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,320
for teleology,
yes,

860
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:48,250
there's a purpose to the,
the,

861
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,520
the,
the journey and the,

862
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,800
if you're getting an a pilgrimage to the
holy place,

863
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:57,100
then you're going to a place which holy 
and healing come from the same root.

864
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,210
So you're going to a place that can have
a healing effect on you.

865
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,340
You think then that

866
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:04,683
we live our lives extracted from these 
kinds of principles until they are 

867
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:12,100
somehow scientifically verified that w w
what you said about meditation,

868
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,400
it's something that I've thought about 
quite a lot that you know,

869
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:15,423
mindfulness and meditation and now 
spoken or from a perspective of 

870
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,550
wellbeing,
but it has been necessarily secularized.

871
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,653
Uh,
it's something that I find it kind of 

872
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:27,760
irritating I suppose because meditation 
is,

873
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,643
it was being present and suggested and 
proposed through religious ideologies 

874
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:36,220
for Millennia.
And was it,

875
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:37,054
and these conclusions were reached not 
by impure at wouldn't work perhaps by 

876
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,100
empirical means,
but we're not by scientific means.

877
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:48,150
I wonder what other notions found in 
theology would be similarly beneficial.

878
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,203
I don't query the need for change as in 
the examples that you've already given 

879
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:02,281
the revolutionary changes.
And nor do I dispute at how religion has

880
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,030
been used to support power to,
uh,

881
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,811
to,
to,

882
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:10,570
uh,
engine bigotry and oppression.

883
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,523
Those are like,
but,

884
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,510
but like a,
in my belief system,

885
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,231
uh,
there is,

886
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,200
uh,
uh,

887
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,620
a line be quick to see where religious 
people are,

888
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:20,200
right?
And this mindfulness example,

889
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:22,150
and possibly what you're saying about 
pilgrimage,

890
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,600
about purpose,
and when w w it anecdotally,

891
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:27,840
my experience of the world is even when 
I'm talking to people,

892
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,010
they feel lost,
unhappy,

893
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,280
disconnected,
you know,

894
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,114
like,
and you could arrive at these 

895
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:33,484
conclusions for Marxist theory that 
capitalism would lead to alienation and 

896
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:43,900
people feeling that their only function 
is an economic one or a productive one.

897
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,153
So as you're saying that these group of 
literally these traditional ideas such 

898
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,474
as pilgrimage,
is it a new way of reengaging with 

899
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,800
aspects of our consciousness that will 
be neglected?

900
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,210
Absolutely,
yes.

901
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,223
Well,
I think it's re-engaging because it's 

902
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:03,760
going on a journey to something that is 
bigger than you.

903
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,350
Um,
you know,

904
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,200
for example,
every year I've been doing this,

905
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,310
I have a Godson who's a teenager and you
know,

906
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,470
I feel as a godfather I should do 
something for his birthday.

907
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,304
And I think,
and it stopped giving stuff to people 

908
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:19,660
because I think everyone's got too much 
stuff.

909
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,540
So I give experiences.
And when he was 14,

910
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,920
I offered him,
I said,

911
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,880
my offer is a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
rewalk,

912
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,340
the last eight miles through fields on 
footpaths and words.

913
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,563
We go to the cathedral,
we light candles at the shrine of some 

914
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:38,060
Thomas go to choral even song,
which this beautiful service and um,

915
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,110
have a cream tea and come home on the 
high speed train.

916
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,670
And I said,
would you like to do that?

917
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,050
And slate?
Just to my surprise,

918
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:51,130
he said yes and we had a blissful day.
And we do that every year.

919
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,660
No two different cathedrals.

920
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,350
Beautiful.
How do you,

921
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,660
uh,
not that you need to,

922
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,130
other than in the context of this 
question,

923
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,300
I align your anglicanism with what 
you're saying about morphic resonance.

924
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:03,070
You know,
like a very,

925
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,570
what would people would deckard is 
conventional faith?

926
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,351
Well,
I mean,

927
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,184
it's not very conventional to be a 
Christian and modern Britain and you've 

928
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:15,340
got 5% of people go to church regularly.
Um,

929
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,503
so it's definitely not the power 
structure and nunes in it for the money 

930
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,990
anymore.
So,

931
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,913
um,
morphic resonance actually fits very 

932
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:27,304
well,
particularly in my book on science and 

933
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,550
spiritual practices.
One of them,

934
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,384
I discussed his rituals and all 
religions have rituals and secular 

935
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,304
cultures do as well.
And what are some rituals of secular 

936
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:40,660
culture?
Well,

937
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:43,090
the American thanksgiving festival for 
example,

938
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,953
so national ritual rituals,
reenact and original seminal moment in 

939
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,720
the history of a group.
So Jewish people for example,

940
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,550
reenact the Passover dinner that 
happened in Egypt when they fast

941
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,160
foreman for ancestor worship and 
connection.

942
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:00,994
And to demonstrate that we exist beyond 
our individual selves and the connected 

943
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:04,534
to our lineage.

944
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,643
Yes,
the back to an original event that sets 

945
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:08,194
the lineage in motion.
And so Christian holy communion is a 

946
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:16,231
ritual celebration of Jesus's last 
supper with his disciples itself,

947
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,130
a Passover dinner.
Um,

948
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:18,964
so it,
it's a kind of ancestral connection 

949
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:24,070
across time.
And the point about morphic resonance,

950
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:24,904
it depends on similarity.
Now if you have a ritual where you use 

951
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:30,230
the same language,
the same words,

952
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:32,220
the same gestures,
the same incense,

953
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:33,840
the same whatever,
um,

954
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,113
you deliberately create things as 
similar as possible and you set up 

955
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:39,620
perfect conditions for morphic 
resonance.

956
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,023
So in all cultures,
people believe that by doing these 

957
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:45,680
rituals,
they connect with our ancestors.

958
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,523
Have done them before,
right back to the first time it's done 

959
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,550
and it means the individual individuals 
much more than just me.

960
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,713
I'm part of a whole long tradition that 
went on long before me and we'll go on 

961
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:57,764
long after me.
And this whole tradition in any case is 

962
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,850
about something bigger than us because 
Jesus,

963
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,690
his last supper,
the Passover,

964
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,630
it was about more than just those 
people.

965
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:13,220
It was a in their own terms of an 
intervention of God into history.

966
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,860
Well,
I like that.

967
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,320
So my individual consciousness is just 
temporal,

968
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,250
but my consciousness has existed before 
me and my consciousness will exist after

969
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,440
me and my consciousness is part of a 
vital energy,

970
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:23,274
a continual pranic flow existing through
all forms existing beyond and through 

971
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:28,434
time and space,
time and space themselves being just 

972
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,224
referential points from this biological 
organism or this species of biological 

973
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,360
organisms that would be entirely 
different if we had different senses.

974
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,373
That consciousness is somehow reflecting
onto the screen of reality rules that 

975
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:45,174
are apparent to its own understanding 
and its own interaction with the 

976
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:51,210
external and through these rituals we 
can demonstrate it,

977
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:52,044
recreate it,
connect with it in a different way and 

978
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:57,360
see how we have existed like waves 
passing through time.

979
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,360
I like that.
But somehow stripped of mystery.

980
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:01,194
These things can seem like,
I imagine that some of our out there 

981
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:06,150
rather than more radical a listeners my 
thing,

982
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,013
you know the whole cause to me it sounds
bloody delightful going for the cream 

983
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:14,100
tea and the pilgrimage to Canterbury's 
or sort of thing I might do actually.

984
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,170
But like a lot of people think,
oh I ain't doing that.

985
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,990
Oh I want to do ios guy with a flick 
knife.

986
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,470
Buyer would so like you know,
so like it doesn't it seem,

987
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:23,304
it seems conventional.
Whilst you said it's like 5% day seems 

988
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,671
like,
I don't know,

989
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:28,350
what does it seem,
does it seem radical?

990
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:29,820
It seems,
but what is it?

991
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,190
That thing that I'm feeling,
it seems somehow,

992
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,203
I don't know,
safe like it's not going to change the 

993
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,184
world.
Like it's had its moment that it's 

994
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,940
nostalgic.
Is that what it is?

995
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,823
Well,
I think there's an element of that 

996
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,511
connection.
Well,

997
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:43,344
anything that connects,
I don't consider it nostalgics connect 

998
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:48,960
with tradition in the past.
I mean here in Britain for example,

999
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:49,794
we have incredible cathedrals and those 
were produced in the middle ages when 

1000
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,263
virtually everybody who believed that 
they were part of something bigger than 

1001
00:52:56,851 --> 00:52:57,684
themselves and the whole society,
I mean 3 million people with ox carts 

1002
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:04,840
and ropes and pulleys created all these 
incredible cathedrals.

1003
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:07,780
Cantor breed our own wells,
Salisbury of Centra,

1004
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,110
Westminster Abbey.
They thought they were part of something

1005
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:14,790
much,
much bigger than themselves.

1006
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,840
And they're still here today.
And I find them incredibly powerful.

1007
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,330
Um,
I don't think it's just nostalgia.

1008
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,170
I think they have a living presence and 
anyone who goes into them,

1009
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,660
um,
especially if you're getting listened to

1010
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,460
this evening service even song where 
everybody is it as this beautiful music.

1011
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,870
It's an extraordinarily beautiful and 
transforming experience.

1012
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,470
Now I've nothing against Iowasca and I 
wouldn't like to say this is,

1013
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,230
it's either all you see for me it's not 
either or.

1014
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,950
I think all the spiritual practices are 
part of what we can do.

1015
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,784
And there's many,
many spiritual practices we can take 

1016
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:55,170
part in meditations,
one rituals or another.

1017
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,663
And I was,
Kara has done as a kind of ritual as a 

1018
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:02,790
kind of sacramental communion where the 
participants,

1019
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,120
especially on these psychedelic churches
like Santo Dima.

1020
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,090
MMM,
that sounds good.

1021
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,200
This is a Brazilian,
there's a very big psychedelic church in

1022
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,780
Brazil.
It was two actually more than two,

1023
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:17,310
but the main ones are called sent who 
die.

1024
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:19,220
Me.
And when you went to Fsu,

1025
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,063
tyler,
which means union of plants and these 

1026
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:23,754
are churches I have been,
I suppose I suppose I should add a long 

1027
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:28,880
time ago.
Um,

1028
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,280
to services these churches in Canada 
actually watching the,

1029
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,390
so the one they liked be psychedelic 
charities.

1030
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,590
I'm fascinated why they've got good 
murals in them.

1031
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,330
[inaudible] they don't know the,
these not,

1032
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,263
they didn't have buildings.
I mean the wellies they may be doing in 

1033
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,650
Brazil,
but this is sort of in a room where they

1034
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:54,651
rent rooms and things.
So what they are at Inosanto,

1035
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,630
maybe men are all dressed in white on 
one side of the room,

1036
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:58,464
women on the other.
And it started to my surprise with 

1037
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,410
everyone reciting the our father and the
Hail Mary.

1038
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:05,244
And um,
and then there's the kind of community 

1039
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:11,510
where you all go up one after another 
and drink from this chalice of Iowasca.

1040
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,533
All right.
And then the whole group is traveling 

1041
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:17,130
together and the person leading it says,
you know,

1042
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:19,500
this isn't just personal tripping.
You know,

1043
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:22,740
we're all in this together and we're 
traveling like in a boat together.

1044
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,173
And there's periods when you sing 
together extraordinarily beautiful 

1045
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:26,994
songs.

1046
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,253
And then periods when everyone sits in 
silence and has kind of visionary 

1047
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,610
experiences.
In my case,

1048
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,963
for the first time he did,
and I was sort of zooming out of the 

1049
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:38,940
earth into the cosmos,
through the stars,

1050
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:41,730
and it was astonishing experience.
Um,

1051
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,580
and then you come back and there's 
another song.

1052
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,870
And as the country was very strong sense
of group solidarity.

1053
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:54,110
But I don't see that that is is um,
you know,

1054
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,300
I see that as a perfectly compatible 
with lots of other religious [inaudible]

1055
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,800
sat around having your cream tea.
I sounds much more radical to me.

1056
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,723
I went to this church repat in ladbroke 
grove quite by mistake as a matter of 

1057
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:09,930
fact.
I like I wonder then and it was,

1058
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,960
I like to discover Eritrean Christian 
folk.

1059
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,970
They had like a,
like a screen at the front.

1060
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,040
They will listen to pretty crazy 
keyboard music.

1061
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:17,874
Everyone else sat me with Airtran and a 
little kid at the back and a tiny 

1062
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:20,934
plastic chassis was,
seemed to be there in some sort of 

1063
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,090
administrative up the front

1064
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,620
was the pastor and a couple of other 
guys.

1065
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,500
It was pretty uh,
intense,

1066
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:31,580
you know like um,
let the,

1067
00:56:31,581 --> 00:56:35,440
it was like a feel Jesus type levels of 
stuff and a guy like,

1068
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,274
you know,
everyone was going out the front and 

1069
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:37,864
having like proper,
it looked to me like speaking in 

1070
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:41,920
tongues,
out of body kind of experiences.

1071
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,760
While I was watching this all happen 
from it,

1072
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,690
from the midst,
from the congregation,

1073
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,570
which was only about 30 or 40 people in 
this church.

1074
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,370
You know,
I was thinking how,

1075
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,550
how are we going to go home afterwards?
You know,

1076
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:56,230
how are we going to pick up our coats 
now?

1077
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,103
Car Keys and be normal again like after 
we have letting ourselves go after we 

1078
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:05,020
have dispensed temporarily with our 
identity is hello there cnn.

1079
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,883
I suppose this is what I mean while 
you're having a cream tea or you're 

1080
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,370
walking in a field is still essentially 
you,

1081
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:11,620
but while you're shooting through the 
cosmos on Iowaska,

1082
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,783
you asked if physically experiencing 
that you are not just your identity is 

1083
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:16,954
rupert or Russell or whoever you happen 
to be listening to this thing right now 

1084
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,753
and watching these Eritrean people in 
congregation of watched them having a 

1085
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:25,010
group experience that was clearly 
transcendent,

1086
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,090
which was clearly outside the accepted 
social rules.

1087
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,760
I've thought how will this sees,
how will it comes to cessation?

1088
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:31,594
I went to the front of my cell phone 
that the pastor did some ritual on me 

1089
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:39,580
and where my set killer mechanical 
condition mind would say that it was all

1090
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:44,380
Brouhaha and nonsense except for when 
like he offered me the healing.

1091
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:45,214
The place in my stomach that you grabbed
is exactly where I feel the pain when 

1092
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:48,784
alone anxious and full of doubt.
The place that you grabbed that was the 

1093
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:54,070
place where I feel the pain,
you know?

1094
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:54,904
And then at the end things did resolve 
quite perfectly and beautifully and 

1095
00:57:58,151 --> 00:58:01,210
people just chat it afterwards and went 
back to their jobs.

1096
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,044
In these cases,
I'm thinking a lot of these people were 

1097
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,640
cab drivers and doing pre low pay,
minimum paid,

1098
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:10,960
we'll jobs,
but they had there a communal experience

1099
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:13,960
and and I and a I transcendent 
experience.

1100
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:17,200
Certainly it was beyond the accepted 
social norms of how are you,

1101
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,000
what are you going to be doing next 
Wednesday?

1102
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,160
Did you see spurs the other night?
People were,

1103
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,060
and I feel that if you exclude that 
experience from your life,

1104
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,960
if your life does not include that,
then what are you doing?

1105
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,190
What are you doing?
Hmm.

1106
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,333
I agree.
I think that without that kind of 

1107
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:36,990
experience,
we lead very impoverished lives.

1108
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,003
Yes.
And that's why I think like you do that 

1109
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,390
spiritual practices and awareness of 
that dimension is so important.

1110
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,050
What should science,
how can science,

1111
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,390
which you know no one disputes that 
without science?

1112
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,250
No technology without science,
no medicine.

1113
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:54,020
All the things that you listed,
you know,

1114
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,360
the experimental method.
Absolutely vital.

1115
00:58:56,361 --> 00:58:58,370
But is there a,
what do you,

1116
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,160
what would your biggest hope be for 
science?

1117
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,820
I think first of all,
going beyond these narrow dogmas,

1118
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,140
hold it back.
My book,

1119
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,093
the Science Delusion in America is 
called science set free and it's really 

1120
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,953
the idea is that if we escaped from this
dogmatic prison that it's in at the 

1121
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:19,414
moment,
it could become much more positive and 

1122
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:21,514
life.
And I think that if we switch from a 

1123
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:25,214
view of nature as being dad,
unanimous and mechanical to a view of 

1124
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:34,721
nature as a living cosmos that's 
evolving with habits and that everything

1125
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,710
in nature is being alive.
Gaia,

1126
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,850
the earth,
the sun,

1127
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:39,440
the solar system,
the galaxy,

1128
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,570
plants and animals,
not machines,

1129
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:42,404
but truly alive.
We'll find ourselves in the living 

1130
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:48,890
world,
which has a kind of purpose is not clear

1131
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:49,724
what it is,
but it we'd feel much more connected if 

1132
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:55,010
we feed ourselves part of the living 
world.

1133
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,413
And then the kind of spiritual 
principles that give rise to that world 

1134
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:04,070
or the creative forces that underlying 
would become,

1135
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,353
we'd feel they were more relevant and 
closer to us and we'd see God in nature 

1136
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:10,250
and God in us.
And,

1137
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,503
um,
uh,

1138
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,760
and I think then when that happens,
our lives become much more connected,

1139
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:19,940
much more meaningful and much happier 
too.

1140
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,850
Yes,
that's very,

1141
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:22,684
very beautiful.
And I can't see why that would be 

1142
01:00:23,981 --> 01:00:26,860
controversial at all to regard the world
in those terms.

1143
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,310
Rupert sheldrake your book,
I'm telling you this,

1144
01:00:30,311 --> 01:00:31,360
but really,
you know it,

1145
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,090
your book,
just going to let you know in your book,

1146
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:37,720
science and spiritual practices is 
available now.

1147
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,040
I,
uh,

1148
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,980
I thank you very much.
I really enjoyed talking to you.

1149
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:42,814
I really enjoy listening to you.
I find it incredibly valuable and 

1150
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:49,951
beautiful and to invest the world around
us with love and not to feel that we are

1151
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:52,320
just components in a,
uh,

1152
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:55,390
a mindless and purpose less machine for 
me.

1153
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:57,130
This is not just,
Oh,

1154
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,990
this cheers me up on,
you know,

1155
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:00,670
on my road to the bone yard.
No,

1156
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:03,460
it also just feels like it has truth.
When I think of nature,

1157
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,830
when I think of my experience with 
psychedelics,

1158
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:06,903
it seems to confirm that there are 
forces beyond that which can be 

1159
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:14,680
understood through the limited senses,
that there is information available that

1160
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:16,800
can't be understood within the existing 
template.

1161
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,720
It seems to be bloody obvious as a 
matter of fact,

1162
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,320
and that nature does seem like an uh,
uh,

1163
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,130
um,
in motion,

1164
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,330
a living beautiful thing rather than a 
mechanical resource.

1165
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:31,330
But if you start looking at nature as 
something other than a resource,

1166
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:32,164
a lot of economic interests and 
political interests would be strongly 

1167
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:36,610
challenged.
Yes.

1168
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,133
Anywhere.
It's a great pleasure to don't try and 

1169
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:42,650
wrap it up.
I'm the host of the thing.

1170
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:43,830
Well,
all right,

1171
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,780
but I think you're getting signals.
You're meant to be wrapping it up.

1172
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,640
Refresh your drink.
I want to go bloody Cathedra with yeah,

1173
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,200
it would take us in all about one.
Yeah,

1174
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,920
I word yes.
I'd love to go with you.

1175
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:58,100
We'd go to a cathedral would walk 
through a field and like weird.

1176
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,120
Let me just have a cream tea and then 
we'd go work aphasia.

1177
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:01,970
Which ones?
The best ones?

1178
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,833
Dharam cancer.
Well we could start with Westminster 

1179
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,820
Abbey,
which is quite spectacular and amazing.

1180
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:08,863
Really?
Yeah.

1181
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,620
And they do choral even song practically
every day.

1182
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,160
Even song.
You mentioned it all the time.

1183
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,830
You're not the best.
It's the best way.

1184
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:16,664
And I mean I've,
you've done done this empirically know 

1185
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,730
what works for people.
Um,

1186
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:26,130
if people are committed Christians,
holy communion is the best way.

1187
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,530
And,
but if people are not used to that,

1188
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,610
then choral even song is something that 
can include everybody.

1189
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,260
And um,
it's extremely beautiful and it lasts 45

1190
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:40,050
minutes and it happens every day.
In all know cathedrals.

1191
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,573
What's,
there's a website that I helped set up 

1192
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:47,730
called choral even song.org
where you can find out when the next one

1193
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,564
is,
what they're singing and what kind of 

1194
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:50,844
choir too.
I'm gonna investigate what it was like 

1195
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:53,850
for those people.
We've ropes and policing.

1196
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,340
Awesome.
Current building them cathedral up.

1197
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:58,500
It was the right bull lake erecting 
them.

1198
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:01,890
Dragging great stones around norritch.
Exactly,

1199
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:04,230
but what they did is endured to this 
day.

1200
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:08,760
Whereas what people do by buying things 
and throw away culture,

1201
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,170
lenny juror in rubbish.
Heaps for the for centuries to come.

1202
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,740
Thank you.
More cathedral fueled s iphone though.

1203
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:18,930
You're probably not listening to this on
the Cathedral.

1204
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,560
Thanks very much rupert sheldrake.
Thank you.

1205
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,950
Thanks gs.
That show was sponsored by recovery,

1206
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:27,784
which you can buy now on Amazon or you 
can get it as an audio book or you can 

1207
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:30,814
buy it on your device and you could see 
me read most of it basically on my 

1208
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,473
facebook feed them or I'd read it out.
Great Chunks of at can't shut up about 

1209
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:37,924
the damn thing.
Also come see me on my rebirth till we 

1210
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:43,450
had to reschedule some dates.
So I'm in Coventry,

1211
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:45,700
eight for November.
Less stuff for eat for November.

1212
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:49,540
Stoke for even.
November is a great show is live.

1213
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,940
Fill in the survey.
You will have a wild,

1214
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:55,050
wild time there.
I signed books in the interval.

1215
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,220
I come right out.
I'm very,

1216
01:03:57,221 --> 01:04:00,370
very available.

Finally,

1218
01:04:01,391 --> 01:04:04,660
if you like this show,
please subscribe to it and review it and

1219
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:05,494
get your friends listening to form 
little groups where people gather and 

1220
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,390
perhaps build churches to it.
Why not?

1221
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,120
Are you listening to this in the future 
after I've passed on,

1222
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:13,983
right?
Why not canonize me and make me a sane 

1223
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,880
in a proper all rise too much or just 
give it five stars.

1224
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:21,040
You don't have to start a religion.
I know how difficult that can be.

1225
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,660
I'm trying to start me own one right 
now.

1226
01:04:22,661 --> 01:04:25,990
It's knackering right island,
right then.
