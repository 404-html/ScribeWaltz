Ed stafford is a survivalist explorer 
and adventurer,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,433
an internationally acclaimed 
motivational speaker and author who has 

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,274
been described as Britain's most 
intrepid hero since Scott of the 

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:12,994
Antarctic.
He's experienced extremes all over the 

5
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:19,660
world and is the Guinness World record 
holding first man to walk the Amazon.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,033
Ed splits his life between filming 
around the world and spending time at 

7
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:23,974
home in London.
He blogs about anything related to 

8
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:29,350
adventure,
remote travel and health and fitness.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,290
Ed Stafford,
frank,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,650
you for very much for coming on under 
the skin.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,543
Absolute pleasure.
What fascinates me most about your work 

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,873
as a sort of a survivalist or an 
adventurer is the way that you talk 

13
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,740
about the,
uh,

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,663
sort of conscious and spiritual 
component of surviving in extreme 

15
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,704
situations,
but in a way your background is 

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,140
traditional in the sense that you're 
from the military,

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,830
is straight into the skin then,
isn't it really?

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,673
Uh,
I,

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,020
I think so.
I mean,

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,490
I've always thought it was,
um,

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm,
I'm in the world of adventure.

22
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,790
Have done it off the back of a military 
career.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,160
And yet,
for me,

24
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:14,910
the sort of the obvious parts of 
adventure that crossing rivers,

25
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:16,680
climbing mountains,
sort of toughing it out,

26
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,560
don't,
don't really interest me as merchant the

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,540
psychological aspects.
Clearly I think,

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,100
um,
you know,

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,470
there is a very physical element in 
everything I do,

30
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,000
but the whole thing since the military 
onwards has been,

31
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,640
uh,
has been a bit of a spiritual journey.

32
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:30,474
And,
and it's just,

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,683
it's,
it's interesting for me how such a sort 

34
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,554
of stereotypical blokey bloke's job has 
ended up being actually one which has 

35
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,204
been quite,
um,

36
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,040
quite okay.

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,180
Sort of spiritual journey.
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,030
That is fascinating.
That's perhaps what fascinates me most.

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,893
Was that something that it a 
superficially seems to be about over 

40
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,840
modes of masculinity such as toughness,
insurance,

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,580
survival optimally in your view,
comes down to our spirituality.

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,540
I think.
I think it's evolved at the most.

43
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,374
I think

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,570
when I started,
when I,

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
for example,
wanted to walk the length of the Amazon,

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,383
I think there was a lot of ego involved.
I think I really wanted to prove to the 

47
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,010
world that I was super turf,
beat my chest and um,

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,380
do something that everyone was saying 
was impossible.

49
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,214
And so,
um,

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,900
in fact that really annoyed me,
you know,

51
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,734
everyone said,
no,

52
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,933
you're going to die,
or they laughed at me or they didn't 

53
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,490
think it was possible and I was just 
like,

54
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,990
I'm just going to prove him wrong.
It was literally a two finger salute to,

55
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,550
to those sort of naysayers.
And I think,

56
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,384
um,
just because it started in quite a sort 

57
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:35,011
of a macho way,
I suppose it's taken me by surprise,

58
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,850
the journey it's taken me on because 
there's nothing macho about what I do is

59
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,160
the moment,
you know,

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,640
it,
I really don't need to prove anything to

61
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,360
anyone.

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,130
And again,
maybe this is just an age thing.

63
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:46,964
I'm 41 now.
So I think as you get older you don't 

64
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:52,220
need to show off quite as much as he did
as a kid.

65
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,960
But um,
but,

66
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,950
um,
yeah,

67
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:57,080
certainly I think that what I'm doing 
now is quite a,

68
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,510
it's quite meaningful and,
and I don't,

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,170
I don't know,
it,

70
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,980
it keeps me learning.
It keeps me in a position of being quite

71
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,470
humble as well.
When you were in the military,

72
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,163
my superficial and inexperienced 
intuitive understanding of life in the 

73
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,164
military is that a must be extremely 
testing on you physically and mentally 

74
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:21,940
and it must be a lot about making 
individuals behave in a cohesive way and

75
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,774
respond well to all 40.
What was that like for you as an 

76
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,784
individual?
What would you like for your mental 

77
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,550
health at the time you spent in the 
army?

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,310
And if I'm honest,
I don't think I,

79
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,020
um,
I took to the army at all.

80
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,854
Well I'm a joins because I wanted to 
roll around in the burden throughout an 

81
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,960
outdoor job and not sit behind a desk.
And,

82
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,270
and in that respect it's always correct,
but I never really.

83
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,323
There's a fear that I don't know whether
you understand when we even see a 

84
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,000
military camp and all that barbwire 
around the outside.

85
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,963
When I go into Cam,
I would get properly scared inside on 

86
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,344
the left as a captain.
You shouldn't arguably be scared of the 

87
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,740
campus if you're,
if you're,

88
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,220
if you're at that level.
Um,

89
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,880
and yet I did a,
it was a very disciplined environment.

90
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,150
It was a very strict environment and it 
is one that is run on,

91
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,760
run on discipline and,
and,

92
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,990
um,
sort of regime.

93
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:11,980
And that wasn't me at all.

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,853
Um,
I might have taken a lot from the 

95
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,450
military,
but I've always been quite a free spirit

96
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
and I've always liked the ability to do 
what I want to do and get up in the 

97
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,760
morning and I'd like to plan my own day 
rather than,

98
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,853
you know,
for the next six months in advance has 

99
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:26,740
been planned for you.
And so it was never really me.

100
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,843
Even in training at Santa Stowe was not 
counting the days til I finished 

101
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,810
training,
which the other recruits were.

102
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,310
I was counting the days to actually 
could leave the military because I could

103
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,540
tell it wasn't really.
And yet it was something I almost did as

104
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,423
a of finishing school and all,
it's given me the skills I needed to do 

105
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,904
what I'm doing now.
How did you flourish in an environment 

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,353
that was so counter to the way you 
wanted to be in the way you saw 

107
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:50,380
yourself?

108
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,720
How did you,
because you obviously succeeded,

109
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:56,110
you've got to the rank of captain.
How many years were you in the military?

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,580
I was,
I was in for four years.

111
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,740
I didn't flourish if I'm honest.
Um,

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,260
I,
I,

113
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,060
I feel like I've come into myself in 
more recent years.

114
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:07,420
I'm in my early thirties rather than I'm
in my mid twenties.

115
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,500
Was,
was when I was in the military.

116
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,334
I remember telling my commanding officer
that I was gonna leave and he just 

117
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,171
smiled and said,
yeah,

118
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,250
that's probably best,
isn't it?

119
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,450
I mean,
I literally,

120
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,440
I wasn't that good because I think,
I don't think I was into it,

121
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:22,690
you know,
I didn't have any interest in guns.

122
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:23,524
You know,
people go on Stag do's to Las Vegas and 

123
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,550
she just leaves me cold.
I'm not interested in.

124
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,060
I did spend time in Afghanistan and the 
other consultants,

125
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,500
they were,
um,

126
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,400
they couldn't wait to decommission the 
weapons off the Afghans so they could go

127
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,234
into the middle of the,
into the middle of the desert and shoot 

128
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,500
bazookas and stuff and that I just,
it's just not me at all.

129
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,440
And invariably you can bluff your case 
for a little while and then after awhile

130
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,960
reached the rank of captain and the 
thought,

131
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,440
this is about as senior as I want to go.
Bluff in my case,

132
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,373
I'm sure there's more to life as well.
With the battalion was going back to 

133
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,980
Northern Ireland for two more years and 
doing a really quite difficult

134
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,560
jobs to keep the soldiers motivated in 
those sort of environments.

135
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,970
And so I decided it was time to leave.
What I personally,

136
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:04,804
I have tremendous respect for anybody 
that can endure the military because 

137
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,340
when I imagined myself in those kinds of
environments,

138
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:13,990
when you took right individuality in a,
a necessity respond to discipline.

139
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:14,824
That makes me feel really scared.
And the idea that you said about the 

140
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,254
camp,
but I also have this sense that the 

141
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,850
military,
you'd refer to it as a finishing school,

142
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:22,684
might be a place where greatness is 
accessed in that you are tested as an 

143
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:27,604
individual and like the whether or not 
you can overcome and some mount certain 

144
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,200
challenges.
Is that fair?

145
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:35,020
Is that what it was like in some ways in
retrospect?

146
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,303
Yeah.
A lot of the explorers around the world 

147
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,660
have been in the military,
a runoff fines and you know,

148
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,460
all of the people who have made a name 
for themselves.

149
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,730
And I think there is a reason for that.
I think it gave me a set of skills.

150
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:52,990
It gave me not just the physical skills 
packing a work site and navigating those

151
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:53,824
sort of very obvious wounds,
but also it allowed me to think 

152
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:57,790
flexibly,
bizarrely.

153
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,740
And you'd think that the military would 
be quite,

154
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:02,050
um,
regimented with the way it thinks.

155
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:03,670
But they have got this thing called 
mission command,

156
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:04,504
which essentially means if you know the 
end state of what you're trying to 

157
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,620
achieve.
So your commanding officers told you the

158
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:11,454
end state,
it's up to you as to how you do it and 

159
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,600
um,
so it does allow a lot of flexibility,

160
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,480
conquer that area or get you to that 
place,

161
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,600
attack that trench and it's up to you as
to whether you go,

162
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,340
you know,
through the stream,

163
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,240
straight up the middle or around the 
forest and to recover or whatever it is.

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,370
So enjoyable.
That side of things.

165
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,030
I think when I came out,
when I started leading expeditions,

166
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:34,864
it was good to be able to know that I 
could deal with situations and I can be 

167
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,324
flexible.
So I did massively have to take my 

168
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,950
military hat off in many respects 
because,

169
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,113
you know,
a lot of the people that I was dealing 

170
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:48,130
with were local people,
indigenous people from potentially third

171
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,470
world countries.
And you can't just go in there with your

172
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,304
sort of army hat on telling people what 
to do or expecting things to run like 

173
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,054
clockwork because it just,
you'll just end up exploding out of 

174
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:57,784
sheer frustration.
So I had to completely take that off 

175
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,840
trip,
chuck it all away quite frankly.

176
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,723
And,
and,

177
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,613
and I,
I'm happy to share that side of the 

178
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,200
military,
you know,

179
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,210
as I go on year by year,
the military has less and less influence

180
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,950
over who I am today.
Definitely.

181
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,860
Did it,
did you,

182
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,861
while you were in the military question 
the agenda and the objectives and this I

183
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:23,410
suppose that inherently what is within 
military is,

184
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,120
uh,
the idea of force,

185
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,880
the idea of coercion,
the idea of control.

186
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,480
So there are a lot of things like on a,
on the level of our national identity,

187
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,870
we have to conceal about the role of the
military.

188
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,970
I'm not talking to individual soldiers 
who is very,

189
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:37,804
very brave that anyone's prepared to put
himself through that kind of suffering 

190
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:40,714
and I admire them,
but I'm talking about like the sort of 

191
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,160
the political objectives of a military 
organization,

192
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:45,994
for example in Northern Ireland.
And we'll just take one very complex 

193
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,530
subject to that sort of stuff.
Trouble you.

194
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,590
Um,
I think,

195
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,424
um,
I never really believed in the Northern 

196
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,380
Ireland occupation,
you know,

197
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,214
when we're out there.
And that was therefore difficult to put 

198
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,910
on a and official face.
I was in charge of 30 soldiers.

199
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,050
They were looking to me to sort of,
um,

200
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,433
lead them through this,
through this experience of occupying a 

201
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,280
another nation,
you know,

202
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,750
and okay,
we weren't fighting,

203
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,330
but you know,
we were unwanted there,

204
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,600
you know,
I was spit in the face.

205
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,730
Really?
You're kidding me.

206
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,220
You've had that happen.
Of course,

207
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,273
of course.
Every and every British army soldier 

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,233
that's,
that's done any patrols in Northern 

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,730
Ireland would have had that happen.
What?

210
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,813
But if you think about it,
if it was your back yard and suddenly 

211
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,333
observation Qataris are going up and 
people are spying on your houses and 

212
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,840
stuff,
you'd be pretty outraged to.

213
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,050
And so I don't feel any negativity 
towards anything.

214
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,933
No people that did that.
I didn't believe in what I was doing if 

215
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,940
I didn't deliver.
So that must be.

216
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:44,774
I imagine it'd be hard enough if you,
if one had the mentality of queen and 

217
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:52,210
country and the right of the British 
Empire to Ra and occupy other territory.

218
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,930
So it would still be out if someone spit
in your face.

219
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,230
But if you sort of felt it was wrong 
anyway,

220
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,660
did it just feel like the physical 
representation of your own doubts?

221
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,513
I think.
I think if you sign up for some things 

222
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,990
sometimes,
and this is really tricky,

223
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:06,830
isn't it?
Because when you,

224
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,643
because everyone.
Well I've developed over the course of 

225
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,703
years and ability to tell whether 
something's right or wrong by sort of 

226
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:15,400
trusting my gut,
you know,

227
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,640
intuitively know whether you should be 
doing something that didn't.

228
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,853
And Yeah,
I'd signed up to an organization which 

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,110
it's got nothing to do with feelings or 
intuition.

230
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:23,944
It was just literally this is your 
orders and this is what you've got to 

231
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,250
do.
And I kind of just,

232
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,213
I've got to admit,
I kind of just accepted that this is a 

233
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,490
role that you've got to fulfill for the 
next year or two years or whatever.

234
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,110
And once you've done it,
you can.

235
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:37,990
Then you can then break free and live 
your life as you want to do it.

236
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:40,360
So I think I just sucked it up and got 
on with it

237
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,610
at the time.
I wouldn't go back to it now.

238
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,230
I said,
what was it then?

239
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,690
So having been schooled,
hardened,

240
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,730
trained,
taught by the military,

241
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,970
or how was it that you found yourself 
attracted to the seemingly impossible?

242
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:55,324
Uh,
I know that you were strongly advised 

243
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:57,874
against trying to walk the Amazon not 
least because it's made of water and 

244
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:02,650
then new cheeses can do that,
that you know,

245
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:05,590
that you were at five today,
these were insurmountable challenges.

246
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,653
What,
what happened to you in a period from 

247
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:09,274
leaving the military term,
taking on these great physical and 

248
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,870
psychological trials?
What,

249
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,700
what made you think you could do it and 
why did you want to do?

250
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,050
I think as much as the military,
it,

251
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,053
I didn't get on with it for the reasons 
that I've explained what I did like is 

252
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,860
being outdoors and what I did like his 
physical challenges and,

253
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,630
and um,
and spending time next to nature,

254
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,464
I've got to be honest.
And so the first job I took when coming 

255
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,360
out of the military was taking gap year 
kids on,

256
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,970
um,
on trips into the rain forest.

257
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,580
So they were building a new visitor 
center for National Park or something.

258
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,380
And you know,
18 to 24 year olds,

259
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,214
they're having a life changing 
experience and I got the chance to use 

260
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,270
the knife skills that come out with the 
military,

261
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,130
have been able to take them into the 
jungle safely.

262
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,443
There'd be sleeping in hammocks and 
Washington rivers and maybe doing a 

263
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,700
project which has got an ecological aim 
or community based Damon.

264
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,593
And that was,
it was perfect as far as I was 

265
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,010
concerned.
I was living at almost,

266
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,133
you know,
I've got paid next to nothing for that 

267
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:02,974
job because it was charity work,
but it was using all the really nice 

268
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,304
touchy feely part of it was taking the,
it was taking the army or expedition 

269
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,620
knowledge and actually putting it to 
good purpose.

270
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,030
So,
you know,

271
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,870
there were,
there was always a conservation or,

272
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,830
or community aim and mission to,
to each one of the expeditions.

273
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,840
And I flourished in that environment.
I loved it.

274
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,430
I did it for about eight or nine years 
actually.

275
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:26,200
And um,
and really enjoyed it.

276
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,290
What did you learn during that?
Well,

277
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,610
it was more,
obviously I'm not ordering people around

278
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,680
paying volunteers coming on these trips.
And it was,

279
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,210
um,
it was more just about letting go of all

280
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,044
of the,
all of the worries and all of the fears 

281
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,190
that have,
that I'd had building,

282
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,260
being in the military.

283
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,213
Suddenly people are all around me,
were having an amazing life changing 

284
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,350
experiences.
And you know,

285
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,593
if when you pull people into the jungle 
like that and everyone's wearing the 

286
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,810
same grubby trousers and shirt and you 
know,

287
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,010
there's,
there's no fashion,

288
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,620
there's no phones,
there's everything stripped away.

289
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,454
And yet people,
almost every single person on these 

290
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,684
expeditions at the time would have said,
this has been the most amazing thing 

291
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,400
I've ever done in my life because they 
come together.

292
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,110
They bond,
they weren't really hard.

293
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:14,620
They're living in this almost like a 
commune in the middle of it,

294
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,120
in the middle of the jungle.
And it,

295
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,430
I think it was extraordinarily 
rewarding.

296
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,480
It taught people,
you know,

297
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,660
what life's about,
how to look after each other,

298
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,890
how to work as a team.
And it was,

299
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,690
it was a youth development charity as 
well.

300
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:26,524
So it was all about these people who 
probably didn't know anything about 

301
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:28,810
life.

302
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,420
And this is the first time they've 
properly traveled away from home,

303
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,583
but they've done it in quite a safe,
organized way because it's led by 

304
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,320
someone like me who is ex military.
But um,

305
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
I don't know.
It almost.

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,433
Yeah.
Almost every single person that I'm in 

307
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,234
contact with,
a lot of the volunteers that came on 

308
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,160
those trips,
just,

309
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,083
it literally,
it changed their attitudes towards each 

310
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,060
other,
change their attitudes towards nature,

311
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,400
and they've got a huge amount of it.
People began to feel connected when they

312
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,530
talk to each other and to nature and to 
who they really are,

313
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,713
I suppose with what we ca.
What's implicit in that is that living 

314
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,670
in a civilized culture disconnects you 
from yourself.

315
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,860
One Star,
two star,

316
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:08,694
or we start to form attachments to 
material objects to things that aren't 

317
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,564
real.
Like the way that we envisage people 

318
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,120
isn't investigated for when people are 
put into an environment that is stripped

319
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,420
back,
the reason they feel so grateful,

320
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,700
so connected is because they discover 
some kind of truth.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,833
And I suppose the spirituality in 
essence is about the discovery of truth 

322
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,710
and the fact that the car.
But the truth is beautiful.

323
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,440
The truth is connection,
not alienation.

324
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,870
Last despair.
Yeah.

325
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,510
And I think you hit the nail on the head
by saying it's not really.

326
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,670
I wasn't adding anything.
I was just stripping stuff away.

327
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,080
So yeah,
all the nonsense,

328
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,940
all of the phones,
all of the distractions,

329
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:46,960
all of the,
you know,

330
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,530
things that will turn to when we're not 
feeling good drugs,

331
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,030
cigarettes,
chocolate,

332
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,500
whatever it is.
There aren't any of those,

333
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,393
you know,
and everyone was having to deal with a 

334
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,540
very raw version of each other.
And I think that was lovely for star and

335
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,823
you know,
back in the day people used to tell 

336
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:08,160
stories didn't and you know,
we would light a fire in the evening and

337
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,350
cook on it and then sit around and chat 
to each other.

338
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:11,184
There was nothing else to do.
And so you're looking up at the stars 

339
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,150
you're contemplating.
And it was again,

340
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,490
a world stripped away of the nonsense,
I think.

341
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,270
Yeah.
Well,

342
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,040
his trip to have a nonsense means that 
people go within themselves,

343
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,830
but I don't imagine it's just plain 
sailing or sort of,

344
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:27,400
you know,
sort of a communal trumpton about people

345
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,230
go through a lot of English,
don't they?

346
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:32,860
I mean I filled a part of.
I'm very attracted to what you do.

347
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,400
I admire it very much,
but it's with myself.

348
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,910
There's quite a lot of fear in there.
If I think right,

349
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,440
you've got to go and live in the woods.
You're not going to have your phone.

350
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,150
You're not gonna have a lot.
There's a phrase,

351
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,250
isn't there?
We become prisoners of comfort.

352
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,263
I feel that I am in many ways a prisoner
of comfort that I have not tested 

353
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:50,134
myself.
I used to do this thing and this seems 

354
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:53,590
like a mad thing to tell her survival 
explorer because it's so lightweight,

355
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,693
but like I went to,
went out with this woman who had an 

356
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:00,610
amazing state in the grounds of the 
estate was a well beautiful.

357
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,130
Well the east stinking marsh pond.
Right?

358
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,320
And I have to jump in it.
Right.

359
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,450
And when you jump in it,
it was really cold.

360
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,860
It was freezing.
Then when you got in there,

361
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,753
when I got in there,
I go there and I'd think well like that 

362
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:14,944
my body is capable not only of 
experiencing that cold but also capable 

363
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:18,934
of making that noise and all the time 
they are not experiencing that code on 

364
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,754
making that noise.
I'm disconnected from the guy that can 

365
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:26,224
handle that.
So I'm like bobbing about just on the 

366
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:29,224
surface of who I am.
Never experiencing the truth of just as 

367
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:35,350
me as an individual on a sort of an 
anatomical,

368
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,184
physical and essential way.
So imagining that in that is a tiny 

369
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,160
pipsqueak scrap of the thing that you're

370
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,960
in a right that you think.
I think.

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,410
I think you're right.
I mean there's A.

372
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,243
There's a movement at the moment I'm 
with amongst disillusion people working 

373
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:54,630
in London called going on a micro 
adventure and people will literally sort

374
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,690
of five to nine I think is the 
catchphrase.

375
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,563
They'll leave work at five.
They'll take a train out into the 

376
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,200
countryside though,
run up a hill,

377
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,063
sleep on top of a hill in the morning,
go and jump in a river and then get it 

378
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,424
back on the train and being for work the
next day and I think that's quite 

379
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,130
indicative of the,
of,

380
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,203
of just people not being satisfied with 
this kind of mundane life and they want 

381
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,780
to eat really experienced life and 
obviously it's uncomfortable sleeping on

382
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:16,614
the hill,
it's know bloody cold jumping into the 

383
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,390
water and none of these things that are 
actually conventionally good fun and yet

384
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,710
it somehow does press a reset button.
It somehow does enable them to go in the

385
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,133
next day to work with a smile on their 
face and feeling like they've actually 

386
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,524
done something and it's very difficult 
to actually explain why they're doing 

387
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,660
it.
But I'm certainly,

388
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:42,810
I feel there is more to life than just,
I don't know,

389
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,470
getting on the tube and going to work 
and sitting at a desk.

390
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not interested in being a number 
like that.

391
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,650
I want to experience as much of life as 
possible.

392
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,170
So like in a way we can sort of build an
idea that urbanization,

393
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,063
industrial industrialization and the 
technological society is a way of 

394
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,080
turning people into kind of the fuel for
giant factory.

395
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,063
Your role just becomes to,
as a producer and as a consumer in many 

396
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:09,534
cases more a consumer than a producer.
Your connection to nature and reality 

397
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,900
has been severed.
You're on the tube,

398
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,793
but you're saying that these micro 
adventures are examples of people have 

399
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:19,824
this yearning for what's real.
And Are you saying that this year and 

400
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:23,614
any something you always add that you 
felt I don't want to do some job where 

401
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,470
I'm basically in some version of prison

402
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,673
and I'm trying to.
I reckon I reckon feelings more 

403
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,023
personally now,
I reckon feeling is more important than 

404
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,113
than thought.
And I think we all get lost in our 

405
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,070
heads.
You know,

406
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,710
we all anxieties,
fears,

407
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,720
all this sort of nonsense going on in 
our heads all the time.

408
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:45,554
And I think what I'm talking about is 
just experiences which sometimes aren't 

409
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:49,454
logical.
Why am I going to go in jumping out 

410
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,510
stream the.
It's having a very,

411
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,344
very visceral experience.
It's certainly shocking or your body 

412
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:59,690
senses it's making you feel alive again,
and it's,

413
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,970
and it's very hard to describe 
logically.

414
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:04,550
And I've got,
I've got some really,

415
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,460
really good aboriginal Australian 
friends and um,

416
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,930
and they went toe to me,
is that,

417
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:12,230
in fact,
the first time I met this guy,

418
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,064
he's like,
um,

419
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,293
we sat in the car,
nobody sat in the room for about five 

420
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:18,090
minutes and obviously thinking about 
those things,

421
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,983
I know of two,
five minutes he went and will you shut 

422
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:20,694
the fuck up?

423
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,820
Because there were so many thoughts 
going around my brain.

424
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:24,654
And like from an aboriginal perspective,
they'll try and tell this story quite 

425
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,040
shortly.
But he,

426
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,740
they believe that,
um,

427
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,740
you've got three brains,
the biggest brain being your,

428
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,893
your gut and your instincts.
The second biggest brain being your 

429
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,444
heart and your emotions in the smallest 
brain being the logical brain and the 

430
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:43,130
word that they use to describe the 
logical brain is called Nando.

431
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,373
Nando is also the word that they use to 
describe a fishing net that was all 

432
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,040
tangled beyond repair or fucked in their
words.

433
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,000
And that's the word they used to 
describe the logical brain and they said

434
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:54,834
the reason that western people confused 
live so much is that they live in this 

435
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,550
logical brain and it,
it's a tool.

436
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:02,350
Everything is meant to start.
And the guy,

437
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,360
you know,
all of your,

438
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,280
everything that you do or the way you 
live,

439
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:07,250
your life is all starts down here and 
okay,

440
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,260
it gets filtered by your heart and your 
emotions and then it Latin.

441
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,103
It gets filtered in the lesser manner by
your logic and your and your logical 

442
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,194
brain.
But this for me immediately explained 

443
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,503
it.
It just made everything click into 

444
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,190
place.
He's like,

445
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,720
it's not that,
that's not going to place.

446
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,400
It has,
it's a filter on the way out.

447
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,210
But everything has to originate.
And you know,

448
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,930
all sorts of expressions.
We've got expressions in our,

449
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,460
in our own culture,
you know,

450
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,300
you follow your gut,
but they,

451
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,270
they really genuinely believe.
And I,

452
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,210
I have to admit,
I have taken on the same bullish.

453
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:41,640
I think everything should originate.
And I the thing you know,

454
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,563
to live your life in an urban society 
where you're constantly watching the 

455
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,600
clock and you're in time and stresses 
and all this sort of stuff,

456
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,463
it's all in your head isn't.
And all they were doing was to try and 

457
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:54,364
tell me,
and I did it because I was going to go 

458
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,370
put myself on a desert island.

459
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,890
So I thought they will be good people to
speak to about this.

460
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,690
And they said,
the more you live in your head,

461
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,530
the more problems you will have.
The more anxieties and fears and doubts.

462
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,713
And they were absolutely right.
The more you can come from an 

463
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,690
instinctual place,
it's all of that.

464
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,910
It just evaporates in and you can live 
in,

465
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,753
you can,
you can have a decent time on the 

466
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,370
island.
Paris,

467
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,203
great wisdom.
How did you go from being the man in a 

468
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:18,934
car that's like baptist?
I shut the fuck up too because you're 

469
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,690
thinking too loudly.
How did you.

470
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,540
What did you learn from them and how do 
you do that?

471
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,913
And it's been a long journey.
I mean the Amazon was two and a half 

472
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:34,240
years that time isolated completely.
I'm earned on the island was 60 days,

473
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:35,074
which is a long time in complete 
isolation was 60 days in complete 

474
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,410
isolation.

475
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,600
Well,
I'll be completely honest.

476
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,470
I was l twice and twice.
They sent in a because I had a satellite

477
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,304
phone to call in case there was twice.
They brought in course of antibiotics 

478
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:51,070
but then left me again.
But other than what did you feel like in

479
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,870
the moments when someone drops off the 
antibiotics?

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,220
He talked to me.
Hold me.

481
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,710
You would think.
I would think that I got angry at myself

482
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:01,840
immediately.
I called use the satellite phone.

483
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:04,910
I got angry that I was breaking this 
sort of a rule that you'd say,

484
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,920
you know,
I was going to have 60 days in isolation

485
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:09,070
and you know,
why didn't you call?

486
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,060
What is that?
Well,

487
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,120
because I'm not a doctor.
I didn't know what was wrong.

488
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:14,650
I was like,
what were you experiencing?

489
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,413
Cramps and pains,
which I think the first one was trapped 

490
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,943
when something so in a,
and yet I'd obviously got myself and 

491
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,384
it's very difficult to describe.
I don't know whether you've spent 

492
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,680
extended periods of time in isolation.
No,

493
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,030
may bucks.
Ten minutes.

494
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,700
I started free out,
but it's far from a,

495
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,480
from a spiritual perspective.
It was one of the most,

496
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,883
one of the biggest catalyst I think I've
ever experienced because there was 

497
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,800
nowhere to hide.
It was,

498
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,000
um,
it was like a mirror to yourself,

499
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,530
but,
you know,

500
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,490
I couldn't distract myself in any way 
because there was nobody else there that

501
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,560
it was almost like the enormity of just 
being in my own presence was,

502
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:55,300
um,
was overwhelming enormity.

503
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,330
Okay.
I think it's again,

504
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,470
quite difficult to explain,
but,

505
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,304
um,
I think we all live our lives and I 

506
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:12,400
certainly used to in a way where you 
bounce off other people.

507
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,130
So I,
you know,

508
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:15,964
in this interview,
I'm constantly reading signals off year 

509
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,800
in order to get an interpretation of how
I'm behaving,

510
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,650
you know,
uh,

511
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,950
the fact that the producer next to me,
it isn't,

512
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,120
you know,
jumping up and down.

513
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,751
It's like,
okay,

514
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,840
things are going okay so I can continue 
to live my life in this way,

515
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,260
strip all of that feedback away so it's 
just you certainly your sense of self is

516
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,690
like,
well,

517
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:38,524
who am I?
Because nobody's giving me any 

518
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:44,260
reflective sense of who I am and almost 
vomiting on the bees.

519
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,160
Genuinely.
I was almost sad because,

520
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,480
oh,
the concept of who I was just evaporated

521
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:54,410
and I was scared that she stole all the 
hairs on the end of I thought,

522
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,360
who am I?

523
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,850
And then other people provide your 
parameters if there's no feedback,

524
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,410
no bounce back.
Who are you?

525
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,244
I just had the image Ed of light that 
the self being like a radiator radiant 

526
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,490
radiate in our energy in imagery,
and if that secret,

527
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,590
no,
never gets bounced back.

528
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,060
It's limitless.
It's infinite.

529
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,510
Once I met this man in America is a 
cowboy.

530
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,960
I think it was around the Co.
Yeah,

531
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,690
and he said once there's only so much 
horizon a man can stand either.

532
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,533
If there's just endless horizon,
it's going on forever and no one's 

533
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,900
telling You who you are and you start to
think as you were saying,

534
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,850
how am I?
So what happens next?

535
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,880
Okay,
so now I did.

536
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,130
I'd love to say that the penny dropped 
on the island,

537
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,930
but it didn't at all.
It was afterwards.

538
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:39,230
But for you going from extreme anguish,
then someone's on that island.

539
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,130
It was,
it was a knife edge of,

540
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,103
of.
I was so filming a project for the 

541
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,050
discovery channel.
It was,

542
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,920
I was also going through this sort of 
isolation,

543
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,183
um,
well,

544
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,200
extreme effects of being put in sort of 
solitary confinement.

545
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,690
Solitary confinement is a punishment in 
a prison for a reason.

546
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,621
Well,
okay.

547
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,640
Again,
long story short,

548
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,683
I came off the island,
didn't have any sort of decompression 

549
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,070
therapy or anything like that.
And then about a year later was meant to

550
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,040
be filming another series for,
for discovery.

551
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,750
And I couldn't get out of bed.
I was crying.

552
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:09,584
I was,
um,

553
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,540
my,
my courage.

554
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,850
It was through the floor.
And um,

555
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,940
again,
long story short,

556
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,660
but I went into therapy and I,
I,

557
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,010
I found out because he invariably,
when you do go through therapy,

558
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,020
get this sort of terminology for certain
things and what I,

559
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,680
the way I've lived my life they term as 
a reflected sense of self.

560
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,470
But what they tried to engender with 
emea was my own sense of self.

561
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:33,620
So united.
So you okay.

562
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm not the concept of there being a 
horizon being you can only take so merge

563
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:42,500
and again,
the isolation being so enormous.

564
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,710
It's only because I was,
I was,

565
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,713
I could only feel comfortable when I was
getting reflected sensitive self if you 

566
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:52,070
have sense of self is coming from the 
inside.

567
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:52,904
Because for example,
I had just started developing a moral 

568
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:55,964
compass,
you know,

569
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,150
if I was to steal your pen and walk out 
today,

570
00:25:59,151 --> 00:25:59,984
it's not a big thing but I wouldn't do 
it anymore because it won't feel good 

571
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,120
about myself.
But it doesn't matter whether you're new

572
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:05,954
or whether like I don't.
I now live my life in a really honest 

573
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:09,284
way.
And I think having to strip it back and 

574
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:11,714
work out,
work out who I was was about what I 

575
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:15,890
stand for as well.

576
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,280
So I won't steal off you and I won't 
cheat and I won't lie.

577
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,583
And I think that's the only true way to 
actually really know who you are as a 

578
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:25,820
person.
It doesn't matter what anyone else knows

579
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,950
or understands or can find out or 
anything like that.

580
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,840
And I now go,
okay,

581
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:33,950
I can sit here knowing who I am,
knowing that I've now emotionally mature

582
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:37,970
enough to I have a wife and have a kid 
and stuff like that because I know who I

583
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,804
am.
Whereas if it was all based on how I 

584
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,940
think I'm coming across to,
that becomes extraordinarily complicated

585
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:45,774
very quickly.
And I was in this chap and I would 

586
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,810
honestly say that I walked the amazon so
that other people would say to me,

587
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,640
mate,
your fucking incredibly tough,

588
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,410
tough because they told me I would

589
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,370
investment in a way it's bonkers.
And so many people do live their life in

590
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,290
that way.
And it's just like,

591
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,160
you know,
coming from that true sense of self,

592
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,100
it really,
you really have to dig down deep to find

593
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:09,900
out who you are and what you do stand 
for.

594
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,190
I think there's a thing that.
Yeah,

595
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,024
you're right.
I think there's a thing called 

596
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,710
codependency,
you know,

597
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:14,544
like in 12 step circles,
meaning that your identity is a meshed 

598
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,960
with other people's identity and 
perception of you.

599
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,803
Now.
That thing you just described of like 

600
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,140
needing the feedback and approval of 
others.

601
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,860
I feel like we have a culture that's 
fueled on that,

602
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,540
that everyone's running on.
Who am I?

603
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,320
What do I want?
Oh,

604
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,850
I am my phone,
I am my shoes,

605
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,990
I am my job.
I am not.

606
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:36,570
My wife thinks of me.
I'm just describing myself now.

607
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,403
For me,
my journey has been about having like 

608
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,710
becoming an addict and haven't let go of
drugs.

609
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:43,500
I was addicted to then behaviors that I 
was addicted to them.

610
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,970
Ways of treating people that,
you know,

611
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:47,430
all these things have had to be sort of 
slowly let go of.

612
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,610
What you realize is those things are 
doing a job for you.

613
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,710
They're holding you together.
So what?

614
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:56,700
I'm fascinated in the way that you have 
physicalized and extreme eyes,

615
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,310
if that's a word,
like I like those,

616
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,950
that principle by,
you know,

617
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,793
like what say data.
Like you're saying the whole of the 

618
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:05,970
island experience was.
Didn't bring about tiffany.

619
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,850
You came back from the island and sort 
of had a mental breakdown.

620
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,483
Yeah,
I mean,

621
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,760
crikey.
I think being kind to myself,

622
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,750
I would have had to be pretty superhuman
person to do all of that self evaluation

623
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,584
and come to those sort of aha moments 
and film program for discovery channel 

624
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:24,980
and find food and water and all the 
other things.

625
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,280
There was only so much I could do.
I mean it opened a can of worms,

626
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,563
but I didn't manage.
I didn't manage to come to any sort of 

627
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,794
massive life conclusions.
I think I'm certainly not critical if 

628
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,400
you decide if you made a real mess of 
that time.

629
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,430
Yeah.
But I mean,

630
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,350
it's weird,
isn't it again,

631
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:43,184
because people who said to me,
you know that Ireland was conducive to 

632
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,840
you being able to survive.
There was no better mistakes.

633
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,700
Food,
we've plentiful because you had coconuts

634
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:50,534
and stuff.
Why did you make such a meal of it and 

635
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:55,330
yet you've clearly never been isolated,
have you?

636
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,320
And cranky some people manage it really 
well.

637
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,154
You know,
there's ocean rowers who go longer than 

638
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,450
I spent on the island and have absolute,
you know,

639
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,710
problem is with falling apart.
It must

640
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,620
be very strongly connected to purpose 
and direction.

641
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,483
I reckon the only way,
luckily since obviously purely 

642
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:14,920
speculative in my sense in except for 
this yet another micro example once I to

643
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:15,754
do this stunt where it's a full 
backwards off of a 30 foot feeling into 

644
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:19,900
some crash mats.
Right.

645
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:20,734
And I was so scared of doing it that the
only way I could persuade myself to do 

646
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:27,130
it was by focusing on the small details 
of put your foot there.

647
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,023
Then put there and do tell him exactly 
what the stunt man told me in that 

648
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:34,970
moment with my religion,
like I do these things and that way that

649
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:38,410
the fear could be navigated by the 
coordinates of instruction.

650
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:40,540
I've been offered.
So on that island,

651
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,700
the way you what?
What were you like?

652
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,593
I was thinking possibly the fact that 
you act to find food and keep yourself 

653
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,510
alive would have been in a sense,
structuring the experience,

654
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,220
giving you st hold onto.
In fact.

655
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,223
Yeah,
I think you're absolutely bang on and 

656
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,690
actually that's I think the,
what I wear,

657
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,560
what I came to thInk afterwards is that 
because I didn't have a,

658
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,980
a lateral g,
you know,

659
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,850
journey from a to b,
there wasn't anything to strive for.

660
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,684
It was literally your plankton and 
Ireland and you've got to with yourself 

661
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:10,300
and there is nobody,
there is no time pressure.

662
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,200
There is,
you know,

663
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,350
the no desperation to get food because 
it's all around you.

664
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:15,940
And so.
And that was part of the problem.

665
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,850
It was just like,
this isn't about achieving anything.

666
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,760
This is about you just becoming 
comfortable with yourself.

667
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,670
Can I ask you candidly what coping 
mechanisms city developed?

668
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,700
BecauSe I know that like for me it'd be,
that'd be,

669
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,553
that'd be obsessive about food.
I think masturbation would become an 

670
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,154
issue.
I think I would find things that were 

671
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:34,610
like controlling my states of mind.
Were there things,

672
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,860
because you said he vomited.
I mean,

673
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:38,290
that was obviously very physicalized did
things like.

674
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,450
I know it's a very plain and roots 
question,

675
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,940
so I saw on ebay masturbation,
but one of the things he did,

676
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,774
things like that become that,
or at least I can tell you that or did 

677
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,080
that quickly become quite redundant?

678
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,670
Well,
let's tackle that one first.

679
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,123
No,
see the one that interests me and I 

680
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:53,164
didn't.
I didn't masturbate once in the ocean 

681
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,810
and so it didn't occur to me one.
I think when you're malnourished,

682
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,550
your testosterone goes down.
You aren't thinking in that way.

683
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:10,970
I don't know whether it's something to 
do with times of famine.

684
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,913
People weren't procreating because there
wasn't enough food around so that it 

685
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:16,630
doesn't affect your libido.
Definitely.

686
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,640
Although it would've been a good 
distraction.

687
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,960
You're roy.
I just,

688
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,410
I kind of put it out of my brain as 
well.

689
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:23,280
I don't know why,
but I,

690
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,630
you know,
you can imagine this.

691
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,750
I remember.
Okay.

692
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,090
Studying for my a levels,
for example,

693
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,350
I would have done quite a lot and you 
can eat it.

694
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,510
You feel grabby,
don't you?

695
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:37,020
Have yOu been doing that all the time?
I didn't really want that to be the,

696
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,140
uh,
the focus of my,

697
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,420
of my paradise,
a man alone

698
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,423
with god now type for a while,
those coconuts together and this 

699
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,390
seashell here

700
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,433
I do,
you know what I did because I was so 

701
00:31:56,301 --> 00:32:00,020
scared of spending time on my own and 
spending time with myself.

702
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,220
I again,
this,

703
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,870
this is a really crude way of doing it,
very involved or uninvolved,

704
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,500
but I wouldn't do It today,
but I made my self so busy that I didn't

705
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,690
have time to sit with myself.
So for example,

706
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:15,780
I decided I'd build a shelter and I'd 
literally say,

707
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:16,141
well,
okay,

708
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,940
I could get up in the morning and I make
myself a little cup of tea of on,

709
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,203
but I'm going to get,
allow 15 minutes for that and then I'm 

710
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,134
going to go to work and I'm going to 
spend two hours at work and then at mid 

711
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,870
morning on a comeback and I have a 
tiebreaker and I literally scheduled out

712
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,270
the day.
so I didn't have any time.

713
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:31,104
And reflectively.
I've definitely think that's because I 

714
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:34,794
was so scared of those times when I was 
just reflecting when I was just sitting 

715
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,390
with myself.
So I,

716
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,330
I kept myself extraordinarily busy

717
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,600
to get around that.
So you want your survival technique,

718
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,780
it mentally busy.
What happened?

719
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,741
Yeah.
Excuse me.

720
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,920
When you did find yourself alone,
what is the,

721
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,500
what was the quality of the fear?
What the,

722
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,790
uh,
the fear in the light,

723
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:56,391
you know,
what did you think?

724
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,830
Oh,
I'm not a good enough person.

725
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,960
I made mistakes when I was a kid.
I hate that.

726
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:00,794
I hate most of what was sort of,
what were the frightening things that 

727
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,830
happened in your mind?

728
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,610
Okay.
Again,

729
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:11,210
this is far from a sub story too,
and everybody's got their own story.

730
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,420
Everyone's got stuff that gives some 
issues.

731
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,080
last year with a knife and familiar was 
adoption.

732
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,680
Um,
I was a kid and um,

733
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,870
I didn't understand this for many years 
and I got up to buy very,

734
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,403
very loving middle class family.
I got sent to a good school and I have 

735
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,210
no,
this is not a sob story to however,

736
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,000
there's a theory that,
um,

737
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,380
why do you think you have to keep saying
it's not a sob story?

738
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,173
Because I'm not as.
I don't want to maple sympathy and 

739
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,110
that's not what I'm telling him.
I'm telling it because it's,

740
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,950
I think because it's um,
it doesn't,

741
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,110
it kind of all doesn't make sense unless
you go,

742
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:47,711
well,
hang on.

743
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:49,240
Why?
Why were you insecure?

744
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:50,074
Why did you need to prove these things?
and personally I think that came from 

745
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:52,840
adoption.

746
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,330
Does it?
Uh,

747
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,690
can you explain it quite briefly in the 
photos?

748
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,180
It is a theory that a baby,
when it's born to move the,

749
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,103
the biggest trauma it could possibly 
experience did the equivalent of death 

750
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:05,744
is being separated from his mother 
because it can't feed itself and it 

751
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:10,160
can't do anything to separate those two 
things.

752
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,340
On a very,
very core level,

753
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,563
you are experienced the trauma of death 
and then your whole life Builds upon 

754
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:18,704
that,
that insecurity of being abandoned 

755
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,074
essentially.
So I had huge abandonment issues and 

756
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:25,550
that would spill out and all sorts of 
different ways,

757
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,490
um,
school and you know,

758
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,360
getting expelled for minor acts of 
vandalism to in my twenties,

759
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,650
in the military,
you know,

760
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,920
drinking and getting into trouble with 
plays and bits and bobs like that.

761
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,060
And I,
I just think of course every man's got,

762
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,973
you know,
testosterone and every young man spills 

763
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,360
over and gets into trouble and I think 
that just shows spirit.

764
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,580
But for me,
the deeper insecurity,

765
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:49,414
the reason I needed to go to the amazon,
the reason I needed to do something so 

766
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:56,140
big is because my insecurity was,
was so deep.

767
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,480
I suppose I just genuinely,
you know,

768
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,943
again,
the whole concept of not really knowing 

769
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:03,010
who you are and not knowing what you 
stand for.

770
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,960
I'd do anything for me,
it's dare me to do anything.

771
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,290
I literally do anything.
There was no boundaries and you know,

772
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,100
people are,
you know,

773
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,040
everyone knows people like that.
There's just like,

774
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,920
they're scary because they will do 
anything.

775
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,390
Absolutely.
Anything new.

776
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,300
I definitely fell into that category.
Sends you understand things like this.

777
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:21,850
And the reason I think I say it's not a 
sob stories,

778
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:23,830
because once you understand your 
history,

779
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,083
it doesn't matter anymore,
it's just a chapter in your life and I 

780
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:29,794
wouldn't actually trade and any of that 
for all the money in the world because 

781
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,803
it's made me who I am today and I 
wouldn't have achieved what I've 

782
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,534
achieved in life,
probably if it stayed in the same phone 

783
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,950
and been brought up in a very 
conventional way.

784
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,440
So I'm really,
and let's face it,

785
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:45,274
it'd be a waste of energy to be anything
other than happy with everything that's 

786
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,780
happened to us because it's happened,
you know,

787
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,420
but,
but therefore it's just a chapter in the

788
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:53,254
book.

789
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,110
It was probably a good book.
It's a,

790
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,970
it became,
it became your gift.

791
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,670
The wound became your gift,
the damage,

792
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,410
the damage of like,
as you said it using your words to read.

793
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,220
The worst thing that could have happened
to baby.

794
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,140
It can be separated from the mother that
happened to you.

795
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,500
And curiously,
your life's agenda becomes,

796
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,100
can I survive alone?
That's the question naked on island.

797
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,620
I don't think there's any doubt that was
some sort of,

798
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:26,010
um,
self so,

799
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,480
so fulfilled prophecy.
I,

800
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,750
yeah.

801
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,570
Luck and attempt to resolve the issue,
the drama of your personal metaphors.

802
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,960
You are,
I am abandoned.

803
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:34,794
Well,
if I'm abandoned I need to survive 

804
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:36,940
alone.
Can I.

805
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,403
And then to do that in front of however 
many $95 million people on discovery 

806
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:42,730
channel as well.
I don't know.

807
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,760
It was so deep that I somehow needed 
this is sometimes,

808
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:47,610
which I haven't really quite got to the 
bottom of this way.

809
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,270
I need to do these things publicly as 
well.

810
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Anything,
you know,

811
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,713
I,
I fully understand that famous and it's 

812
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,420
a folly quite frankly and you know,
and uh,

813
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
and not a purpose within it within 
itself.

814
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,540
And yeah,
it's amazing.

815
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,980
I did want to do it on a stage,
you know,

816
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,791
I want,
I want to be.

817
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,970
Would you be able to see it as well?
It wasn't just an intern.

818
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,191
Right.
That's true.

819
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,820
I suppose a person who's got the skills 
to survive and survive,

820
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:11,654
but if you interesting that you raised 
the point that it was about community 

821
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,553
and about connection and about possibly 
about exhibition or demonstration and I 

822
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:24,710
mean in a way perhaps all of us have the
same sort of need to be loved.

823
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,573
This needs to be connected and certainly
all of us have the need to somehow 

824
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:33,960
resolve the drama of our circumstance.
That drama of our childhood.

825
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,620
Like I must become this,
I must solve there.

826
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,080
She does a another again,
it's a therapy sort of,

827
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:41,600
um,
okay terminology.

828
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,434
But,
um,

829
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,983
does this include developmental 
immaturity where you don't self parent 

830
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,404
yourself?
And I definitely think I fell into that 

831
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:50,160
category so I would,
you know,

832
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,093
drive my car at absolute maximum speed 
down the motorway because there was no 

833
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,710
version of myself kicking in and we all 
have different parts of our personality.

834
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:59,050
But the adult version of myself wouldn't
kick in again.

835
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,330
And this is not a terribly good idea.
Or you know,

836
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:05,210
when you've had however many pints in a 
lot of people would go to,

837
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,290
you know,
I've had enough.

838
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,730
Now.
I'm going to go to bed and go home,

839
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,000
whereas that and that never kicked into 
me.

840
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,863
And,
and apparently there is a psychological 

841
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,480
term for it,
which is,

842
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,550
yeah,
and it's not far off from codependency,

843
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:17,384
but you know,
it's the same sort of thing which is 

844
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:22,460
literally just living in this childlike 
state thinking that,

845
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,500
you know,
you can still be abandoned thinking that

846
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,334
you need to almost be so volatile that 
no one can ever reject you because you 

847
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:29,810
are rejecting them or by your outrageous
behavior,

848
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,260
you know.

849
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,470
And um,
I think the thing that has enabled me in

850
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:35,304
recent years because I got married two 
years ago and her little baby about six 

851
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:38,374
months ago and I have no worries that 
I'm going to be a great dad and a great 

852
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:41,861
father.
You know,

853
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,000
I just don't.
I am,

854
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,953
I'm,
I'm doing that at the moment and don't 

855
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,910
doubt myself.
But that's,

856
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,043
I think,
because I've come through this whole 

857
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:48,604
journey because I genuinely,
I meditate every day and part of my 

858
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,240
meditation is,
is literally,

859
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,333
it's called self parenting,
but it's literally holding my own hand 

860
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,770
through life really rather than 
neglecting the,

861
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,090
you know,
how most people go,

862
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,960
like british people especially,
they're like self love is quite a cringy

863
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:08,900
term isn't it?
You know,

864
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,770
americans might say a lot,
but british people,

865
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,360
they don't want to talk about self love,
you know,

866
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,194
they take the piss out of themselves,
they're far more comfortable putting 

867
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,924
themselves down or taking the piss out 
of themselves and they are loving 

868
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,284
themselves and I've had to do it and it 
sort of visualization when I meditate 

869
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,330
each day and it's just like looking 
after myself,

870
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,470
being kind to myself.

871
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,560
And that then enables me to stand and 
they'll go,

872
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:30,640
rIght,
I've got my values,

873
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:34,690
I'm looking after myself and then I can 
genuinely in life go look,

874
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,490
I'm not lying to an or not harming 
anyone.

875
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,540
I mean a really good position to,
you know,

876
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:42,010
he loved my wife and look after my child
and that sort of stuff.

877
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,090
When did you start the meditation again?
It was a therapy thing.

878
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:46,924
I mean,
I was offered whatever the medication 

879
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,470
was at the time,
I can't remember,

880
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,750
but at what point your life is by the 
way as well.

881
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,593
And I couldn't continue filming for 
discovery channel because I had 

882
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,413
essentially a mini breakdown,
but a year after coming off the island 

883
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,230
for 60 days,
done the island,

884
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:04,570
the islands of success.
You come back and then when you get back

885
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,110
to normal domestic life,
everything's sort of hits you.

886
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,320
What was that experienced?
What was happening in your mind and life

887
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,223
then?

888
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,260
I was in at the time a really,
really bad relationship.

889
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,370
So the,
um,

890
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,223
you know,
the first call mode at the end of the 

891
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,590
Ireland experience was to my,
at the time,

892
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,813
um,
girlfriend and we had an argument and I 

893
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,124
was just like,
I can't believe that she's having a go 

894
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:33,361
at me 60 days.
And so that relationship,

895
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,120
I don't know,
it was,

896
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,450
um,
it was,

897
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,690
it was absolutely notes.
I came back and um,

898
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,890
I think with hindsight,
you know,

899
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:45,724
tv is,
it's a scary thing that you go to 

900
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,240
discovery channel,
you go,

901
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm going to put myself under the item 
for 60 days.

902
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,091
And they said,
well,

903
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:54,190
could you survive like no knife?
Nothing.

904
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,270
And I was like,
I don't know.

905
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:56,140
And they go,
brilliant,

906
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:56,974
let's do it.
Because they want to embrace it from a 

907
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,913
televisual perspective.
They want to make entertainment for 

908
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:02,014
people.
And if I struggled that would be really 

909
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:03,754
entertaining.

910
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,280
Nobody really went,
yeah,

911
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,540
but is this going to do any damage?
You know,

912
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,200
psychologically,
certainly let alone the sort of physical

913
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:15,520
thing or that thing.
Why dId you choose six days on an island

914
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,413
alone?
Because I think I was forever sort of 

915
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:22,894
gravitating towards an experience where 
I really genuinely had to know that I 

916
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,430
could look after myself.
I think it wasn't abandoned that thing.

917
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:31,990
I think it was me needing to know that I
was capable of,

918
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,590
of,
of survIving on their own.

919
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,700
and I don't think that's the end state 
in life.

920
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:37,534
You know,
everyone can be as independent and as 

921
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:41,770
they like and have as many survival 
skills as ray mears,

922
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,643
but that's not,
it doesn't make you a happy person does 

923
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:45,830
it?
I mean,

924
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,663
I just needed to come through to the 
state where I was confident enough in 

925
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:50,850
myself as a person too.
Then,

926
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:52,120
you know,
open my heart and,

927
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,060
and,
and embrace the people around me.

928
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,040
But I think I need to do one first.
If you know,

929
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,280
she got back and you'd have a sort of 
mental breakdown and you're like,

930
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,930
you have this argument with your then 
partner for africans.

931
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,320
That relationship breaks up and you're 
alone

932
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,090
longer than that.
But um,

933
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,223
I enjoy it.
That you liked being alone would be odd 

934
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:15,930
for you after you've done 60 days on an 
island to think that you're alone.

935
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,783
Proof.

936
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,200
I know people and you know,
I really,

937
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,093
you know,
the best times in life have always been 

938
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:26,120
shared moments they've never been.
When I'm completely on my own,

939
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,700
I don't think I can pick a moment when 
I've.

940
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,173
Okay.
Sometimes if we're on a run or 

941
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,320
something,
but even that isn't.

942
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,320
I'm going to have your endorphins are 
going through your mind,

943
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,154
but it's in a certain parameters whereby
you know you're going to come home and 

944
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,630
again,
the people that you love and it.

945
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,464
But I think in general you choose to do 
the big moments of your life with the 

946
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:48,874
people that you love.
Wouldn't you choose to spend millennium 

947
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,980
christmas,
new year's eve with you know,

948
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:56,110
your best mates or whatever,
and I think that's what life's about for

949
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:56,831
me.
Family,

950
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:57,910
friends,
that sort of stuff.

951
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,970
But you've got to get yourself right 
first

952
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,550
to have a meaningful input to their 
family and friends.

953
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,384
I think my book about 12 steps and the 
12 steps themselves from which the book 

954
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,530
is derived.
It's about how you go on a journey to be

955
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:13,364
able to be part of a community by 
addressing these issues without going 

956
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,243
around Ireland for 60 days.
But by going in yourself and knowing 

957
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:23,634
that you're probably being motivated by 
things that you don't understand and 

958
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:27,324
that's why you have to drink and that's 
why you have to take drugs and that's 

959
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:29,544
why you have to gamble.
Or that's why you're shopping too much 

960
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:32,310
or that's why you're in bad 
relationships,

961
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:35,100
so that's why you're doing your job.
You don't like because you've never ever

962
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,143
asked yourself the question.
You've never stopped and done something 

963
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:40,860
as transformative or ritualistic as 
being alone.

964
00:43:40,861 --> 00:43:43,830
I mean like the idea of isolation.
It's a religious idea,

965
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,900
isn't it?
That in a monastic cultures,

966
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:48,770
and I bet in them aboriginal cultures 
that were they able to go?

967
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,010
Yeah,
we did sound a bit like that.

968
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:50,844
Anyway.
We're a 15 year old boys sloughing off 

969
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,400
and talked to survive.

970
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,491
They do,
don't they?

971
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:55,324
They go walkabout and you know,
one of the absolute aboriginal 

972
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,583
traditions is,
is to go off as a young man on your own 

973
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:05,540
and spend extended periods of time in 
the bush on your own and you know,

974
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,930
that is a part of how they evolve into a
man.

975
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:12,290
And I think that's no coincidence.
So either I think,

976
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,220
you know,
for me,

977
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,400
I didn't need to sit there without any 
of the distractions.

978
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,463
Addictions are not anything in life that
distracts you from just being able to 

979
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:23,140
sit with yourself.
And I think it's hugely important.

980
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,760
If you don't quite know who you are,
if you've always like,

981
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,793
people are so busy at work for example,
and then they come home and because 

982
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:31,920
there is that time,
in theory,

983
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,600
my brain gets switched off now,
but that will be.

984
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,390
Or I could stop thinking about stuff,
but that would be a bit scary.

985
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,010
They'll have a glass of wine and it's 
just,

986
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,030
I need either to be stupidly busy or to 
numb my brain,

987
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,370
but the other bit,
you know,

988
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,990
that actually just sitting in

989
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,330
and feeling how I'm genuinely feeling.
That'S the scary bit.

990
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,193
Holding reality being in reality.
So who was it that during this time of 

991
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:57,260
crisis suggested meditation to you and 
how did you get into that?

992
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,123
It was,
um,

993
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,160
it was a neuro linguistic programming 
lady who was operating in called malecon

994
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,260
who operated from a little little clinic
in knightsbridge I think at the time.

995
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,153
And um,
I didn't really get on with the neuro 

996
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,480
linguistic programming,
but she goes,

997
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:14,961
look,
this,

998
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,150
this app is for cynics,
you know,

999
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,310
and it's just a,
it's called headspace.

1000
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:22,220
Went by a guy who,
who used to come from bristol a thing.

1001
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:24,170
And he's a sports science guy,
but he,

1002
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,240
he had dodgy part of his life and he 
went off and became a,

1003
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,610
um,
of buddhist monk and spent a huge amount

1004
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:35,810
of his time actually studying meditation
and I think it has,

1005
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,180
I mean hezbollah has earned him millions
now.

1006
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:39,350
It's,
it's big in New York.

1007
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:39,831
It's,
it's,

1008
00:45:39,831 --> 00:45:42,290
it's as big a lot of countries all over 
the world,

1009
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,113
but it's,
it's the meditation without the justice 

1010
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:46,520
and the,
you know,

1011
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,160
the chanting and singing had an.

1012
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:54,450
And I needed it to be accessible at that
stage because if We rewind a few years I

1013
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:56,234
was,
I was very ex military and so I would 

1014
00:45:57,251 --> 00:46:00,830
have taken the mickey out of people who 
told me that I'd be meditating daily,

1015
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,740
you know,
now for 10 years ago I would have gone.

1016
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,600
That's just ridiculous.
I just have a pint,

1017
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,010
you know,
do believe in god.

1018
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,350
I don't reAlly like the sort of 
religious structure put around.

1019
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,040
I believe in something bigger than me.
Then I suppose the,

1020
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,220
my,
my belief is the,

1021
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,223
the closest to it.
I think that I can describe it as the 

1022
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:23,510
guy or principle,
you know,

1023
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,344
the concept of the earth acting like a 
living organism and therefore there is 

1024
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:28,334
something positive happening that's 
bigger than me that is taking things on 

1025
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:31,814
a,
on a positive journey that has an 

1026
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:37,961
interest in things going well and people
functioning together and operating as a,

1027
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,250
as an,
as a cohesIve unit.

1028
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:45,251
And I think for me that's not religion.
I think it's quite a crude way of people

1029
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:46,154
trying to use the smallest brain,
the logical brain to actually put sort 

1030
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,170
of parameters on something that you 
can't really talk about.

1031
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:52,950
But it,
it's,

1032
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,120
I believe in something bigger than him.

1033
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,200
There is some sort of harmonious 
connection that these aboriginal mentors

1034
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:01,170
and tutors that you found and made use 
of.

1035
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,360
What is your understanding of what their
spirituality is based on?

1036
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,271
Well,
very similar.

1037
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,650
I mean it's the universe.
It's,

1038
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,750
um,
I mean they believe that their ancestors

1039
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:11,584
are still around,
which I think sometimes the way it was 

1040
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:15,004
described to me is that your,
if your life is like if you were a jug 

1041
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:23,310
of water and you put it in one drop of 
water falls out of the jug of water back

1042
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,110
into another job at the bottom,
your life,

1043
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,710
you feel like you're an individual 
entity while you're that drop of water,

1044
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,130
but you're just coming from,

1045
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,650
uh,
the,

1046
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:36,470
the sort of a source and you're going 
straight by two and,

1047
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,920
and,
and I think that's how they feel.

1048
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,783
I mean,
I certainly know that jeremy and my 

1049
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,100
aboriginal friends,
they,

1050
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,503
they,
they talk about communicating with the 

1051
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,080
ancestors and they,
they,

1052
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:48,430
um,
and they,

1053
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,610
they walk in,
they have a foot in,

1054
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,950
in more than one world.
And um,

1055
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,710
and I think they believe in the 
universe.

1056
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:59,350
I think they believe in the positive 
forces of the planet.

1057
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,403
They don't over complicate it.
I think that that's because they don't 

1058
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:04,060
make it cerebral.
Don't use that.

1059
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,440
What's that tangled mind called again?
It nando nando parrado.

1060
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,000
There's a word of the day.
I'm like,

1061
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,253
yeah,
we have a culture that lives in Peru 

1062
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,930
minds here.
Since you've learned all these skills,

1063
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,490
does go in and being isolated or 
comparable survival programs.

1064
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:22,324
I don't know.
Obviously you continue to make these 

1065
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:23,704
very successful programs at these as 
important as any other bit of kit or a 

1066
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:28,414
purse orange personal ability to 
physically ensure these knowledge of 

1067
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,530
spirit and mind.

1068
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:38,230
It's the most powerful to be able to.
I've got as as I would have.

1069
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,990
I used to say the mind,
but it's not,

1070
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:41,710
isn't it?
It's it.

1071
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,690
It's greater than that.
It is the ability to control my state.

1072
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,533
I think.
Wow.

1073
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:45,901
You know,
I've,

1074
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:46,734
I've definitely spent days and days and 
days running around like a headless 

1075
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:51,610
chicken in survival situations,
making a meal of things,

1076
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,283
but the time when you stop and compose 
yourself and meditate that that's when 

1077
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:56,824
it starts going well.
So this is one thing thAt people that 

1078
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:00,484
are not surviving in extreme conditions 
can learn because we are all surviving 

1079
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,613
on the,
on the mountains and terrains and 

1080
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:10,120
tundras of the inner space of the inner 
life.

1081
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:15,121
And we have to find a way of reflecting 
somehow finding an inner tree,

1082
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,300
an inner connection where we can find 
repos and like,

1083
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:21,070
you know,
I agree with what you've said about sort

1084
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:24,640
of conventional religion that I believe 
a lot of people get to access,

1085
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:25,474
get to contact,
get to connection through conventional 

1086
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:28,084
religion.

1087
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,373
But I believe that unless we have this 
point of my struggle in my own life is 

1088
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,874
being able to find a point of access 
like that and len maintain it because I 

1089
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:41,080
get distracted away from it if I get 
frightened or if I get full of desire,

1090
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,300
like it very hard to keep the 
connection.

1091
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,373
So I suppose it's fascinating when 
someone distills it as you have done 

1092
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,650
into obvious.
Certainly not obvious.

1093
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:54,880
I'm sort of modern.
I wanna say epic survival conditions,

1094
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:57,370
you know,
if I can survive in this extreme.

1095
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,353
Why?
I mean it's a slightly comical setting 

1096
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,570
really.
I mean,

1097
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,650
I'm not in a survival situation,
I'm being dropped off by a tv crew in an

1098
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,500
area where they know there's gonna be 
some water and there's going to be,

1099
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,820
and you're making an entertaining show 
and the parameters are survival.

1100
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,654
Yes,
I've got a lot of fire without matches 

1101
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:15,790
or a lighter,
yes,

1102
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:16,624
I've got to find food,
but it is essentially a little snapshot 

1103
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,900
of life.
It's just life into glorious technicolor

1104
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,734
and the fact that you have,
you've got to do all of those 

1105
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,054
components,
but I'm still stressed about will I get 

1106
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:28,050
the right footage to make the program 
run

1107
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,800
by worrying about whether I'm going to 
pay next month's mortgage.

1108
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,790
You know,
all the normal stuff was still there.

1109
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,010
And therefore I think with the added 
component of,

1110
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:37,943
because obviously directing film,
everything myself with that component 

1111
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,680
and surviving,
it's huge control freak,

1112
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,880
a massive control freak.
I certainly have been,

1113
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:48,470
but um,
but I think,

1114
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,630
I think yeah,
therefore meditation's really necessary.

1115
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,870
otherwise I'd just tie myself in knots 
all the time and it would all become too

1116
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,883
overwhelming.
Would you be able to do the sustained 

1117
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:02,141
periods of isolation or even separation 
now that you are a father and husband?

1118
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,620
I've got a new show started filming in 
january,

1119
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:10,940
so I'm going to have to do mate that's 
actually got a another show,

1120
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,400
which I think they're going to 
commission.

1121
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,283
I'm not sure.
I'm not Allowed to say it involves my 

1122
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,330
family involved In both of them 
actually,

1123
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,370
which could be very.
That is amazing.

1124
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,204
I really hope that gets made because one
of the things I think my fantasies 

1125
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:27,170
version of this is it must be so amazing
to know that it's society falls apart on

1126
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,830
sometimes it feels like it might or even
the issue that you'd be out guy,

1127
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:31,664
right?
It's okay,

1128
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:32,990
we're going here,
we're going to do this,

1129
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,410
this,
this,

1130
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,730
and that.
Must be amazing.

1131
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,541
Yeah.
No,

1132
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,310
I actually quite,
um,

1133
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,010
I get,
I could do gain a little confidence that

1134
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:41,990
I have known that confidence of being 
able to go into the word,

1135
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,420
take two bits of work together and be 
able to make a fire.

1136
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,340
That's a cool thIng.
I used to say the mickey.

1137
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,174
So much of sort of geeks who watch star 
trek and make fire by friction and used 

1138
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:51,900
to take the,
yeah,

1139
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,180
take the piss out of them.
But um,

1140
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,080
having gone through that and I'm in an 
mls cynical person now,

1141
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,990
I think it's a really nice wholesome,
organic skill.

1142
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:00,883
So yeah,
It's almost like it would be a lovely 

1143
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:03,230
thing.
I'd love to know that.

1144
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,093
I'd love to be to know that this is what
you need to survive because I feel like 

1145
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,690
possibly the sense of abandoned and 
vulnerability that you described in your

1146
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:12,524
own personal drama.
Most of us know our life is held 

1147
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,220
together by the power of other people 
were like,

1148
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:19,740
you know,
we're,

1149
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,680
we need the house.
We need the clothes.

1150
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,023
We need to say we need the media.
We need to advertise and we need the 

1151
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:25,010
comments.

1152
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,780
We need the banks.
We can't confront the banks.

1153
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:27,614
Bring down the bloody government will be
dead in 10 minutes because there's no 

1154
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,840
one can see in the american survivalist 
movement.

1155
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:33,723
The sheriff that night.
That is a sense of we want to be 

1156
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:35,984
independent.
We want to live tribally wanting to be 

1157
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:40,370
connected to nature in an hour like 
that.

1158
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:41,204
So that's the impetus,
but there's no language to do it and 

1159
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,074
there's no culture to do it.
And there's certainly no way of a 

1160
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,293
correlate in a or conflate in the fact 
that it is a spiritual as well as 

1161
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:57,410
physical endeavor to be able to survive 
in the world.

1162
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,370
Yeah,
I think you hit the nail on the head and

1163
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,213
think that's why my shows are successful
is because people want to vicariously 

1164
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:05,480
live in this world where they don't need
a bank there.

1165
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,150
They don't have to go to the supermarket
in order to buy the food.

1166
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,830
They want to be able to do it for 
themselves.

1167
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:11,420
And yet you're right,
there are no,

1168
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,490
you can't,
you can't achieve that in this world.

1169
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:15,760
You can't go off the grid really.
And the uk is it.

1170
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:16,603
And I mean,
it's incredibly difficult to do so all 

1171
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:20,920
sorts of alternative cultures,
um,

1172
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,780
think that they can survive without 
money.

1173
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:24,800
And certainly in the uk,

1174
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,240
you know,
they can't

1175
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,800
do that.
We're owned.

1176
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,760
And in fact,
you also feel that if you try to do it,

1177
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,000
forces would step in and prevent it.
Well,

1178
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,730
the word,
I mean travel is obviously a looked down

1179
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:38,800
upon and by a huge number of parts of 
society aren't they?

1180
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,620
Because you know,
they're not contributing to the state,

1181
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:41,454
but we've got around culture,
we don't want to do this and making 

1182
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:46,770
their own choices and they don't want to
be a part of the mainstream.

1183
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,950
And I think inherently a lot of people 
have a bit of that in them anyway.

1184
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,093
Those of us that don't have this 
monumental will to survive an ambition 

1185
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,020
that you have expressed and six,
uh,

1186
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,380
and uh,
achieved such success for what do,

1187
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,500
what can we do to access and learn from 
your trials and your journeys?

1188
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,970
What would you suggest?
Even someone like me,

1189
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:12,370
I mean my mate matt,
who's such a fan,

1190
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,710
I'm a great fan of yours.

1191
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,543
You a great hero of his.
He's like staying or like we want to do 

1192
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,074
campaign.
He's going definitely in some suspended 

1193
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,120
10 in a private word in essex this 
weekend,

1194
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,190
friday,
saturday,

1195
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,024
and sunday.
And I'm debating whether or not to go 

1196
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:30,510
with him.
I mentioned it to my wife and she said,

1197
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:31,350
yeah,
you should go.

1198
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,220
You should go to bloody out.
I think like,

1199
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,190
uh,
but like,

1200
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:36,050
uh,
you know,

1201
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,980
like easy that we should say,
right.

1202
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:38,963
Some of my life has got to be like that 
cold plunge in the pond moment where 

1203
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,250
you're hit with the reality of what life
is.

1204
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,740
Would you suggest that sort of thing.
I think.

1205
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,443
I think it's a really good idea to sort 
of structure a bit of that into your 

1206
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:51,840
life.
Whether that's,

1207
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,703
you know,
going,

1208
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,520
walking in the peak district at the 
weekend or wherever it is getting out of

1209
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:56,890
london.

1210
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:59,310
It's really difficult.
I think you can do it in london,

1211
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:00,144
but it's really difficult to step out of
that heady space when you were in 

1212
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:05,574
london.
There's just so much energy with the 

1213
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:07,944
concentration of people,
but it might be a bit like that 

1214
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,240
aboriginal man san shut the fuck up.
It might be like that on him.

1215
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,710
There's times 12 million winning 
mentally.

1216
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,590
Imagine all of the,
all of the energy.

1217
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:19,020
And I hadn't said a word in that car and
yet he,

1218
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,913
he just said,
I just cannot think with all that noise 

1219
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,520
going on in your head a bit.
Bloody jed.

1220
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,320
I bet.
And it is a bit,

1221
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,210
but It was quite cool as well.
It's welcome.

1222
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,293
I think you do.
Most of us need to get out in order to 

1223
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,010
get that clarity of thought or to just 
stop thinking.

1224
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,600
And I think london confuses it or,
or very dense populations do confuse it.

1225
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,490
Yeah.
So make space for yourself in some way,

1226
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:44,550
whether it's sort of like a walk in to 
pick some way of interacting with nature

1227
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,650
in a very,
in a very literal way.

1228
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,840
What about,
what do you thInk of this quote?

1229
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:49,674
I think about it sometimes chesterton 
said to the truly adventurous man would 

1230
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,873
it likes an interest?
And I'm not saying this as a dick with 

1231
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,060
a,
uh,

1232
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,893
you know,
Instead of trekking across planes and 

1233
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:02,670
climbing mountains would simply jump 
over these next door neighbors fence,

1234
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:06,890
meanIng I suppose that adventure is 
potentially all around us and what we're

1235
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,733
bound by in a sense,
he's convention and we all live in 

1236
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,730
restricted space that you think that,
that,

1237
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:13,564
that what you have learned as a literal 
survivalist has had so many are evident 

1238
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:19,620
spiritual connotations and it's driven 
you in the direction of the spirit.

1239
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,753
That there are ways of crossing 
boundaries that these techniques could 

1240
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,980
be applied to the way that we.
Are you curious about the way this could

1241
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:29,830
affect societies,
what you've learned?

1242
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,330
I think for me,
yeah,

1243
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,400
I would agree with that in the fact that
I don't,

1244
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,190
I don't feel that need to go and climb a
mountain or,

1245
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:37,120
or,
um,

1246
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,313
you know,
conquer something that hasn't been 

1247
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:39,814
achieved before as much anymore.
I think everyone needs meaning in their 

1248
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:45,070
life obviously.
and you know,

1249
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,904
from having a baby recently as well,
that suddenly it just changes your 

1250
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,374
perspective on life.
You're not the center of the world 

1251
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,060
anymore.
Something really meaningful that yes,

1252
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,070
okay,
it's a bit of a cliche and everyone says

1253
00:56:57,071 --> 00:56:58,480
that your life changes when you have a 
baby,

1254
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,314
but for me it has all of the stuff that 
I still do and I'm not going to stop 

1255
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,544
going on.
Adventures feels like it has gotten 

1256
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,130
meaning because you know,
again,

1257
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:06,964
there's an analogy that our is like or 
relationship is like ships in the 

1258
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:12,574
harbor.
It's like built in a harbor and it's 

1259
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:14,404
safe in the harbor,
but you don't build a ship to stay in 

1260
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,430
their heart,
but it has to go out and it has to go on

1261
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,323
journeys and it has to come back again 
and I think it's all part and parcel of 

1262
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:22,570
the same thing.

1263
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,440
yes,
it's good to go away and adventures.

1264
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,293
Yes,
it's good to go and have experiences 

1265
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,090
outside of the nucleus of the family,
but invariably you're going to come back

1266
00:57:31,091 --> 00:57:31,924
and it makes going on those journeys or 
the more meaningful because you've got 

1267
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,670
something wholesome and meaningful to 
come back to you.

1268
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,590
I think before that,
that's why it's called relationship.

1269
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,820
You're meant to go on a voyage.
Weren't meant to be a punk,

1270
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,280
but basically was,
wow.

1271
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:49,280
So I think I want to,
I'm going to go and do this campaign.

1272
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,010
We can think what I want to do.
Some,

1273
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,040
learn some surviving things off you will
perhaps.

1274
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,670
What should we.
Do we do it.

1275
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:59,900
Is there some way you can think of 
format in that alternative into anything

1276
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:00,763
like,
I mean,

1277
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,200
not necessarily for television but 
possibly for television,

1278
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,020
but like I just like feel like what 
would you

1279
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,910
eclipse suggest?
It wouldn't be a difficult thing to,

1280
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:13,030
to set up a survival scenario where we 
could go in and teach you if he wants to

1281
00:58:13,401 --> 00:58:14,630
as well.
It will be all over it.

1282
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:18,170
Some survival stuff and then uh,
and then set he to It.

1283
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,023
Um,
whether that's as a two or individually 

1284
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:23,120
on your own If you want to do experience
the isolation,

1285
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:25,610
but as well.
But I really do.

1286
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,650
Yeah,
I'd love to do wow

1287
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,000
asset real good.
Clear.

1288
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,360
And is there anything and just to return
again.

1289
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,313
So it was a simple thing.
People listen to this podcast to learn 

1290
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:37,600
things in a later week here.
And you have been absolutely fantastic.

1291
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,080
I want to do this because then like the 
whole time I'm doing it,

1292
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:44,230
I'm thinking this is all information.
This is amazing information.

1293
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:45,064
I need this information to other.
He's actually actually matt morgan is 

1294
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:53,341
actually outside standing in the 
corridor or looking for a nordic.

1295
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:56,290
Actually come in,
come in,

1296
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,600
come in.
that'd be so silly.

1297
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,000
It's so under the skin.
And listeners,

1298
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:03,250
if you listen to the radio show that I 
also do.

1299
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:06,700
You will have heard of matt morgan.
We're going to wrap up the show soon.

1300
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:07,534
But matt would you.

1301
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,520
He can't even get in the bloody studio.
It's elevated stuff.

1302
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,093
Alright.
So matt morgan and ed's come and share 

1303
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:20,790
my microphone.
I don't when you bought the ring because

1304
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,920
it will.
Yeah,

1305
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:22,913
that's it.
Let's not try and pretend that we're 

1306
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:26,480
cool in front of it.
Now I told you I've already told it that

1307
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,700
we're planning to do that.
Whether you are definitely the campaign.

1308
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,920
the other thing is you're he.
Well one night.

1309
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,480
Yeah.
Well possibly one night.

1310
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,540
Is there any effort like whipping edge 
been absolutely amazing.

1311
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,360
And talking about like last,
this was the,

1312
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,620
would be the podcast I would most 
recommend that you listen to.

1313
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,180
I think you'll,
I think you'll love it.

1314
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:45,223
What,
what sort of trials and what sort of 

1315
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:51,230
techniques and tips would you suggest 
that people listening to this now should

1316
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:53,600
try in our own lives?
That without,

1317
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,500
as I was saying,
being a monument and adventure?

1318
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,040
Well,
I mean for me the thing that's helped me

1319
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,980
and I do use it into over situations 
and,

1320
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,730
and outside is what we've already talked
about,

1321
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,400
but that's meditation and you know,
the app that I spoke about,

1322
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,510
the headspace,
um,

1323
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,583
you know,
use your cultural collateral 10 minutes 

1324
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,333
20 pence with promoting genuinely don't 
start our own ones that every day we're 

1325
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,251
let,
okay,

1326
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:17,084
let's start with taking that time and 
get him as a guest to have some 

1327
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,190
perspective over being wrapped up in 
your own,

1328
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,820
in your own life and being super 
involved in your own little stories.

1329
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:29,913
It's just stepping one step Back and be 
able to have a bit of perspective and 

1330
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,044
clarity.
And that's helped me at home in 

1331
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:37,490
relationship since verbal situations 
that across the board,

1332
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,600
I just imagine it must be a phenomenal 
lesson to know that you can survive,

1333
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:44,660
that you can survive emotionally,
that you can survive spiritually,

1334
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:47,120
that you can survive physically and 
like,

1335
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:49,970
and the importance that you've placed on
the spiritual component of that.

1336
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,580
And I say I wasn't pushing it in that 
direction as being not much.

1337
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,043
It doesn't shut up about that.
Can we talk about stuff that I know 

1338
01:00:58,731 --> 01:01:02,610
something about so I can complete in 
this chat and.

1339
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,180
Yeah.
So I think it's fantastic match.

1340
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,870
You want to ask question and as you're 
here in 87 bivy bags,

1341
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:09,704
right?
Yeah.

1342
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,930
If I'm.
Because I'm going tomorrow.

1343
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,773
Yeah.
Okay.

1344
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,713
is thEre any,
do they keep you any warmer in the tent 

1345
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,670
or is it just like there instead of 
attending in a tent you don't need.

1346
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,570
You don't even know if it's going to 
told you that it was a t.

1347
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:25,040
Skin tent has got an inner and an outer.
Yeah.

1348
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,400
Okay.
But if you want to sleep outside just in

1349
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:30,320
the baby bag,
then that's an option.

1350
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,650
I'd go for like,
um,

1351
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,553
polyester woven,
got full gortex because you could get a 

1352
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,430
bit sweaty and it's getting very real.

1353
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,263
Now,
the last word for eight after all that 

1354
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:44,180
fantastic with said it before,
you get a bit sweaty after talking about

1355
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,360
the true nature of man,
access to the infinite that we are trope

1356
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,603
of war are traveling between jogs.
