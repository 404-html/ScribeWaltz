Welcome Chi.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,610
Hello.
Thanks for having me on.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,373
Really greatly to come on as you know,
like that my motivation for doing these 

12
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,094
podcasts because I'm at.
So as university you've been doing it 

13
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:46,184
degree religion in global politics and 
what I felt like the sort of a 

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,740
dilettante's glee at new information.
And then like when I was sort of getting

15
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,550
given essays and stuff,
I think,

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,770
you know,
the minute I could meet these people,

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,090
I've been on the tele.
So this is part of that is in a way it's

18
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,760
like make a wish foundation just for 
one,

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,250
making one person's wishes come true.
Um,

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,203
so we wanted to start around the area of
empire because a sort of national 

21
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,304
identity,
a ethnocentric national identity in 

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:25,910
particular becoming very prevalent both 
in our country and America.

23
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,163
Wanted to talk to you about colonial 
nostalgia and would you explain what 

24
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:37,241
that term means and what this particular
moment around brexit and trump,

25
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,840
if you've got any analysis on them,
like to kick us off with?

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,920
Yeah,
so I mean the term colonial nostalgia,

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,890
it kind of refers to if you look at the 
public discourse,

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,660
particularly around brexit and the vote 
leave campaign and the idea that Britain

29
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:55,270
is great and Britain can go back to the 
time it was great.

30
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,343
Well the time that Britain was great was
when it was an empire when it rolled 

31
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:04,261
over 25 percent of the world when the 
colonies stretched out to the empire.

32
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,000
The Sun never sets.
And that is the basis of,

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,943
of Britain's wealth today.
And that is kind of what people are 

34
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,294
looking back at.
How do we go back to that colonial 

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,113
prestige of Britain Nebula?
So when we say greatness mean tyranny 

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,900
and oppression effectively.
Yeah.

37
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,734
With this,
this is what we're celebrating and 

38
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:25,960
because we teach empire so badly,
we don't really understand the horror.

39
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,853
I mean,
the British empire was killed more 

40
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,200
people than the Nazis.
Uh,

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,053
it was literally a form of fascism that 
laid waste to whole whole areas of the 

42
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:37,930
world and hope peoples of the world

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,150
quiet if like an institution or nation 
killed more people than the Nazis.

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,933
And the main reason we think the Nazis 
are bad is because they killed so many 

45
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,554
people.
Does that mean the British empire was 

46
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,530
worse than the Nazis?

47
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,561
Yeah,
I mean,

48
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,394
in some ways actually the British empire
and the Nazi's aren't separate in any 

49
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,784
way,
shape or form.

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
There's a book that I'm Bauman 
sociologist called and road where he's 

51
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:05,884
called Holocaust and identity,
and actually argues that how we think 

52
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,800
about the Holocaust.
These though somehow alien,

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,600
it's so outside.
It was so horrible.

54
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,710
It could never possibly fit within our 
wonderful enlightened society.

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,573
But actually in the book he makes the 
argument that the west modality 

56
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,760
capitalism is the only society that 
could have produced the Holocaust.

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,430
And the reason for that is racial 
science.

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,473
When you think about the idea that Jews 
aren't really people and we can prove 

59
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,760
they're not people from measuring in 
food science,

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
what end,
that's race,

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,420
that's the same racism which produced 
slavery.

62
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,160
It says that I'm not fully a person and 
you can treat me like cattle.

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,600
That's the same,
same racism,

64
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,210
the same science that proved that Jews 
were in human.

65
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,270
And also if you think about the,
the amount of death,

66
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,253
that scientific process of death,
there's nothing new about that for the 

67
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,970
Holocaust.
I mean Belgium,

68
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,023
uh,
the killed about 10 million people in 

69
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,910
the Congo slavery wasted.
It was millions and millions of people.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,953
So in a sense the holocaust is like the 
logic of capitalism just don't tell 

71
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,020
people we consider white and so it 
becomes law.

72
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,830
He's horrible.

73
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,490
Right?
Right.

74
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,210
As far as two things,
yes,

75
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,044
of course it was people that were white.
And also I suppose in terms of their 

76
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:19,260
trajectory,
it was a innovative commerce,

77
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,123
civilized country where people live in 
civilized lives and the victims were 

78
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:27,090
civilized.
So in a way,

79
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:29,850
I suppose it reveals a lot about our 
presumptions around race,

80
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:33,150
if you wouldn't even in a modern 
context,

81
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,120
I mean contemporary context.
Consider that was the same.

82
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:36,954
Yeah,
but hold on a minute that it was all 

83
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,810
living in Africa and that it's not as 
bad because I didn't have net cut and.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,310
No,
and that's the problem,

85
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,144
right?
So big you see the logic of the western 

86
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:49,580
imperialism in Europe for white people 
and then you see it,

87
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,414
this is terrible.
But actually if you look the Holocaust 

88
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:52,454
is,
if you think of the Holocaust is being 

89
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:56,480
one of many imperial terrible things 
that happened.

90
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,520
It's really not even in the top 10,
right?

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,440
Right.
Because it is the way that we categorize

92
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,330
this information of like,
you know,

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,193
like,
like as if there's a like a handicap 

94
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,540
system,
apply it.

95
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,420
He's was white people.
So that's the worst.

96
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,070
Then down at like that.
So,

97
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,590
uh,
your obviously right,

98
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:15,360
thanks for illuminating me on that.
Now,

99
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,773
um,
how is that idea progressing and how is 

100
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,510
that perpetuate in the idea of racial 
science and that term?

101
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:27,180
I know from school net crow politics,
how does that,

102
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,220
how is that continuing now?
Where is the,

103
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,083
what's the front line of these arguments
that are at their most evident in the 

104
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:34,620
most evident form of slavery and 
Holocaust?

105
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,540
What's the version of that we're living 
with now?

106
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,583
Yeah.
So after the Holocaust and then people 

107
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:41,280
see like racial science is,
is terrible,

108
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,590
and actually maybe we should move away 
from racial science.

109
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,170
And before the Holocaust he was just 
science.

110
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,240
It wasn't racial science and it wasn't 
controversial.

111
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,074
Correct.
That was just what we all kind of 

112
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,340
agreed.
But when you see that happen,

113
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,310
uh,
to the Jews,

114
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,670
I see that the terror of it in Europe,
we've kind of abandoned race.

115
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,200
So will hear people will say race 
doesn't exist.

116
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,110
Racist,
problematic.

117
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,180
We should move away from the idea of 
race,

118
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,950
uh,
moved to ethnicity.

119
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,330
The problem is the way that we think 
about ethnicity is basically exactly the

120
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,010
same way.
We thought about rates.

121
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,800
So there's different ethnic groups,
but their racialized.

122
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,693
So I'm Caribbean,
but then you lumping Caribbean with 

123
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,320
African on the black,
then you have Asian,

124
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,540
which is India and Pakistan,
et Cetera.

125
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,300
Then you have mixed and even if you look
at the sensors,

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,380
the hierarchy of white to black is 
actually visually represented,

127
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,280
right?
It's white,

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,410
Irish and then he's Asian.
Then it's mixed.

129
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,180
He's black and you see they actually,
the way we talk about ethnicity,

130
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,014
he still says that black people may not 
be inferior because of biology anymore 

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,970
were inferior because of our culture,
because of language,

132
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,890
because of our traditions,
because we haven't got any history.

133
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,103
So it's just a,
it's just a different version of the 

134
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,944
same thing I thought was interesting.
So power you say mew tights but doesn't 

135
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,930
often accede in.
I like,

136
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,591
it's like,
oh,

137
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,930
we can't do it in that way anymore,
but it is a new way.

138
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,681
Yeah,
exactly.

139
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,390
I think about,
if you think about what's,

140
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,260
what's,
what's,

141
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,120
uh,
racism really fundamentally about,

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,820
it's about creating a system that says 
you have Europe,

143
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,683
what are the top,
you have Africa black the button and 

144
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,960
there's various gradations in between.

145
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,170
And that is actually what global 
politics look like today.

146
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,410
It's not a coincidence that the poorest 
countries in the world are in Africa and

147
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,500
the richest countries in the world,
the European West white countries.

148
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,930
That's.
That's how it was designed for 500 years

149
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:23,000
ago.
And that is exactly how it is today.

150
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,370
What possible.
Other argument could there be other than

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,180
previous colonial exploitation,
some actual meritocracy?

152
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,610
Is that the actual argument?
The flat white European,

153
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,470
small advanced.
It's different and Africa,

154
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,420
it's primitive.
Terror is maintained.

155
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,254
If you think about are you doing a 
degree in international relations and 

156
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,424
international development?
I've been going around to a lot of 

157
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,700
places recently saying,
well actually what do they teach?

158
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,543
And even international development,
they're teaching you how to 

159
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,640
underdeveloped parts of the world.
I mean there's a whole.

160
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,490
A whole colonial education system isn't 
just about Britain.

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,593
It's about the elite from Africa,
Caribbean and Asia coming into Europe 

162
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,590
and learning about economic policies and
political ideas which are actually there

163
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,900
in place to continue the oppression of 
the of the country.

164
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,380
So you have this idea that you can 
develop the global south through aid and

165
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,640
through technology and through et 
Cetera,

166
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,483
et cetera.
We've missed the point and it actually 

167
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:19,040
these places of the world of poor 
because the West is rich.

168
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,060
That was the same then as it is today.
That hasn't changed in any way,

169
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,820
shape or form.
It's integral,

170
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,030
I suppose,
isn't it,

171
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,013
that that story is concealed because it 
is at odds with the assumption of 

172
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,350
Justice and Mary that is required to 
maintain a power balance.

173
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,220
Yeah,
exactly.

174
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,660
I actually talk about whiteness as being
more like a psychosis than like anything

175
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,411
else,
right?

176
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,980
The idea of whiteness and progress and 
civilization,

177
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:45,830
et Cetera,
et cetera.

178
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,210
The ideas in the enlightenment that 
Europe is kind of the civilizing mission

179
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:54,270
that spreads that truth to the world.
That's not rational.

180
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,280
I mean there's no rational basis did it,
right?

181
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,680
Because there's a lot of.
I don't know if you've read any critical

182
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,514
whiteness studies,
people like David Rottiger and I'm 

183
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,870
knolling native who talk about the idea 
that you can kind of teach at whiteness.

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,200
If only white people would understand 
the problem historically,

185
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,930
then they'd change and become allies and
we'd all be happy.

186
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,880
Families actually I argue,
is much,

187
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,880
much,
much more serious than that.

188
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,440
The reason you have this myth of 
progress,

189
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,313
etc.
Is because that within the political 

190
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,484
economy,
the west needs to exploit the wrist and 

191
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:29,100
so what we do is we have this psychosis 
which says,

192
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,820
actually no.
NIce,

193
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,750
all right,
it's fine.

194
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:32,010
We're doing a good job,
etc.

195
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,933
Etc.
and that's to hide the fact that 

196
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,110
actually the we're really living on the 
back of children dying.

197
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,460
I mean that's what we're doing,
right?

198
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,294
Children die because of the system which
gives us money and so because we can't 

199
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,310
deal with it mentally,
emotionally,

200
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,260
we create these myths about how 
wonderful the world is,

201
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,930
right?
So it's like I say,

202
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,900
psychosis that has to conceal its 
essence in order to perpetuate.

203
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:56,901
And even as sort of a little while ago 
and that t via online news blog either.

204
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,710
We did an episode on like literal kids 
mining for some resource for your mobile

205
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:02,544
phone.
So it made a very clear connection 

206
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,630
between,
here we are in the weft,

207
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,540
ordinary people that don't feel like 
we've got blood on our hands,

208
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,630
but in our handheld device is like,
here he is,

209
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,170
he's seven years old.
He's got to go down.

210
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,110
Oh no,
it's like a ballroom.

211
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,973
And you feel like it doesn't belong in 
your understanding of the contemporary 

212
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,174
world.
Now one of these things about whiteness 

213
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,154
as power.
Obviously I as a white person that feel 

214
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:25,884
I like,
I have certain attitudes towards the 

215
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:32,361
state and my sense of alliance and 
allegiance Would be countercultural.

216
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,623
How am I categorized by a,
like in the terms of this new emergent 

217
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,340
narrative around power and oppression?

218
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,583
Uh,
it's interesting because this whole 

219
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,930
discussion about like white allies and 
it had this,

220
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,803
had this,
it was oxford yesterday talking about 

221
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,514
this and sometimes I feel a bit like a 
standup comedian when you kind of go 

222
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:52,694
around and he played the little display,
the audiences and you get different 

223
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,150
reactions and you tested your material.

224
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,810
It's good because I feel like an 
academic.

225
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,270
Because when you said I've done this at 
oxford is good already.

226
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,150
At the same level as oxford university 
with my questions,

227
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,020
but it was good because they actually is
a question of whiteness came up,

228
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,790
you know,
what can white people do where the white

229
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,010
people,
what can we do to solve the problem,

230
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,870
the federal,
and it's.

231
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,150
It's a tricky question because if you 
take my idea,

232
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:15,984
if you take what I'm arguing here that 
whiteness is a psychosis and psychosis 

233
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,334
are irrational,
so and actually in the left you can see 

234
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,530
this as much as you can see on the 
right,

235
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,753
so you have left wing people,
swp marxist who will make these global 

236
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,450
arguments about x,
y,

237
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,510
zed who will say they were on the side 
of the oppressed,

238
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,420
but actually when you look at what 
they're saying that they,

239
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,263
they just as deluded as the right wing 
fascist because whiteness as a concept 

240
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,610
is so important.
And I'll give you an example I'm at,

241
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,303
so anybody anybody's black and knows and
goes to black events and african 

242
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,290
caribbean community,
the swp,

243
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,470
a socialist workers party,
they're more prevalent than the police.

244
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,100
I mean they every day they're always 
there.

245
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,110
They're always there peddling marxism,
marxism,

246
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,940
marxism,
and I quite like mugs and by the way,

247
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,040
but one of these events,
there was a,

248
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:01,874
it was a few years ago,
there was a strike of set african farm 

249
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,424
workers and teachers were always having 
a strike here in this kind of moxies 

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,353
will rule the working class.
we're all workers were all in the same 

251
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,730
struggle,
etc.

252
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,910
Etc.
They were saying that we had to support.

253
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,650
We're going to support the workers in 
South Africa.

254
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,630
We had to support the teachers.
Right,

255
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,320
but they think about this for a second.
Work is inside africa.

256
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,154
Farm workers are pool are so poor 
because of trade policies that benefit 

257
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,803
british farmers and european farmers or 
farmers effectively and that 

258
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:31,954
impoverished in marginalizes them in 
their conditions or conditions that we 

259
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,840
could never even contemplated.
Right now.

260
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,674
Teachers are paid out of taxation from 
that very system which was floyd said 

261
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,540
african farmers,
so women were.

262
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,550
When teachers are asking for paintings 
and better pay,

263
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,623
what they're asking for is a better is 
more fruits from the exploitation of 

264
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,790
places like South Africa.
So in no way,

265
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,190
shape or form are these two people 
together?

266
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,430
Actually they opposed to completely 
opposed because teachers,

267
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,360
anybody on myself as well,
we make our money off their exploitation

268
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,613
and that's the psychosis of whiteness 
because you can't understand the 

269
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,830
actually your part,
we are,

270
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,740
all of us here are part of the problem,
not necessarily the solution,

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,633
but when you have a systemic 
contradiction such as that one within 

272
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:18,541
which your participation is voluntary,
other than like I've literally,

273
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,014
I'm out of the system now.
Like how do you avoid that aNd how can 

274
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,713
alliances be formed on that basis,
that thinking then if you think of a 

275
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,500
power like,
you know,

276
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,140
like I've what I thought was brilliant 
that,

277
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,840
that oj documentary when to use it for 
that,

278
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,683
they use that oj simpson documentary,
a story about race in the United States 

279
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,560
of America.
Stories about crime,

280
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,220
stories about commerce.
Capitalism a racial tension.

281
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:47,590
But I mean really in a way that I could 
understand.

282
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,150
Tell me a lot of important stories.
And a lot of it was about a oj simpson's

283
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,590
racial identity at a time when the civil
rights movement,

284
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,470
when people were making huge sacrifices 
and mohammed ali,

285
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,873
you know,
the sentence and gave up his belt and 

286
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,690
all of that stuff.

287
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,490
But like there was an interesting moment
where it said,

288
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,730
well why does the oj simpson,
because he is an african american man,

289
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:16,030
half the obligation to be like,
well you've got white.

290
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:16,864
Like you wouldn't know why athlete or 
white star would have that obligation 

291
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,424
would be expected to carry that mantle.
So it began to sort of challenge what 

292
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,790
whiteness and blackness mean as sort of 
categorization system.

293
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:29,624
So like if like,
you knoW what this distinction I exceed 

294
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:33,794
there is a historic colonial and indeed 
contemporary continuation of these 

295
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,170
themes and categories.
But,

296
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,460
but there,
there is this,

297
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,850
a crossover isn't there because let's 
say barack obama as the,

298
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,100
when he was the president of United 
States,

299
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,430
he was an african american man,
but he is in the,

300
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,160
if you use that argument about the south
african farmers,

301
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,000
the teachers who he is the puppet,
you know,

302
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,200
he's the president over folks on his 
team.

303
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,190
How does that all work?

304
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,170
Yeah,
I mean,

305
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,193
and this is part of the thing with a 
psychosis is I always say this isn't 

306
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,900
just for white people in any way,
shape or form.

307
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,160
Let people live.
Many,

308
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:05,994
many,
many believable would also kind of 

309
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,800
embrace this kind of psychosis.
All right?

310
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,390
I was one of the most critical people 
still am one of the most critical people

311
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:13,224
of barack obama's presidency.
You have a black president for after 

312
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,930
eight years,
literally every single indicator,

313
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,090
apartment,
employment.

314
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,190
And if a black people went down and even
if you look at employment,

315
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,390
black wages went down so much.
They actually,

316
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,410
employment was basically irrelevant.
And so you think then what we achieved,

317
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,990
what was achieved by these and actually 
the celebration of obama,

318
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,853
particularly by african americans and 
black people here in my mum cried when 

319
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:40,320
obama was elected.
That's part of that psychosis,

320
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:41,154
right?
That we think things are changing when 

321
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,014
actually if you look at the evidence 
suggests that none of these things are 

322
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,680
actually changing and in many ways to 
get in,

323
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,813
they get worse.

324
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,850
So then what's the value of that as a 
category?

325
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
If it is ultimately,
as you said,

326
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,514
literally meaningless.
In what sense is he an african american 

327
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,683
president?
Other than like he's able to say how he 

328
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,410
felt in shops and that kind of stuff.
And like,

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,353
you know,
like things that you fill in bloody 

330
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,500
hell.
This is sort of amazing and a fist bump.

331
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,483
Avoidance of literally superficial,
which I suppose is sometimes what I 

332
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:09,580
think race ought be in utopia.
Like in the,

333
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,463
a superficial monica.
It's what was the value and meaning of 

334
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,524
it.
Would you say that there really wasn't 

335
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:16,730
any?

336
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,150
Uh,
no,

337
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,050
there was.
So they'll,

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,780
you'll find some academics.
He will be very critical of obama.

339
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,883
But say,
well look,

340
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,110
it's limited what you could do.
That's the problem.

341
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,520
We can just move on.
It's not that big a deal,

342
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,850
right?
I'll tell you,

343
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,060
I'd actually take the opposite approach 
and stated that the symbolism of obama,

344
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:32,894
the point of obama's blackness,
one of the reasons why he got elected 

345
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,433
was part of to aid this idea of the 
psychosis was to aid this idea of the 

346
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,210
american dream.
For me.

347
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,420
Barrack obama's blacknEss is violent in 
itself.

348
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,910
Go on.
Because what does it do?

349
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:47,744
What is.
So what is it that my mom's grinder and 

350
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:49,860
mom was a radical in the,
in the,

351
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:52,250
in the sixties,
and all these politics about revolution,

352
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,103
etc.
Etc.

353
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,130
And she's crying on,
um,

354
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,083
on,
on the day this very near liberal 

355
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,983
politician,
you never offered one single thing to 

356
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:01,950
blake.

357
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,650
Never said he was gonna do anything for 
black people,

358
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,270
but we just kind of assumed because he's
black,

359
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,680
there's going to have something.
Right?

360
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,400
And then you see afterwards,
everybody's kind of praising the symbol.

361
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,650
You've got black family in the white 
house and obama with young black men,

362
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,420
but actually get belief that symbol.
What's that?

363
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,254
Trying to do,
that's trying to tell you that things 

364
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,000
have progressed,
that things have changed,

365
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,480
that progress is being made,
but again,

366
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,630
look at every single indicator tells you
that from black people,

367
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,940
particularly in America,
things are getting worse,

368
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:29,774
probably not better.
And so the symbol of obama and why his 

369
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,120
blackness,
how he used his blackness and why he got

370
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:35,954
one of the reasons he got elected is 
because it keeps us more diluted and 

371
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:41,720
tied into a system which can never 
providers freedom,

372
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,560
justice or equality.

373
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,160
People will hate being told that story I
fancy

374
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,100
and probably not the most popular to put
things,

375
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,960
but it's also the truth,
right?

376
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,500
That's right.
So that,

377
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:53,881
that,
that,

378
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,470
that type of critique,
we say no,

379
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,304
let's not get distracted by what appears
attractive and what appears beautiful 

380
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,690
and promising.
Look at how power is actually behaving.

381
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,033
So like to return to my prior point 
about like how do I as a white person 

382
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,823
from a working class background whose 
attitude is always been anti like me 

383
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:23,060
reaching for my little slice of the pie.
I like,

384
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,090
um,
like a,

385
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,740
like how do I,
um,

386
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,770
participate what like how do I,
like when you say that about the british

387
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:31,491
empire,
right?

388
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,550
I sort of think like,
god,

389
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,384
yeah,
it's all built on like biscuit tins or 

390
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:38,880
union jack on it and land and open glory
and light over the butcher and people in

391
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,660
India and africa and doing whatever was 
required and,

392
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,470
and nation was always a front for 
corporations anyway.

393
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,360
And the whole thing's been a black,
right?

394
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,263
I'm on board.
So like how do we have alliances that 

395
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,800
aren't caught up in sort of bureau 
bureaucracies such as that teacher,

396
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,630
south african farmer alliance.
How do we go,

397
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,464
well,
let's let the radical white folk in 

398
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,990
there.
There'll be of some use.

399
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,550
Or is it like,
can it not work?

400
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,070
I,
this is the bar,

401
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,913
the material we some testing now.
It isn't maybe the best [inaudible] I'm 

402
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,000
a big malcolm mixed fan.
I love medical mix and

403
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,680
may I know if that's all right with you 
boys.

404
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,603
More the merrIer.

405
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,643
Deb backup as a story in geography where
malcolm white lady comes to ask them a 

406
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,040
similar question,
what can white people do?

407
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,660
and he basically turns around and says 
nothing and in walks up and he feels bad

408
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:29,280
about it.
You have malcolm x anyway,

409
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,263
probably a bit nervous.
He's an intense guy and she was crying 

410
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:34,500
and she was really upset and he felt bad
about.

411
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:34,961
He's like,
okay,

412
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:36,410
I shouldn't said this actually.
Yep.

413
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,330
People have the responsibility to go 
into white communities and making these,

414
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,840
these arguments.
Um,

415
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,970
I've already advanced much more than 
that.

416
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,673
One of the things that malcolm used to 
do was just to go round and tell white 

417
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,760
people.
Literally they were devil.

418
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,030
I mean,
he'd say you do evil,

419
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,290
like what?
Look what you've done.

420
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,210
Look at this critique.
Um,

421
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,280
and I guess as,
as a black scholar,

422
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,810
an activist,
that's the most I can do.

423
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:56,644
I don't know if I can have the answer to
what you can do other than to prove the 

424
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,050
critique.
Runk I would love to be wrong.

425
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,730
But actually if I'm looking 
historically,

426
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:04,564
presently,
currently at the left as well as the 

427
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:06,844
right,
I don't see how you break out of that 

428
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,690
cycle.
That's why I call it a psychosis because

429
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:11,524
it's completely irrational.
There is nothing you can do to 

430
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,170
penetrate.
And actually to my,

431
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,120
of my,
my,

432
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,250
my work is more about what we do as 
black people.

433
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,980
We had a with,

434
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,813
of course that must be,
isn't it like how I would have a person 

435
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:23,440
or allegiance around like addiction or 
wherever because that's where,

436
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,950
that's just what I've been drawn to from
my particular wound,

437
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,083
like a.
And that's where I feel I know score on 

438
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,560
that so I can be relevant and I can be 
useful in that area.

439
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:36,600
I can't go around camp campaigning on 
behalf of the group that aren't,

440
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,040
don't share the experience of,
um,

441
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,670
but what I feel like pure conjecture,
of course,

442
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,990
given the nature of what I've just said 
might be the solution or my question is,

443
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,940
is it not that we weather these 
categorize these categorizations are,

444
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,783
um,
but the way wherever we find ourself 

445
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:59,521
within that sort of peculiar college,
all the light that we be the nine,

446
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,600
the cat,
like a suit,

447
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,380
a transcending the categories,
not the nine.

448
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,040
What the narrative is like.

449
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,873
I'm like,
I'm wars and his has happened and I'm 

450
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,610
aware of it now in the industries I work
in.

451
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,240
I work when I'm at meetings around 
television,

452
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,080
I think,
wow,

453
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:14,914
we're all white still.
I'm sort of aware of that into an but 

454
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,240
like what,
what's,

455
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,073
and that sort of super relevant and,
but what I'm interested in is that as 

456
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,790
long as our identity continues to 
rewrite those categories,

457
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,624
even if it's through overflow in them,
we continue in somehow to augment them 

458
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,121
by like,
you know,

459
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,390
like that by saying,
well,

460
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,224
no,
this is our story and this is what it 

461
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,534
is.
I completely accept the importance of 

462
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:42,760
it,
but how do we ever go,

463
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,710
right?
We don't win anymore.

464
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,200
We don't want power to work in that way.
How do we Challenge it in dismantling if

465
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:51,160
we are a wednesday two welded to somehow
to our categories?

466
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,750
Yeah,
and I think this is was,

467
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,260
um,
I think it really does.

468
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,980
It's really about taking onboard this 
critique in a very serious way.

469
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,460
And I don't think the left the left is a
general thing,

470
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,303
but people on the left markets,
other academics have done this in the 

471
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,170
sense.
So for example,

472
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:09,160
if you look at the mobilizations like 
occupy,

473
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,180
occupy wall street,
we're the 99 percent.

474
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm sorry,
that's an,

475
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,110
that's an offensive way to look at 
global global inequality.

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,880
If you are in,
if you,

477
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,743
if you own the average wage in britain,
hearing someone like the top four 

478
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:20,444
percent of earners in the entire world,
just recognizing that the conditions 

479
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,793
that we are not just white people,
black people who live with have hear a 

480
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,550
pause in a completely different 
situation to the conditions of people in

481
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,320
the third world.
So for example,

482
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,243
there was recently a child bereavement,
enough inner family circle of friends 

483
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,024
because a car accident and two years 
later everybody's still shocked by it 

484
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:44,720
and shook by it because it's so foreign,
but actually in many parts of the world,

485
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:49,310
children just die all the time when a 
child dies every 10 seconds because they

486
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:50,420
haven't got access to food.

487
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,880
So what that means is we're protected 
from that,

488
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,923
the horrors of the system.
So for us to pretend that we're all in 

489
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,880
this one big happy family of workers 
that that needs to go,

490
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,820
you say one thing to take that ethic of 
the equation,

491
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:05,720
completely understand that all of us 
here at a meeting included are complicit

492
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:07,370
in the system and benefit from this 
system.

493
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,860
I don't think you see that in much of 
the of the left.

494
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:10,694
Unfortunately that will be a starting 
point and maybe you can build a proper 

495
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:14,054
politics after that.

496
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,270
I sort of awakening.
Yeah.

497
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,210
Is that like what you said there like 
that?

498
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,990
There's that famous orwell quote,
you know,

499
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:24,991
the british working class is in India 
when I was on bill maher,

500
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,910
you have a day and like it's sort of a,
you know,

501
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,770
they very much romanticize a bomber and 
like,

502
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,610
they're very much like the opening.
I like bill miner,

503
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,720
but the opening jokes were very much 
about,

504
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,000
um,
you know,

505
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,660
sort of,
oh yeah,

506
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,171
well,
you know,

507
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,510
you're not a president.
Like about.

508
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,530
It was very romantic and nostalgic and 
of that.

509
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,080
And then the subsequent conversation was
again,

510
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,630
sort of about intricacies of the,
you know,

511
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:54,290
the democratic party in the way they 
elect candidates now for this is the way

512
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,124
you have trump is because this is,
this doesn't appeal to people on a 

513
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:59,390
visceral level.
It,

514
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,263
you're,
you're not addressing the inability of 

515
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,900
conventional politics to tell a 
truthful,

516
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,600
open,
clear story.

517
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,993
Um,
so how does politics have to alter is 

518
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,380
safe.
How do you end up in it like that?

519
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,223
Because I think both brexit and trump,
I see them more as failures of the left 

520
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:21,854
or failures of progressive truly 
progressive thinkers as opposed to 

521
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,800
triumphs for the right.
So what,

522
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,683
what is the obligation of progressive,
even if you don't use the terms like 

523
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,673
lifting rocks,
I can see how they're becoming 

524
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,840
problematic and somewhat redundant and 
they are part of the promo record,

525
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,520
but like this,

526
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,353
well,
it's in many ways the trump embracing a 

527
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,583
response to the logic of the lift as 
well in some ways if you have this 

528
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,304
national politics that says,
well how do we get the next weekend for 

529
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,870
the working class in the uk or the 
working class in America,

530
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,850
which unfortunately a lot of the lift 
has done.

531
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,700
Then being anti immigrant and being a 
bit racist,

532
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,593
it makes sense.
Here's a logical thing that's a logical 

533
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,010
thing to do.
That's the history of the lift,

534
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,030
particularly of britain as well.
So it really,

535
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,860
I mean,
it really thinking about the trade judy,

536
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,660
and think about like people always say,
let's go back to social democracy.

537
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,000
My family came to this country on the 
social democracy.

538
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,250
They were colored bars,
couldn't get taught in school.

539
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,550
So you weren't,
um,

540
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,490
weren't allowed to join.
The trade union weren't allowed to vote.

541
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,140
I'm into this association,
couldn't live in this area,

542
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:21,974
et cetera,
et cetera.

543
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,993
Actually under social democracy,
the racism that we're experiencing now 

544
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:26,600
and saying,
oh,

545
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,480
this is terrible.
It was like $5 worth right and left wing

546
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:33,650
social democracy working class.
And the racism was far more severe on an

547
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,484
open level than it is today.
So in some ways these aren't trump and 

548
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,014
brexit on,
on,

549
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,380
on alien to the lift.
The tool is that if you even corbion got

550
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:43,214
criticized because he never really came 
out about brexit and because there is a 

551
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,140
strong left wing argument that guy can,
you know,

552
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,890
you want to protect wages,
etc.

553
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:50,724
Etc.
Because a lot of the left is framed 

554
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,210
around the nation state,
right?

555
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,880
How do you protect britiSh workers,
how do you protect american workers,

556
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:56,714
et cetera.
And so what we need to do for the lift 

557
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,430
is to have a much more radical approach 
to politics.

558
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,713
And it's not like thIs never happened.
So if you look at people like eric told 

559
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,360
him,
right?

560
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,910
And neo marxist,
he wrote,

561
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,860
he wrote a lot of work to the black 
panthers,

562
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,610
american near marxist in the seventies.
I'm emmanuel wallace.

563
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:15,900
Dean talks about world systems theory,
so there is,

564
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,030
there is a theory that says,
look,

565
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:17,864
we need to basically divest of our 
privileges in the west and really 

566
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:24,050
understanding our place in the global 
system that works there.

567
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,003
Unfortunately it hasn't.
It hasn't necessarily worked to 

568
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:28,730
influence how politics work.

569
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,190
What do you mean divest of privilege?
I didn't like the sound of that

570
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,813
is about.
It's about acknowledging except as a 

571
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,520
black man,
for example.

572
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,860
I have to understand that I don't suffer
most of the of racism,

573
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,700
right?
I,

574
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,890
I'm not unemployed.
I don't ask him by the police.

575
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,090
I have higher education.
I have,

576
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,220
I am one to most people in the country,
right?

577
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,413
So I have to understand that,
that I'm in a privileged position and I 

578
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,540
have to understand also that because I'm
in the way that privilege come from,

579
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,000
it comes from the exploitation of people
that look like me,

580
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,760
which means I then have to build a 
completely different politics that says,

581
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,740
how do,
how do,

582
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,160
how do we relate to the least of us in a
sense?

583
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,930
How do we draw these global idea?
But,

584
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,203
um,
child deaths and politics around the 

585
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,300
world,
etc.

586
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,260
Etc.
Um,

587
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,163
And understanding that I to do this,
I'm going to have to give up my 

588
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,020
privilege and this is what people don't 
want to do.

589
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:20,580
Right?
This is why the probably the limit.

590
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:21,414
This is probably why I'll never work 
because for us in the west to really 

591
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:26,094
have a radical politics,
it will mean we have to give up 

592
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:30,300
privileges and to what extent are people
willing to do that?

593
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,413
I suppose the power structures that 
perpetuate all dependent on our 

594
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,440
unwillingness to give up comfort.
If,

595
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,650
if people had a sort of.
I'm more spiritual,

596
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,500
I would want to say attitude towards 
asceticism.

597
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,960
If people were kind of hardened to the 
idea of no,

598
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,250
I know what's right and you're not going
to be guiding me with your iphones.

599
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,600
You're going to feel like.
But it's very,

600
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:54,940
very hard to get there a couple of times
a week I think.

601
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:55,774
Would I be more happy if I was to fill 
my house with people who were refugees 

602
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,843
started that I didn't like?
What would my sum tote of happiness go 

603
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,114
up?
I'd send to be spending less time 

604
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,490
reflecting on why shouldn't really be 
having this privilege should I know,

605
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,413
but much more time we bloody hell.
We brought the toilet or whatever it 

606
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:13,870
would be that day,
you know,

607
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:14,704
like so like,
but it requires it that I guaranteed it 

608
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,260
this wicked speech about where he said 
like,

609
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:21,094
you know,
so there's no point in us overflowing 

610
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,190
the british then replacing them with a 
comparable system.

611
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,533
You might have heard this given that you
have degree courses in racial politics 

612
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,020
like so,
but there's a bit where he goes like,

613
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:33,790
you know,
the fact is it comes down to the idea of

614
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:37,840
our attitudes towards comfort.
As long as We are addicted to comfort,

615
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,170
then it's really hard on some level,
on a personal level,

616
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,910
you have to go like,
this is where.

617
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:44,260
This isn't theory,
this is where.

618
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,380
This isn't something you read about 
books,

619
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,160
scope.
Am I prepared to give up my only phone?

620
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,980
Would I be happier if I had less stuff 
on?

621
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,430
On some level I sort of feel I would be.
And what prevent.

622
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,540
There's a kind of fear though,
indeed that prevents me from going,

623
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,090
right.
I'm just going to walk out into,

624
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,963
because I suppose my personal privilege 
and wealth is what I feel protects me 

625
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,500
from this system,
from this world.

626
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,261
Yeah.
And I,

627
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:08,380
I can see why people don't quite,
you know,

628
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,200
people know who wants to give up stuff,
right?

629
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,390
And particularly if you work in glass to
give you a blank,

630
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,120
um,
use this discrimination,

631
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,350
right?
So we're seeing that is clearly unequal.

632
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,220
It's clearly not fair and we fill it 
badly treated as well.

633
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,690
So that's also part of the problem that 
says,

634
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,600
what am I going to give up?
This have worked quite hard to get it as

635
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,300
well,
but unfortunately that's the reality.

636
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,160
Huey newton,
the black panther is a,

637
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,290
wrote a book,
a revolutionary suicide.

638
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,360
They said this is what revolution is 
about.

639
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,080
Understanding that you have to be able 
to give up for those people who are,

640
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,780
who are less than Mrs.
White.

641
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,100
I have very little faith in this 
happening in europe.

642
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,430
And in effect,
the,

643
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,273
the concept we always talk about as a 
radical concept is blackness because 

644
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:47,074
he's,
my blackness is the way that I look at 

645
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:49,120
this is the,
it's the hair is the,

646
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,750
that's a connection to people who are at
the literal bottle.

647
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,180
So when we talk about the child that 
dies every 10 seconds,

648
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,830
the vast majority of those already in 
africa.

649
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,803
Right?
So that gives me a connection that you 

650
00:29:58,841 --> 00:29:59,674
don't,
that you don't necessarily have right 

651
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:01,444
now.
And that should give me a connection I 

652
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:04,300
should have.
And that should tie me into politics and

653
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,750
remind me this is a global struggle,
not a national struggle,

654
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,743
which is why I have a bit more faith in.
That's kind of was kind of black 

655
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,820
movements then I would have in,
in the us and european movement.

656
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,713
I guess

657
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,883
if however,
the only people that care about that 

658
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,093
exploitation and you know,
even in the most severe form such as 

659
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:24,424
child deaf,
are people that have a visible and 

660
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,873
cultural identification with it.
And even then it remainS theoretical 

661
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:32,764
impact.
I don't know what.

662
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,180
To what degree are you involved in 
activism?

663
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,060
Like they're like,
how is anything going to change?

664
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,923
In fact,
it seems to me that until you get to 

665
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,370
that point that huey newton point about 
self sacrifice,

666
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:46,060
which is really martyrdom,
is an idea that again,

667
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:49,780
is resourced from theology.
You know,

668
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,303
how,
how without a spiritual component is 

669
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:53,614
radical radical change going to occur 
because how the human beings access 

670
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,340
ideas such as one less true for 
fraternity transcendence,

671
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,990
relinquishing individual identity 
through social and cultural like or,

672
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,960
or material forms.
Like how'd you go?

673
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,923
You know,
because it doesn't have the necessary 

674
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,880
potency is not emotive enough.
It doesn't seem.

675
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,610
Yeah,
I mean there's,

676
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,410
there's two parts.
I mean,

677
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,243
one I think in terms of you look at the 
black struggle and that kind of global 

678
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:20,850
politics.
There are people at friends fan on a.

679
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,693
We'll talk about the idea that user who 
was a martinican I'm postcolonial 

680
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,014
theorist and he will talk about that,
that you need to sleeping beauty of the 

681
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,164
european working class to wake up 
basically and you need those allies to 

682
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:32,254
have this,
this,

683
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,240
this revolution.
Even the panthers would,

684
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,530
would have said this because they were 
marxists.

685
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,943
Um,
because of like you said that you need 

686
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,440
to have this almost spiritual.
It's something beyond just rationality,

687
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,090
something more than.
Yes,

688
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,630
this is why I say it's probably never 
gonna happen,

689
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
right?
One,

690
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,523
we have a system which has always 
protected the western working class who 

691
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,303
always from the worst exploitation,
a provided comfort and wealth and 

692
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:55,000
provided it as an outlet.

693
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,110
So look at the left.
Now they're saying,

694
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,944
look,
can we just get a bigger share of the 

695
00:31:58,211 --> 00:31:59,860
pie?
Not can we change global poverty?

696
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:01,610
Can we get a big share of that?
But yeah.

697
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
And so I'd be unlikely to see that 
happen,

698
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,750
but can you see that kind of more 
emotional if you like,

699
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,070
theological,
spiritual in this concept of blackness.

700
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,000
This is why log.
Yeah,

701
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:10,440
that's,
that's,

702
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,350
that's a potential possibility.
And rather than wait and try and get the

703
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,790
allyship of people who are dumping 
river,

704
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,653
going to have massive allergy,
let's just go with what we have and 

705
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:22,360
organize what we have and produce a 
movement that can actually this,

706
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,223
that by itself would be enough to 
destabilizing and kick the bucket a 

707
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:26,110
little bit.

708
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,410
I see.
That's good.

709
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,270
But it's,
for me,

710
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,143
it's more entrenched in precisely 
because of it's inability to transcend 

711
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,023
systems of categorization.
There have been previously established 

712
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,130
by the power dynamic that you seek to 
overflow.

713
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,711
Well,
no,

714
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,070
because that's

715
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,330
the thing about,
about blackness.

716
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:43,610
I mean in some ways that you can say,
and this is the critique,

717
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,803
we get a lot lower.
This is racial categories that are from 

718
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,471
europe,
et cetera,

719
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,170
et cetera,
et cetera.

720
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,370
But actually blackness is concept.
Talking about.

721
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,100
It's really the opposite to race a race 
is about biology is about hierarchy.

722
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,140
It's about europeans looking at us and 
saying,

723
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,420
you are not really human.
Blackness is,

724
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:01,010
oh,
this is looking at each other and going,

725
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,611
oh,
okay.

726
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,590
We've probably gotten the same african 
background.

727
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:04,680
We've got that dissent,
uh,

728
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,680
we're seeing these europeans are doing 
these terrible things.

729
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,770
They're trying to categorize it in this 
way and we're going to reject that.

730
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,020
So blackness isn't a bad hierarchies in 
the bad.

731
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:12,854
Biology isn't about genetics.
It's about saying there's a shared 

732
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,710
shared meaning of color that's a shared 
meaning of politics.

733
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:22,820
And we come together and organize in 
order to benefit the community.

734
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,650
But it doesn't have those elements of 
race,

735
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,903
so it's a different concept for me.
Now shifting the idea of reparations 

736
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:34,330
because it's sort of,
I suppose it's a practical idea.

737
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,193
Can you talk to him about that?
That for western wealth is founded on 

738
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:38,584
colonialism,
that there could be a redemptive 

739
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,790
mentions or is that idea?

740
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,621
Um,
yeah.

741
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,310
So if basically if you look through 
historically,

742
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,233
it's very clear and very obvious that 
the wealth of the west is built on 

743
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,950
slavery,
colonialism and genocide,

744
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:54,350
like very clear.
And if you just take slavery,

745
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:57,230
for example,
I mean slavery is about 300 year system,

746
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,610
uh,
places like britain.

747
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,590
America is literally built off the back 
of it.

748
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,250
Parts of london.
Liverpool wouldn't really exist.

749
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,980
Glasgow in scotland,
scotland to get off the slavery.

750
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,814
But my son name's andrews,
so that should tell you everything you 

751
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,810
need to know.
slavery and scotland,

752
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,470
birmingham,
even because it was not a poor we get,

753
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,710
we tend to get away as well from some of
these slavery stink if you like,

754
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,020
but the industry evolution,
james,

755
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,870
what matthew boat and they were all 
heavily involved in slavery,

756
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,970
took lots and lots of money from 
somewhere.

757
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,610
So if you think about the industrial 
revolution,

758
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,750
which is typically seen to be the marker
of the west right,

759
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,560
and how progressive it is and scientist 
cetera,

760
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,394
et cetera,
or the first real commodity that was 

761
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,580
made in just revolution was cotton and 
cotton grown in britain.

762
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,990
Right?
I mean they don't grow on it.

763
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:42,824
They got caught and was in America.
It was in the caribbean and so is that 

764
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,930
that commodity and that wealth from,
from the cotton industry,

765
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:48,764
which was from the slave trade,
which really gets reinvested back into 

766
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:51,764
the industrial revolution and therefore 
you're able to have the rest of the 

767
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,250
program,
etc.

768
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,083
Etc.
So the money that you needed to have 

769
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,440
something like the industry revolution 
is 100 percent tied up into,

770
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,550
into slavery.
So tHat's what we mean.

771
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,271
Birmingham,
for example,

772
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:03,104
made some,
some large proportion of all the guns 

773
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:08,570
and all the shackles that were used in 
the entire slaved rate.

774
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,070
We only made the guns in shackles.
They were barely involved.

775
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,570
Exactly.
British ships,

776
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,270
british,
even things like,

777
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:19,100
um,
finance capitalism,

778
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,150
insurance starts with the slave trade.
Lloyd's of london,

779
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:22,984
you celebrate it.
I think it was 400 years anniversary of 

780
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:28,040
the day.
The ceo comes on tv and says we're happy

781
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:31,100
to have our roots in ensuring the 
merchant trade.

782
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,050
And what she meant was literally the 
slave trade.

783
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,260
That's what you talk about,
slave trading in lloyd's of london,

784
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,094
the merchant rate psychosis,
but just a few ships tried to sporting 

785
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,323
goods.

786
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,320
So you can see the roots of that.
Financial institutions are cities ever.

787
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,950
You probably couldn't have much of the 
world that we have today with it,

788
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,843
without slavery.

789
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,220
Capitalism,
I suppose,

790
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,220
you know,
like one component in it,

791
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,620
like,
you know,

792
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,160
sort of creating excess value at excess 
worth.

793
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,590
SO anythiNg you can do to reduce 
overheads,

794
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,563
like,
like we found ways of reducing the next 

795
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,510
stuff from other countries.
Get other people to work for no money at

796
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:15,740
all.
And that's really,

797
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,550
that's the all the line and the unicorn 
and the land and the hope of glory.

798
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,730
It's,
that's what it,

799
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,723
yeah,
I mean that's 100 percent and what it 

800
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,900
does consume.
And so if you think about reparations in

801
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:27,734
America,
most of this work has been done in 

802
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:30,930
America and they tried to calculate,
um,

803
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,070
I'm pretty strong legal precedence,
so 300 years of unpaid,

804
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,953
unpaid labor.
You just work out what the labor would 

805
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,420
have been,
what the cost would have been,

806
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:40,250
what people should have got paid for the
work that they did.

807
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,433
Um,
and then there's also a precedence 

808
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:45,020
around trauma and abuse.
So for exAmple,

809
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,400
for the holocaust he talked about 
earlier,

810
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,473
germany's paid airbags like $90 million 
or something like that because the 

811
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,113
numbers are maybe more than germany's 
actually paid out reparations for the 

812
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,504
harm.
That was cool.

813
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,823
So let me say these two categories and 
say that you've got to pay for unpaid 

814
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,920
labor.
You've got to pay for trauma.

815
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,360
Uh,
in the states,

816
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:00,194
they reckon it's anywhere between four 
point nine and 15 point 6 billion 

817
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,190
trillion trillion dollars that's owed to
african americans.

818
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,320
It would essentially unravel that's 
nation,

819
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,154
that system as we know it.
That's why it can't be countenanced 

820
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:19,410
thought discussed because you can't have
the United States of America.

821
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,161
Now that we're,
again,

822
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:20,994
we're framing it economically.
And I read this wicked thing off of 

823
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,690
this.
A native american,

824
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:26,620
he called himself or maybe even of 
Indiana,

825
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:27,970
I can't remember,
like a,

826
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,020
like activist and he said all these sort
of systems,

827
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:32,910
you don't come up with marxism 
capitalism,

828
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:36,010
they're all sort of your ideas when in 
and none of them were best.

829
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,720
We have a completely different framework
for understanding reality.

830
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,440
But,
and you can see that with something like

831
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,470
reparation that what begins to unravel a
national identity,

832
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,363
it will curious.
I fought in that James Baldwin 

833
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:52,614
documentary where he goes,
that the whole category of negro is 

834
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,500
required in order for,
uh,

835
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,350
the doormen and pat the dog,
the dominant power,

836
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:07,140
I don't know,
sort of force to have,

837
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,931
uh,
enough,

838
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:10,380
uh,
identity to cast a shadow onto that.

839
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,580
That category is created in order for 
whiteness to prevail,

840
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,410
not only economically,
but also kind of psychologically because

841
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:20,244
in a way economics is there sort of an 
external system that comes from 

842
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,940
somewhere and it,
and as,

843
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,140
for all forms of categorization master 
that they,

844
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,013
these,
that I suppose one of the things that 

845
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,653
we're arguing these,
there is no essence to categorization 

846
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,624
these external forms that 
retrospectively except for that moment 

847
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,024
where you talked about blackness is 
having some veracity in terms of visual 

848
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:41,050
identification.
But I was,

849
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,100
I was sayiNg then the um,

850
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,090
the,
how,

851
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,770
like with that reparation argument you 
can't.

852
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,010
So in a sense like what would happen if 
they give you,

853
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,910
pursue that?
Where does that go?

854
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,340
Yeah.
Well guess this is,

855
00:38:58,341 --> 00:38:59,174
this is the,

856
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,120
the cool de sac of reparations is on 
word to put it.

857
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,963
I dunno.
So logically there's no real argument 

858
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:06,700
against reparations.
Look at.

859
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,680
So you look at,
so people talk about,

860
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,420
oh it was a long time ago,
things have passed,

861
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,283
etc.
etc.

862
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,970
But actually the effects is still very,
very,

863
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:13,804
very,
very clear.

864
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,690
not just what are the descendants of 
enslaved but also in africa.

865
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,790
I mean,
just the populating africa today,

866
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,050
extend alone has had a huge negative 
impact on the economy so you can see the

867
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:23,884
effects of slavery as though their 
reparations were paid to the slave 

868
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,414
owners.
Imagine that and actually gave her 

869
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,710
praises tO this label because it was 
that there was that much money involved.

870
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,940
They will have to give me some money.
Right?

871
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,863
They serve.
Sorry.

872
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,080
Losing single slaves must be terrible 
hardship.

873
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,580
Exactly.
There was a.

874
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,600
You'd a ucl unIversity college london,
just a legacy of british slavery project

875
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,673
and they've traced where the equivalent 
of 2 billion pounds that went to the 

876
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,844
british owners of slaves at the 
emancipation wind and you can see it's 

877
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,370
in the church is in the middle classes 
in david cameron's family.

878
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,690
It's literally forever for the economy,
so it's very clear there's a problem and

879
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,850
it needs to be restitution paid for that
problem,

880
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,880
but you're right though,
when you start to add up these numbers,

881
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,490
I mean if it's 15 trillIon in in the 
states,

882
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,770
what would that be for the uk?
You talking about?

883
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,660
You can't.
It's impossible.

884
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,900
It's literally impossible for the west 
to pay these kind of sum of money.

885
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:15,510
It would destroy.
It would destroy us.

886
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,963
There is no west in order to do it.
It means that the west has to dismantle 

887
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:22,490
itself.
The power,

888
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,383
In fact,
don't all arguments about power reach 

889
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,023
this nexus that well,
in order for the power to respond 

890
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:30,044
correctly,
it would have to dismantle itself 

891
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:33,080
whether you're,
say you're talking about a transnational

892
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,630
corporation,
if you're too matt lloyd's,

893
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,473
lloyd's in order to behave rationally 
and acknowledge its origins would have 

894
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:43,160
to not be lloyds anymore or gmo for that
time.

895
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,740
they were putting out cars they knew 
were going to catch fire,

896
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:47,360
but it works out cheaper to let it 
happen.

897
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,080
The only sort of possible responses for 
there not to me.

898
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,103
So the systemic changes required are so 
absolute that they in a sense defy the 

899
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,540
dynamic because it's like if,
uh,

900
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,230
if you say right America,
britain,

901
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,350
colonial,
former colonial or colonial nations have

902
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:04,190
to repeat it.

903
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,093
But,
and what I feel like is that 

904
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:07,500
transference of wealth to africa,
if,

905
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,443
unless there is systemic change or you 
have now is now the dominant forces 

906
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:17,360
within africa behave in that way and in 
a way isn't it a bit of a red air in,

907
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,600
in that it's sort of,
I think is it still happening,

908
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,150
are sort of very simplistic,
unproductive but bloody hell.

909
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,580
What did you expect when you came on in?
Like,

910
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,630
like sort of my argument is a bit like,
but people sort of.

911
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,820
It goes a bit like this,
right?

912
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:32,060
You can't have slavery no more people 
have like it's bothering too many.

913
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,780
People are like,
I've got influence,

914
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,120
but what we can have is will pay people 
the absolute bare minimum.

915
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,410
There'll be a subjugated under cloud.
So things just move on.

916
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,433
If power finds a way of manifesting 
itself continually and making the 

917
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,053
minimum compromises,
which is why I think this is where the 

918
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,873
power of the reparations argument you 
follow it through to its logical 

919
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:56,204
conclusion,
tells you that the problem is 

920
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,980
irresolvable within our political and 
economic system,

921
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,853
and this is where you need to have a 
radical change and actually what we 

922
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:06,380
should be organized will revolutionize 
the change you need to have.

923
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:08,780
Their institution needs to be made,
cannot be made in this.

924
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,280
Again,
to quote medical mix.

925
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,630
Uh,
this system is,

926
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,610
um,
it's impossible to have freedom,

927
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:14,444
justice and equality for black people in
the same way that it's impossible for a 

928
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,390
chicken to late a duck egg.
It's just not meant to happen.

929
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,423
Right?
And once we realized it will start 

930
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,010
thinking of much bigger solutions to our
problems,

931
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,791
that's the power of,
for me,

932
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:26,624
that's a pair of their operations 
argument to tell you how see how's 

933
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,950
embedded in the system is actually quite
brilliant.

934
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:31,311
Yeah,
it is.

935
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,510
Because it leads you to the point and 
going,

936
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,291
yeah,
but hang on a minute.

937
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,150
If you did that,
there would be no America.

938
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,390
And then that tells you,
oh,

939
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,500
America is therefore built on it.
Exactly.

940
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,780
And that's the problem.
So let's think about different solutions

941
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,890
and when you think about power manifests
and inch and giving concessions,

942
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,530
this is kind of what we see with the 
reparations debate.

943
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,723
So carrie con,
which is a caribbean collection of 

944
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,173
caribbean countries,
are currently arguing for reparations 

945
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,510
and there they've kind of stopped asking
for money.

946
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:59,060
Now it's about can we get some 
development aid?

947
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,850
Can we get an apology?
Can we get some education,

948
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,490
will do tHe apology for it,
for it.

949
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,940
It's a different set of demands,
a set of demands that the west could do,

950
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:11,870
right?
It's not impossible.

951
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:14,450
They could do this and then it could 
absolve them of theIr guilt to say,

952
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:14,751
well look,
we,

953
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:15,501
yeah,
we apologize.

954
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,500
We gave you this development aid.
We wiped off third ward did,

955
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,060
but it actually didn't change the 
problem.

956
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,960
Problem is doing it.
The issues are still there.

957
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:21,794
The structures are still there.
So you can actually do reparations in a 

958
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,610
way that makes things worse,
not better.

959
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,560
Unfortunately.
Yes,

960
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,543
I say,
but it's like it's one of those spreads 

961
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:32,180
that if you pull out it,
things fall apart.

962
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,100
It makes me your right.
So what kind of,

963
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,790
what are you going to spend the rest of 
your,

964
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,350
I mean you might not know,
but what,

965
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:44,150
what were your most immediate objectives
in terms of bringing about change?

966
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,850
Where do you like now that you know all 
this stuff now,

967
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,240
the teacher,
the staff in your position,

968
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,730
you're in what you're gonna do.
Um,

969
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,070
so I think in terms of the book I'm 
coming out next year,

970
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:56,570
black black radicalism is a manifesto of
theory theoretically,

971
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:57,404
but also practically they say,
well actually what is black radicalism 

972
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:00,800
mean?
What does this politics do?

973
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,663
What does it lead us to?
And where it leads us to is to an 

974
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:04,004
organization that transcends a nation 
state that connects us to the poorest 

975
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,930
and the most abject,
that condition.

976
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,540
And so it's actually less work on 
building revolution.

977
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,040
and so it's kind of built on 'em.
So when malcolm x,

978
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,913
like you,
I probably have mentioned malcolm like 

979
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,350
10 more times before we,
before we finished where malcolm dies,

980
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,050
he's working on the organization of afro
american unity.

981
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,263
He says this organization is,
is the revolutionary organization 

982
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,900
because you have a,
you have a place here,

983
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:28,640
you have a place in New York place in 
caribbean,

984
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:29,474
a place in Jamaica replacing and garner 
a place in all over the world and you 

985
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,563
connect this organization together and 
now you've got that kind of unity and 

986
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,380
solidarity across borders.

987
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,390
They can actually have a proper 
revolutionary change.

988
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,370
so this is the word I'm trying to do 
currently.

989
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,480
Hey,
what do you think is the significance of

990
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:49,510
malcolm x's islam?
To me it was a muslim.

991
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,723
It was a lack of proper cloth.
He was a devout muslim like you because 

992
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,400
you're coming at him from the angle of 
being a black man in england.

993
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:02,680
2017,
like,

994
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,553
like isn't as much or could it be argued
that is it a muslim icon as well as a 

995
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,500
african american or black icon?
And how did those categories in a sec,

996
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,440
particularly in a climate where 
islamaphobia,

997
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,450
so president.
Yeah,

998
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,560
so I think malcolm question came out of 
nowhere.

999
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,920
Being a muslim is a.
He's not incidental,

1000
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:22,530
right?
And actually malcolm,

1001
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,010
when malcolm becomes really radical,
some outcomes in the nation of islam for

1002
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,620
about 13,
13 years when he comes out of prison and

1003
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:30,454
it transforms him,
but the nation of islam is very much a 

1004
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:34,294
religious organization in that he says 
that the solution to people's problems 

1005
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:38,860
is to become muslim and that's kind of 
the.

1006
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,713
You just become muslim and as a prophecy
where god's going to wipe away all the 

1007
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:42,994
white people and we'll be fine.
So we need to do is be muslim and he 

1008
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,140
sees that that's,
that's the kind of religion,

1009
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,033
whether it's islam or christianity or 
whatever it is that you don't want to 

1010
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:53,200
have basically because it limits you and
you don't really do anything.

1011
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,320
You just pray.
And eventually malcolm leaves because he

1012
00:45:56,321 --> 00:46:00,070
sees the limits of any because it 
becomes a sunni sunni,

1013
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:00,660
sunni muslim.

1014
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,580
He goes,
he goes,

1015
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,890
he goes to.
He goes to maker.

1016
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:04,724
He has a.
He has a different kind of islam and he 

1017
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:12,211
becomes in many ways more developed so 
he finds the mosley must incorporate,

1018
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,600
but very clearly in the ballot or the 
bullet speech in [inaudible] 64.

1019
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,610
He says,
start a speech,

1020
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,300
says,
look,

1021
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,133
I'm a muslim,
but you need to leave your religion at 

1022
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,114
home.
Keep your religion between you and your 

1023
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:23,824
gut because this is not.
This is not what we're talking about 

1024
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,643
when we do this organization work.
This is black people stuff and you can 

1025
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:32,020
be whatever religion you want to be,
but it has no impact on the politics.

1026
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,150
So malcolm makes it very,
very clear separation.

1027
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,163
Do you think that was a political move 
knowing that there was actually a 

1028
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,253
trenchant christianity,
even black population in America that 

1029
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:39,514
time?
He didn't want to caUse a rift in that 

1030
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:41,944
way,
but I think

1031
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:42,803
so important philosophically because I 
think he's saying he's just saying that 

1032
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,314
religion is that religion is something 
that makes you connect to the world and 

1033
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:50,024
makes you.
It gives you spirituality and it gives 

1034
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:53,630
you something personally.
Religion is not something that can solve

1035
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:54,710
any of our problems on earth.

1036
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,551
Yeah,
but that's,

1037
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:56,384
to me mate,
is the big argument of secularism that 

1038
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:00,110
religion is a private matter.
uh,

1039
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,243
the,
um,

1040
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,833
whereas I think of like spirituality,
not religion because it's such a hot 

1041
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:06,224
potato as having the motivational power 
to bring about the kind of revolution 

1042
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,730
revolution that's required because I 
don't,

1043
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,663
you know,
if you're sort of when you sort of get 

1044
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:15,643
start to tee up on that precipice that 
you'll take into by thinking when you 

1045
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:20,870
pursue that reparation argument when you
think,

1046
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,704
oh my god,
that would mean the dismantling of the 

1047
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:23,580
entire,
uh,

1048
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,443
europe as we understand it and the 
United States of America as we 

1049
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:27,704
understand it.
It also sort of revealed he didn't 

1050
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,500
narratives the way around.
The way that power transcends nation has

1051
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,334
continued historically massed by flags 
and our own willingness to participate 

1052
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:37,804
in their rituals.
Whether it's consumer rituals or daft 

1053
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:42,820
secular holidays.
And suddenly all of this is exposed.

1054
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,070
And I think that if you're asking people
to take on board ideas as radical as you

1055
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:48,940
know,
as simple as radical,

1056
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:52,180
as seemingly trivial as put down your 
phone and start caring about little kids

1057
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,490
down a mine,
the only way they're going to do that is

1058
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:57,550
we have some connection to something 
transcendent.

1059
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:58,384
And I don't know.
And I obviously say this is a white 

1060
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:01,654
person and I was really enjoying the 
moment mate where I was talking to you 

1061
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,840
about malcolm x.
I was like,

1062
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,280
there's bits where I was going to 
contradict you.

1063
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:08,470
I thought this is good.
This is good stuff.

1064
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,620
Professor of black studies now.
Yet again on the subject of malcolm x,

1065
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,580
my feeling is that people are going to 
need to find a resource that's extremely

1066
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,020
potent in order to countenance such 
sacrifice.

1067
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,860
And I know the civil rights movement in,
in its origins,

1068
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:30,694
you know,
like sort of them early student type 

1069
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,130
prOtests where then girls got murdered 
and.

1070
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,520
All right,
I've read the brilliant thing.

1071
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:37,860
I think it bothered that malcolm 
blackboard.

1072
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,703
So it's pretty good pop thing.
But you're saying that the kind of 

1073
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,564
allegiances were formed.
Then what sort of local communal and 

1074
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:43,954
tight and he was,
I think it was an essay on house or the 

1075
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:48,820
limitations of social media and how like
you need sort of proper connections,

1076
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,600
but then people also were christian in 
that like,

1077
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,434
you know,
there were other sort of like they were 

1078
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,023
transcendent belief systems like whereas
you said very plainly and overtly there 

1079
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,150
boldly that religions not going to do 
nothing.

1080
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,920
Well,
like I don't feel like,

1081
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:03,980
you know,
mark,

1082
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,220
I'm very,
very evident to me the way that religion

1083
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,054
is used to sort of categorize subjugate 
divided to the shame and all those 

1084
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:11,404
things.
But I feel like how can we transcend 

1085
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,403
these systems of categorization unless 
it is by saying they read some essence 

1086
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:20,250
to the self and some essence to the 
whole world.

1087
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,071
I mean,
I think,

1088
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:21,970
like I said,
I don't think so.

1089
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,470
Even even with malcolm,
he says,

1090
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:24,304
look,
split the two you couldn't separate is 

1091
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:27,100
islam from his politics.
Right.

1092
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,440
And I think that that does motivate 
people to do things.

1093
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,513
I think the key thing is to say that 
there isn't one religious answer and I 

1094
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:34,294
think that's what math was basically 
trying to say is if you're a christian 

1095
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:37,780
and these motivate you,
if you're a muslim is motivate you.

1096
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:40,090
If you were jewish and it motivates you 
or whatever religion you are,

1097
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,600
we use that to motivate you,
but actually in terms of the program,

1098
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:44,434
in terms of what we're going to do in 
terms of where we go next in terms of 

1099
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,760
the alliances that we make,
religion just going to get into weight.

1100
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,230
I every level.
Right,

1101
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,363
and separate and saying that look,
the earthly problems that we have with 

1102
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,140
the problems that we have and in some 
senses blackness.

1103
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,183
The way malcolm talks about the.
We'll talk about it has that version of 

1104
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,750
spirituality to it.
Has that other connection to it

1105
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,703
been the same way as you were saying 
that malcolm x meant when he was saying 

1106
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,083
religion will get in the way.
What was ultimately a rice get in the 

1107
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:10,744
way?
If like if you take your argument of 

1108
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,084
blackness as the motivate in a sort of 
bond for a sort of a revolutionary 

1109
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:18,170
movement,
where,

1110
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,530
where does that,
what's the goal of that?

1111
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,450
Where does that.
We've won the war.

1112
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,113
Yeah,
so the idea is always like I guess if 

1113
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,034
you look at malcolm's politics will be 
revolutionary panafricanism at the 

1114
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:31,184
african revolution and in and that's 
kind of when you've got rid of europe 

1115
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:36,050
and China is agitating,
you've got different economy,

1116
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:37,010
you've got politics,
right?

1117
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,590
But that's never,
that's never been the end for that.

1118
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,240
Politics always said,
well look,

1119
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,933
african and black people in general 
contact pot in the global revolution 

1120
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,700
because we ain't got nothing.
Like we don't have anything sweet.

1121
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,553
Or where was the.
Nobody at kohl's on I'm blabbing have 

1122
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:50,494
enough.
But when you have a power base and If 

1123
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:53,600
you could do this revolution,
that revolution could.

1124
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,900
That would firstly probably undermine 
western capitalism to the point he would

1125
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:59,120
no longer exist,
but he would give you the ability to,

1126
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:02,060
to join in with other revolutions and 
other groups and other and support those

1127
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,410
groups.
So the black,

1128
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,160
the black revolution is if you let the 
starting point to the global revolution,

1129
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,200
but you have to have that black 
revolution first.

1130
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:10,580
I guess the argument.

1131
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah,
that's sort of my.

1132
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,820
Why is that?
Why would you,

1133
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,683
why would it have to stop?
Because that has to be at the level of 

1134
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,870
the most oppressed or most severe.
Why?

1135
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,471
Well,
I know.

1136
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:20,304
I guess in theory you could have say the
equistar in China because the other 

1137
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:23,850
parts of the world.
But if we're saying look from a,

1138
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,110
from a black perspective,
you say look,

1139
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,973
this is.
And also if you take that logic of the 

1140
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,190
most severe,
the worst depression,

1141
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,770
there is a strong argument for africa 
being that place.

1142
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,530
And I suppose my motivating because of 
the

1143
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,543
economic ramifications as well,
like if africa as a continent says we 

1144
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:41,450
don't want trans,
like all of that,

1145
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,890
we want a clean slate from that.
So in a bloody hell when you think about

1146
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,820
that debt cancellation stuff,
it's not like a.

1147
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,740
And as an active large,
yes we will cancel that debt.

1148
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,633
What we give you by nikudos stuff and 
it's not like an act of kindness is it 

1149
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,350
has in stopping,
so in adding insult to injury,

1150
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,180
again,
I keep going back up again,

1151
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:02,980
but he's a great and in the metaphors he
says,

1152
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:05,860
if you,
if you stab me in the back and then pull

1153
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,050
out a knife six inches,
then I can't.

1154
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:08,884
I'm not going to thank you for that.
And this one day cancellation 

1155
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,230
effectively is like pulling out a knife 
six inches.

1156
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,403
The knife still there.
You haven't told him that you haven't 

1157
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:15,874
changed the debt cancellation debt in 
the first place was just a neo-colonial 

1158
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,850
tool to keep people in a nice no.
So none of the things that the west will

1159
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:25,090
ever offer you is really is really 
solving the problem.

1160
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,890
You've got to take the knife out and 
heal the wound.

1161
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,220
How do you get on with making these 
arguments outside of academia?

1162
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,250
How'd you get on with a young black 
people that are not within academia?

1163
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,700
How do you convey these kinds of ideas?
Do you remember too?

1164
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,110
Is that.

1165
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,040
Yeah,
I mean it's the same.

1166
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,800
So like we started the organization of 
black unity,

1167
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,960
this is one of the things that's the 
kind of the root of it.

1168
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,690
So we took,
literally took malcolm when he died,

1169
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,643
before he dies,
has a organization of afro american 

1170
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,254
unity as a constitution,
which nobody ever talks about it and it 

1171
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:54,630
says,
listen,

1172
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,010
this is what you should do.
And we said,

1173
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:56,910
okay,
let's do that.

1174
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,500
Let's just see what,
see if it works.

1175
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,970
And so we're working in birmingham to 
get to talk to people,

1176
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:02,430
would talk to young people,
older people.

1177
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,350
Uh,
we're in an early stage,

1178
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,273
but we know we're constantly having 
these conversations as like campus on 

1179
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:08,334
campus as well.
And you'll be probably not surprised 

1180
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,100
people relate to them.
People understand them.

1181
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,480
People get this.
This world doesn't,

1182
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,570
couldn't even provide for them.

1183
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,043
Yeah.
Because I suppose even if you don't 

1184
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,270
economic,
if you don't know it,

1185
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:23,230
we've knowledge as it were,
like a in terms of information.

1186
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:24,460
I mean if you don't know the 
information,

1187
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,400
somehow know it,
you know,

1188
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,280
in your gas.
There's something I think in people that

1189
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:30,330
resigns,
you know,

1190
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,460
when people talk a lot about political 
apathy,

1191
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,400
I think it's like it's not apathy.
Is it rational?

1192
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,293
Oh,
that's that

1193
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,210
dude.
We've participate in that.

1194
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,390
Yeah,
and people don't.

1195
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,020
We haven't given people the opportunity 
to be involved,

1196
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:45,390
particularly in radical politics and 
radical politics.

1197
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:46,224
I mean,
radical has become a bad word in 

1198
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:47,911
general,
right?

1199
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:50,800
We throw it around about islam and 
terrorism and etc.

1200
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,663
Etc.
But actually what we've done with this 

1201
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,530
is we've completely misunderstood what 
radical is.

1202
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:56,843
So radical islam and jihadism,
extremism and the complete opposite 

1203
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:04,080
things like completely not believable.
So extremism is when you take the,

1204
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,250
the basic premise of a society or an 
idea and you take it away forever,

1205
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:09,670
then it makes any sense of ticket,
right?

1206
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,793
That's ms dot.
That's what we're having with these 

1207
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:12,834
terrorists,
right?

1208
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,793
That's the same as nazis.
That's the same as christie 

1209
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:15,720
fundamentalist,
etc.

1210
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,390
And radIcalism is the opposite 
radicalism.

1211
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,670
You take the fundamentals and you reject
them.

1212
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,870
He said,
well actually I don't want these.

1213
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,510
I don't like this.
So you look at capitalism and you say,

1214
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,890
look,
now I'm going to be a market store.

1215
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:28,200
You look at going to be a radical and 
you rejected.

1216
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,423
So in a sense you can't actually have 
radical islam because radIcal islam 

1217
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,630
would cease to be islam.
Just wouldn't be,

1218
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,483
would be something else.
So we've completely conflate extremism 

1219
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,500
and radicalism and made radical a dirty 
word.

1220
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,240
We actually radical.
That's where we need to be.

1221
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,370
That's where we need to be pushing 
people toward.

1222
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,383
That wasn't a coincidence then you think
that that word has been deliberately 

1223
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:49,870
tarnished because if you think,
um,

1224
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,490
what's 50 only 50 years ago?
See,

1225
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,900
late sixties,
it wasn't.

1226
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,003
People really underestimate that.
The fact that we were on the precipice 

1227
00:54:58,981 --> 00:54:59,814
of global revolution,
I mean really if you think of communism 

1228
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,120
in the east african continent is massive
politics there.

1229
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,810
South America,
there was a,

1230
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,793
there was a moment where I look like the
west may not with the maintenance of 

1231
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:10,764
life.
And since then they have this literally 

1232
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:15,780
destroyed with both violence,
physical violence,

1233
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,960
and also symbolic violence,
uh,

1234
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,063
destroyed radicalism.
So they told us that radicalism is Bad 

1235
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:23,460
relative to the wrong radicalism is 
violent.

1236
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:24,294
Radicalism is all these things and 
pushed us away from those radical 

1237
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:27,054
movements.
But really radical movements are the 

1238
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,520
solution to these,
to these problems.

1239
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,110
The only solution to these problems.

1240
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,170
Can we criticize some contemporary 
figures and you've got some,

1241
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:39,800
lIke a proper,
a provocative quotes and stuff.

1242
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,900
Eg,
what about that theresa may's worse than

1243
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:42,760
Donald Trump?
That's

1244
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,550
was that provocative.
Mostly it was illogical packet for us.

1245
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,720
Well,
and again,

1246
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,060
I say quote medical lady said elisha,
like literally,

1247
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:53,030
I just quote medical books.
I do call other people as well,

1248
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:56,400
but he always used to come up that came 
from a paper.

1249
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:58,530
I've just really literally in a book 
about,

1250
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:02,120
um,
malcolm distinguish between the southern

1251
00:56:02,121 --> 00:56:02,954
wolf who is kind of bare their teeth and
a very aggressive and very Openly 

1252
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:06,924
racist.
You got to know there the problem 

1253
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:10,560
because they're banging on your head and
they'll shoot you,

1254
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:11,394
et cetera.
But he actually says that worse in the 

1255
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:16,320
southern wolf is the northern fox who's 
the tricky,

1256
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:17,730
who's counting,
who tell you,

1257
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,380
tell you everything's fine in this 
whisper.

1258
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:21,750
Sweet nothings into your ear,
but really they're just as bad.

1259
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,860
And if you think about racism at the 
time,

1260
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,500
uh,
in America and the civil rights movement

1261
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,360
is all about the south and it was about,
you know,

1262
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,190
the southern wolf was about segregation.

1263
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:30,881
It was a bad,
let's,

1264
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:33,850
let's,
let's get rid of this overt racism,

1265
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,163
but any of the north,
we know you haven't got legal 

1266
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:37,714
segregation is,
it's actually more segregated in the 

1267
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,800
north than it is in the sale.
And look at looking today.

1268
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,270
Nowadays,
look at the police killings.

1269
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,163
They usually in the know of another set 
of look at the ghetto that's often not 

1270
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:49,570
the same as well.
And so even though the north telling you

1271
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:50,404
all these wOnderful tales by,
so it's just as bad and in some ways 

1272
00:56:52,431 --> 00:56:53,264
it's worse than itself.
So this is the kind of thing I was 

1273
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,120
saying with the Theresa May.
Donald trump is very,

1274
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:01,360
very clearly openly white supremacist 
racist,

1275
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:03,330
obviously quite proud of it seemingly.

1276
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,470
Right,
like a white supremacist racism that was

1277
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:08,030
revealed with that charlottesville 
moment,

1278
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:09,470
or is there other stuff that

1279
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,093
historically,
in the nineties there was a big case in 

1280
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:14,770
central park where there was the,
um,

1281
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,280
there was a rape in central park and it,
and it was,

1282
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,620
it was pinned on a group of gang raid.
This,

1283
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,750
these african americans gangs were 
supposedly gang raped.

1284
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:23,970
This white woman complete lie,
a complete fabrication.

1285
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,790
Who was there trump champion this myth,
Donald Trump.

1286
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:29,130
But Donald Trump was there,
one of the worst offenders in this,

1287
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,870
uh,
central park five rape case.

1288
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,123
Then you've got barack obama is not 
american who was championing Donald 

1289
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,700
Trump.
Donald trump was hugely proud of that.

1290
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,760
And now you've got the muslim band,
you've got charlottesville,

1291
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:45,540
you've got all these,
look at it as very racist.

1292
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,710
And he just raises historically,
directly personally listened.

1293
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:50,544
I'll be surprised,
but Theresa May has tried to clothe 

1294
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:56,720
herself and being,
um,

1295
00:57:56,721 --> 00:57:58,230
you know,
so when she was home secretary,

1296
00:57:58,231 --> 00:57:59,160
she was,
um,

1297
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,190
the police stop and search.

1298
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,053
She ordered a review into stop and 
search and just the other day she had 

1299
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:09,030
all the race antiracist campaigners in 
her office around this.

1300
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,240
Um,
let's look,

1301
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,133
talk about racism.
Let's tell you the stats that I could 

1302
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,190
have told you the day before,
but anyway,

1303
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,680
we're going to have a big parade about 
how bad the countries.

1304
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,830
He likes to pretend that she's,
she's good on race,

1305
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,753
but she's terrible.
I mean she's as home secretary and if 

1306
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:24,924
you look at the policy around migration 
visas for people from african countries 

1307
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,680
denying people enter into the country 
letting.

1308
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,543
I mean,
she literally had a policy that said 

1309
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:34,523
we're not going to send boats into the 
mediterranean to save brown and black 

1310
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:40,170
people were just going to let them drain
to deter other people from coming.

1311
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,890
I mean,
that's a dead negro policy.

1312
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:43,440
It's what she's basically saying.
All right.

1313
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,500
So if you look at government policy,
look at what she's done.

1314
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,293
She's terrible and race,
but she presents herself as being 

1315
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,430
someone you can talk to,
someone you can relate to.

1316
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,980
That's the northern route,
which is more dangerous,

1317
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,791
right?
Yeah.

1318
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:59,280
I feel that that's correct.
I like that,

1319
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:02,340
um,
as a slogan that stop over racism,

1320
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,370
overt racism,
overt racism,

1321
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:13,610
overt racism out of football.
I've been mapping my subtle racism now,

1322
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:19,290
but they're covert structural stuff.
There's crafty racism.

1323
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,770
I'm like,
so the donald argument,

1324
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,170
they something like,
gosh,

1325
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,200
is it not an easy argument for a white 
person or an english person to make?

1326
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,880
And I'm both of those things.
You only one of them.

1327
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:32,920
So like,
uh,

1328
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,920
is this something to be said?
The,

1329
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:35,481
the,
the,

1330
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:36,314
the grotesque amplification at the trump
represents the seven wolf argument that 

1331
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:43,394
there was something beneficial in that.
It's an honor ignorable hideous 

1332
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,700
carbuncle mr.
Oh my god.

1333
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,220
We're now confronted with what our 
society means.

1334
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,260
Whereas as long as you had,
as you said,

1335
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,094
there was a different kind of violence 
immeshed in barack obama in the 

1336
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,290
concealment and the apparent book.
See,

1337
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,990
we've got a black president,
but you know,

1338
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,183
do,
do you think that there is something 

1339
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,300
depending on where it leads to almost,
if not positive,

1340
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,570
cathartic about.

1341
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,090
Yeah,
I say it might sound controversial,

1342
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:14,640
but I'd rather have Donald Trump as a 
president than barack obama.

1343
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,691
Honestly,
I mean,

1344
01:00:15,691 --> 01:00:18,090
really in terms of racial issues,
it's just clear,

1345
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:18,924
it's obvious is it tells you exactly 
what you need to know about this 

1346
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:24,600
society,
whereas a bomb was fronting is making it

1347
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:25,740
seem like it's something,
it's not.

1348
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,250
And so if you look at the,
uh,

1349
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,770
the protests,
you look at the movements,

1350
01:00:28,771 --> 01:00:29,604
look,
people get angry about things that's 

1351
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,700
there now in a way.
It wasn't necessarily the,

1352
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,050
I mean,
it's not like he wasn't there completely

1353
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,270
in black lives matter emerges under 
obama,

1354
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,250
partly becaUse I think people will,
like,

1355
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,350
we've got a black president in,
shouldn't we expect a bit more?

1356
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,243
yes.
But I think if you look now who look at 

1357
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:44,910
definitely the rhetoric around America 
is racist.

1358
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:45,990
This is problem.
Did it at a.

1359
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,480
I think you've seen that comeback more 
and that's what we need.

1360
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,580
That's the starting point for the kind 
of politics that we need.

1361
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:51,803
Donald trump,

1362
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,670
hero of african american.

1363
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,833
Uh,
I will,

1364
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,590
I won't go that far but,
but yeah,

1365
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:01,443
bad precedent for hours I always say at.
I'll put it on record with Donald Trump 

1366
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:05,580
is the president of black America than 
barack obama.

1367
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:06,763
Wow.
That's cool because like the thing that 

1368
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,970
seemed sort of where that appeals to me 
is that the,

1369
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:11,804
I think,
and this is obviously a personal thing 

1370
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:16,640
as opposed to a cultural thing for me,
is I don't like bullshit.

1371
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,830
I don't like the feeling that we're not 
actually dealing with the problem.

1372
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,693
It's always made me feel uncomfortable 
and it's made me want to tip over 

1373
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:27,740
tables.
It's made me want to be explosive and to

1374
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:32,510
sort of release a kind of romantic 
volatility into the atmosphere because I

1375
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:33,344
feel like no,
this isn't real and it's something that 

1376
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,650
was a person or it comes from a personal
experience,

1377
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,630
but perhaps there isn't no distinction 
between personal,

1378
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:39,464
political experiences on some level.
I felt as a kid there's something ain't 

1379
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:46,100
right and at score for this isn't right.
Like that filled that truth is not being

1380
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:49,220
conveyed on a very sort of practical 
level.

1381
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,053
What will that.
While I was at school feeling like I 

1382
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:55,050
don't feel like this is a beneficial 
experience that I'm having.

1383
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,270
I'd like an interest in my little belly,
so like I would at least like,

1384
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:00,071
yeah,
like I sort of like,

1385
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:00,350
oh,
right,

1386
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,800
these geezers and also in it,
like as the president now,

1387
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:04,221
right?
Oh,

1388
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,250
I get it now.
See now pro power isn't pretending to be

1389
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:10,040
your friend anymore and I don't see how 
any,

1390
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,400
the only sense of attachment or 
connection or ajit,

1391
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,540
ajit,
uh,

1392
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,660
um,
affection.

1393
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:16,130
Anyone could have a.
Donald trump will be like,

1394
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,023
that guy looks like how I feel kind of,
I feel angry and I don't like life and 

1395
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,300
he looks like that feeling as a 
president.

1396
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:25,134
So you know,
like I can't imagine how anyone could 

1397
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:26,964
have any real,
legitimate sense of allegiance that you 

1398
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:29,441
feel like,
well,

1399
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:30,810
what do you feel like with that 
charlottesville?

1400
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,960
Do you feel like,
ah,

1401
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,470
I suppose you don't feel like it's your 
problem.

1402
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,000
But sometimes when I feel like,
um,

1403
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:36,834
when like white people are marching 
around with tiki torches in 

1404
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:39,564
charlottesville or wherever it's about 
statue or something that seems to sort 

1405
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,173
of really sort of know necessarily in 
literally abstract in fact that is 

1406
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:45,864
dealing with a symbol a lot.
Like your life will not get better if 

1407
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:50,484
you pursue your argument to it's natural
conclusion of repatriation or wherever 

1408
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,180
easily into your personal life will not 
improve.

1409
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,193
How do you.
Do you not consider that to be part of 

1410
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,870
the argument that is required by like 
say black community?

1411
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,270
Do you see it much more focusing on 
creating solidarity?

1412
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:09,530
Yes.

1413
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,560
Well no.
I mean this is the,

1414
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,480
the counter argument to the,
to the whiteness stuff,

1415
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,523
unless you look at them,
probably a chunk of the people in 

1416
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,374
charlottesville,
a number of the people who voted for 

1417
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,600
Donald Trump,
white people,

1418
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:22,650
they're not really getting anything out 
of voting for Donald Trump to get rid of

1419
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:23,484
your healthcare.
Whoever made these crazy decisions all 

1420
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:29,100
the time to actually vulgar with things 
which make their situation worse,

1421
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,023
much worse.
Right.

1422
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,910
And I guess that's the kind of 
counterargument to this whiteness thing.

1423
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,230
If you could tell people,
listen,

1424
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,840
if they could understand these and maybe
they would actually,

1425
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:39,380
their interests will be better served 
with the big.

1426
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,910
A lot of people with everybody else,
right?

1427
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,830
With a different kind of politics are 
there.

1428
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:43,843
The thing that I've felt for a little 
while is that the way that power 

1429
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:46,964
operates is there must be a strata of 
people in institutions for whom the way 

1430
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:53,290
that systems operate are not problematic
for,

1431
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,280
for whom the systems are functioning 
correctly.

1432
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,010
There's a struggle going,
no,

1433
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,280
there is no problem because this is 
perfect.

1434
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,500
This is doing what it's meant to do.
Then.

1435
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:01,160
Right.
And I sort of think,

1436
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:01,551
oh,
okay,

1437
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:02,384
I'm not in that.
Then there's another one that's a 

1438
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:04,154
privileged elite that whether it's like 
for someone like me this from an 

1439
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:08,000
entertainment background that's like,
oh,

1440
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,360
I'm pretty cool.
I'm greg over.

1441
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,243
I want to do,
I want as long as I don't rock the boat 

1442
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,170
as I found out when I did it,
but I agree.

1443
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,293
And like,
um,

1444
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,373
and then beyond that,
it's just various degrees of fucked 

1445
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:21,140
going down and down and down to you've 
got nothing,

1446
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,080
you know?
And if it isn't part of the problem that

1447
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:26,600
people that they,
it's very difficult that once your,

1448
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,453
you know,
both of us in our way and now included 

1449
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,720
in culture in a way like,
well that's pretty good.

1450
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:35,910
We've got status power so that most 
people go,

1451
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:36,744
oh,
I don't see him as batman and find it 

1452
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,280
hard to,
you know.

1453
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,580
What was that thing you said about 
privilege,

1454
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,120
privilege,
privilege,

1455
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:44,954
yet?

1456
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,550
Yes.
I think this is.

1457
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,384
This is part of the pump.
I think also it's really important to 

1458
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:51,214
think about when you say it as those 
layers of people who it's not a problem 

1459
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:54,883
for.
I would extend that to more people than 

1460
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,750
probably most people would extend that 
to.

1461
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,080
I think that's important,
right?

1462
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:01,803
Even the poorest person in this country 
doesn't deal with child death really on 

1463
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:05,171
a daily basis.
It doesn't,

1464
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:06,004
doesn't have those exclusions and so 
they may have problems and they may be 

1465
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,154
huge problems of inequality,
but with the politics that we're 

1466
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:12,964
mobilizing,
are we just trying to make it a bit 

1467
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:15,274
better for people here or are we trying 
to make it better for everybody and I 

1468
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:19,060
think there is a consensus.
You could come to say,

1469
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:21,040
well look,
you have a bit of rich little bit pulled

1470
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:21,903
out,
will equal arabic and everybody will be 

1471
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,274
perfectly happy,
but it wouldn't solve the problem for 

1472
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:27,010
child death in public yet.
so.

1473
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,300
Great.
I agree.

1474
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:32,260
And I must be taught to care hindi 
though.

1475
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,200
They,
that,

1476
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,760
that argument can be made from the right
to demotivate people.

1477
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,980
I think that even the poorest people in 
this country,

1478
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,814
you're doing all right.
At least you're not dealing with some 

1479
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,630
bad kid in a mine.
And they're like,

1480
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,140
I need more say steve,
what was it?

1481
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:48,610
What,
what do you think being an educator,

1482
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,740
what do you think are the obligations 
from,

1483
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,780
uh,
from their perspective of education?

1484
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:53,614
What should we be being taught the 
reality of colonialism and imperialism 

1485
01:05:56,771 --> 01:05:58,270
with that?
What impact would that have?

1486
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,091
Um,
I mean,

1487
01:05:59,091 --> 01:06:00,230
I think that's important.
So what,

1488
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,940
what is the reality like?
What is,

1489
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,560
I mean you think about empire and think 
about we,

1490
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,463
the people don't know,
you can't judge people for what they 

1491
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:08,740
don't know.
And unfortunately we don't know.

1492
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,510
That system is terrible at telling us 
things which are really important.

1493
01:06:11,511 --> 01:06:14,480
So I think teaching about empire,
just teach just that if you just say,

1494
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:15,323
well,
let's teach an honest account of where 

1495
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:17,034
did britain gates will from where it is 
brain sustain his wealth to date and 

1496
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,360
understand how the global system works 
and how the global system privileges us.

1497
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,970
I think if you could just eat that,
that will be a starting point,

1498
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,250
but then it will be.
But I think it's a bit more than that.

1499
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,750
So for example,
with the black studies degree,

1500
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:30,830
uh,
that we started,

1501
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,500
we have these arguments,
but then we put them into practice.

1502
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,190
So they said,
well,

1503
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,140
what are you going to do about it?
How are you going to mobilize?

1504
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:38,030
What does that mean to how you act in 
the community?

1505
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,250
How do you as an actor,
as an academic,

1506
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,990
I can just be an academic.
I have to be an activist.

1507
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,490
They have to be a member of the 
community,

1508
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,563
have to be building these organizations 
and doing this work and really teaching 

1509
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:49,280
people that they have a responsibility 
to make this better.

1510
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:53,330
The he kind of is a comment on us with 
the privilege to make things better.

1511
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,283
I think that's important as well.

1512
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,343
Both of those things are important.
The first part it seems like I can 

1513
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:59,080
imagine that feeling like a kind of 
heresy,

1514
01:06:59,110 --> 01:06:59,943
which makes me recognize again how 
arbitrary the distinction between what 

1515
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:04,324
you call one course,
the religious and what one calls the 

1516
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:06,994
political,
how that line is arbitrary because if 

1517
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:09,870
you are in a school guy,
right?

1518
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,270
This is what british empire is with that
nice in depth analysis in africa.

1519
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,183
We've done that in Ireland and the 
outcome you can have your coco pops 

1520
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,970
enjoy lunch and I was like,
no,

1521
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:23,290
don't say that.
It's going to ruin everyone's morale.

1522
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,820
It's sports day tomorrow,
right?

1523
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,030
That's the first thing I'm going to say,
and with that black studies course,

1524
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:31,630
how's it going and how many people were 
on it and is it all black people?

1525
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,700
Yeah,
so he's going,

1526
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:35,350
well first year we've got about 20 
students,

1527
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:38,360
which is what we expected to get without
a target to get a.

1528
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,570
It is actually usable by people for the 
first time.

1529
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,520
I'm sure in America,
african american studies is lies.

1530
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,820
Lots of white people,
asian people.

1531
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,460
It takes a while to.
To the stuff?

1532
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,850
Yeah.
What about that woman that felt like she

1533
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:53,690
was black in that?
do you remember that story?

1534
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,520
Which one is an idea?
So I feel like I'm black actually.

1535
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:01,590
So like what does that,
what did we go with that?

1536
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:02,653
Is that interesting?
Because I was a duke university didn't 

1537
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:07,960
mind it may or something and I was 
giving a talk about blackness,

1538
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:08,794
citrus,
citrus and african american studies 

1539
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:12,430
department and somebody turned around 
and said,

1540
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:13,264
well actually the way you're talking 
about blackness being this political 

1541
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,190
concept stage,
was it true?

1542
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:19,700
Doesn't that mean rachel dolezal is 
black?

1543
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,803
And I was shocked.
I mean I couldn't believe it because 

1544
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:25,040
african american studies.
I thought it had been a bit more nuance

1545
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,840
that's not really covered the basics,

1546
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:37,570
but I think if somebody like that,
I mean if you're taking.

1547
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,090
If,
if,

1548
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,720
if I'm,
if my argument is that right,

1549
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:40,963
the

1550
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,090
color of my skin is important because of
the history of it in work it tells about

1551
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,860
me and what it tells me about the 
connections into.

1552
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,760
Then you quite just faked it like you 
guys make that up life.

1553
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:49,603
That's the thing that unites you 
politically then to try to pretend to 

1554
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,840
complete not only destroyed any concept 
of unity sense,

1555
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:00,230
so it's utterly offensive,
but I wouldn't ever get really mad about

1556
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,790
this because you probably just got 
mental health problems.

1557
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:02,683
I mean real,
real level.

1558
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,970
I wanting to be black later,
really want to be black.

1559
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:05,804
What is that?
That takes a particular distorted view 

1560
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:08,920
of the world.

1561
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,380
I liked the music in the edge,
not so keen on the slavery.

1562
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,381
Yeah,
I see.

1563
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:15,214
That's interesting because identity 
politics can become very divisive in as 

1564
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:19,894
well as creating great cohesion and 
momentum and this is a moment I feel 

1565
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:28,420
around these kinds of ideas and I 
suppose as a white male,

1566
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,313
I'm uniquely qualified to pontificate on
all facets of that guy and that was an 

1567
01:09:35,231 --> 01:09:37,030
amazing interview.
I really,

1568
01:09:37,031 --> 01:09:41,200
really enjoyed it.
I feel properly like educated on a broad

1569
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:42,034
area of topics.
Plus we got stuck in with some real 

1570
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:45,094
populism.
I think notably the moment of Donald 

1571
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,470
Trump is a bad precedent for black 
american and barack obama.

1572
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,600
That some radicalism,
right?

1573
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,940
Hopefully people will put.
People's.

1574
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:54,774
Mothers will put a picture of donald.
Donald trump won the war after I said 

1575
01:09:56,851 --> 01:09:57,684
that.
That's what your mom cried when Donald 

1576
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,270
Trump becomes president.
He's going to cry with.

1577
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,143
Listen to this.

1578
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,390
Nice one.
Thanks mate.

1579
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,653
Cheers.
