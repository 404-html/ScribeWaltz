1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,570
My guess,
lot of the skin today,

2
00:00:01,571 --> 00:00:02,404
our Huron on and Henna gracie brothers 
and part of Jujitsu's most illustrious 

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:06,994
family as sons.
The holly on Gracie known worldwide for 

4
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:11,164
creating the UFC as a way to bring his 
family's Jujitsu style to the attention 

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:15,724
of America's masses here on and hen air 
have continued to perpetuate their 

6
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:24,391
father's legacy while carving out their 
own name in the Jujitsu family tree.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,740
This includes taking Bjj into the 
technological age by founding the online

8
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:30,574
gracie university,
the first interactive distance learning 

9
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:37,390
center for Brazilian Jujitsu,
boasting more than 100,000

10
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:42,391
students in over 196 countries.
The hugely popular unknown online show,

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,163
the gracie breakdown.
There's also seen them amass large 

12
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,690
numbers of viewers for their mixed 
martial arts commentaries.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,943
Welcome to under the skin here on and 
hand and walk them through our house 

14
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:58,900
man,
because here we are in your home stadium

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,130
in tolerance.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,200
Could you?
I'm very grateful of being here.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,050
I've like.
So the people at home know,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,513
I've been trained training mostly with 
here on for just a one week for five 

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,433
little five hour long sessions.
And the thing that fascinates me most 

20
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:15,784
about Brazilian Jujitsu,
people that are fans of martial arts 

21
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:21,100
will be aware of its efficacy of its 
power.

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,550
People that know your family and your 
online work.

23
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,384
We'll know that there is a sort of a 
peculiar component to what you do as a 

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,720
marketer martial art,
which I've been particularly struck by a

25
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:36,310
kind of openness and a kind of warmth 
and a kind of love.

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,173
There was something about it that 
surprises me a great deal to start this 

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,033
conversation.
Could you explain to me a little about 

28
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,920
Helio Gracie and the foundation of what 
is known as Gracie Jujitsu,

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,820
maybe racy or grandfather for those who 
don't know.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,900
Um,
first,

31
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,490
thanks for being here.
This is awesome for us.

32
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,324
We were delighted to get the call that 
you were here and one of the train 

33
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,520
Jujitsu and for our viewing audience out
there and our listening audience,

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,453
um,
Russell has only had a little bit of 

35
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,064
training here with us in California,
but he is training in the UK and has 

36
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,904
been consistent for a little while.
So it's always beautiful when Jujitsu 

37
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,440
has another,
you know,

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,373
influential figure like yourself,
join the family and be able to 

39
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,030
perpetuate the amazingness of what we 
were so lucky to grow up with,

40
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,810
especially someone that's so good at 
Jujitsu as I am.

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,170
But they laughed.
They laugh.

42
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,540
Listen,
do you have all the attributes?

43
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,374
You've got the legs for the triangle 
chokes and you've been incredibly 

44
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,080
dedicated.
Um,

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
but in terms of what you said about,
you know,

46
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,200
the warmth and the amazingness of 
Jujitsu,

47
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,100
while you were saying that,
I'm like,

48
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,890
wow,
it makes sense that it's kind of a shock

49
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,083
to someone who gets involved in a 
fighting art to be received with the 

50
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,320
warmth and the gentility and the,
the,

51
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:45,600
the beauty of what is the Gracie Jiu 
Jitsu,

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,493
something that you might not have 
associated with it before you kind of 

53
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,590
ventured into this,
this,

54
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:50,960
this,
this art as,

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,610
as you begin and,
and you're absolutely right then that we

56
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,870
can trace that back to our grandfather.
But really the core of what Jujitsu is,

57
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,060
right.
Um,

58
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,943
Jujitsu is the most gentle martial art 
on the planet and self defense system 

59
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,954
while also being the most effective.
So we have the ability to not only 

60
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,274
defend ourselves against an attacker,
but if we have to defend ourselves 

61
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,470
against someone,
they're not going to get hurt.

62
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,640
They're going to be okay.

63
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,173
What do you think it was in particular 
about your grandfather that meant that 

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,300
Jujitsu,
as he evolved through your family,

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,800
has maintained this kind of gentleness?
What was it about him as a man?

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,170
Our grandfather was very frail,
very light,

67
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,004
very small as whole life.
So he had to be the most technical 

68
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:38,670
person in the room and because he was so
technical,

69
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,220
naturally he can't rely on his physical 
attributes.

70
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,900
He can't go out there and beat people 
up.

71
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,730
So the gentility I think started there.
If he was six [inaudible] three,

72
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,623
225 pounds,
maybe it wouldn't have been a gentle 

73
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,014
experience for you this week,
but the fact that he was as small as he 

74
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,130
was it,
we kind of continued,

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,800
you know,
what he was so passionate about,

76
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,120
which was being technical

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,703
inception of Jujitsu.
The idea that disadvantages can become 

78
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,473
advantages be seeded in it.
The idea that something that would be 

79
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:11,940
considered a disadvantage,
being frail,

80
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,803
being small,
these things can be turned to an 

81
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:15,834
advantage.
That for me already seems like an 

82
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:20,640
interesting philosophical point,
but as well as being like,

83
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,380
of course a uh,
you know,

84
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,710
I love all the gentleness and the warm 
for Nada,

85
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,830
but this is not the,
the origins of this are in Brazil.

86
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,990
There's a lot of conflict,
a lot of combat,

87
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:34,140
a lot of honor,
a lot of your grandfather demonstrate in

88
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,880
the effectiveness of these principles 
in,

89
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,010
you know,
fights.

90
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,340
And just tell us a bit about that.

91
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,070
You know,
that's Kinda how the West was won.

92
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,660
It was these challenge matches,
right?

93
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:43,494
So if you do Jujitsu,
and this guy over here does karate and 

94
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:49,560
both think they are the most effective 
martial arts on the planet,

95
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,240
you have to fight to see which one is 
more effective.

96
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,093
We have to have a debate.
A debate when it comes to martial arts 

97
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,690
is basically a fight.
It's a conversation and they're,

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,290
they're done in a spirit of education 
and the spirit of exploration.

99
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,470
Our grandfather never considered himself
a professional fighter,

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,690
like a prize fighter like you see today 
with the,

101
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,120
you know,
the UFC and professional boxers.

102
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,280
He didn't do it for the sport of it or 
even for the money of it.

103
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,143
Our grandfather was a teacher of Jujitsu
who fought other people in no rules 

104
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:21,330
settings to prove that did you through 
he was teaching was effective.

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,640
That was his demonstration of his 
effectiveness.

106
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,723
Do you see the difference?
Whereas someone else might just fight 

107
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,350
for the sake of getting paid or the fame
of it.

108
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,213
Our grandfather fought because he 
believed what he was teaching was 

109
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,430
effective and how else could he prove 
it.

110
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,530
Then by choking someone out who was much
larger,

111
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,030
much heavier and much more athletic than
him,

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,090
must have had phenomenal drive.
Nonetheless.

113
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:39,990
This,
it must've been,

114
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,853
this is a man that had a personal 
mission because to take a Jujitsu from 

115
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,300
where it was in what the 1920s is that 
right?

116
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,051
Yeah.
23rd is,

117
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,000
yeah,
where it is today.

118
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:56,001
Of course his sons and your generation.
I've also contributed incredibly to this

119
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,504
transition.
We'll get to the UFC and that kind of 

120
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:02,150
stuff and your father's work with that,
but like what do you think,

121
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,930
what do you think drove him?
What made him want to do all that?

122
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,930
He,
you know,

123
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,770
he always tells the stories about what 
you do.

124
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,890
Two did for him,
right when he was a very young teenager.

125
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:17,460
And he started learning these techniques
and how much it helped him,

126
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,680
how he could barely run up a flight of 
stairs.

127
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,640
And he was not athletic at all.
He starts learning Jujitsu from watching

128
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:25,530
and before you know what he's teaching 
you in a little bit.

129
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:30,531
And now he's on the mat teaching a lot.
So jujitsu made took him from this frail

130
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:35,640
little kid to a superhero to Brazil is 
first national sports hero.

131
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,200
So if Jujitsu did so much for him,
he feels like,

132
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,034
you know what?
He felt like I had to show us with the 

133
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,254
rest of the world.
How can I not give this if it saved my 

134
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,240
life?
So it began his selfish.

135
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,330
It began as I'm doing this right now 
because I'm a little skinny little white

136
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:51,750
kid.

137
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,120
I needed,
I need this for myself for survival.

138
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:54,954
It began with that,
but it ended with service and now he's 

139
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,690
affected just by his actions and those 
of his kind of,

140
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,381
uh,
his,

141
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,011
his,
his,

142
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,840
you know,
his future generations.

143
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,190
Um,
his successors,

144
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,480
I should say,
uh,

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,433
that the whole world martial arts will 
never be the same and can never be 

146
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,750
undone for the work that that little guy
did in Brazil.

147
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,390
And then of course the family bringing 
into America and our whole lives.

148
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,640
He always said,
you guys Jujitsu,

149
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,130
anybody can do Jujitsu.
It's for anybody.

150
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,700
But like you said,
this is a very gentle place and you were

151
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:24,534
a little bit surprised as to how 
pleasant it was here at Grace 

152
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,980
University.
People often think like,

153
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,900
ah,
I don't of Jujitsu is for me.

154
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:31,561
I don't know.
I don't know.

155
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,000
But any grace he thought,
no,

156
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:35,190
there's no doubt Jujitsu is for you.

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,420
It's for you,
for you,

158
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,171
for you,
for you,

159
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,590
for you.
And he knew that because it was for him.

160
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,150
And if he could do it,
sure.

161
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,340
Being who he was,
of course you can do,

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,313
he is the lowest common denominator.
And if he could do it and grow the way 

163
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,970
he did and no one is exempt from the 
learning process and the growing process

164
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,971
and also what he believed you had to do 
to do Jujitsu was very little.

165
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,890
Somebody might think that Jujitsu is,
you know,

166
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,903
rush.
Somebody overwhelmed them with punches 

167
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,094
and take them down and arm bar them.
He to him Jujitsu is simply managing 

168
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:08,970
distance,
good communication,

169
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,280
talking to the person down,
who knows.

170
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,100
It could be a little bit of heat up,
not getting punched in the face,

171
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,470
not getting a headlock,
just simply surviving.

172
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:17,304
Just things safe for two or three 
minutes until somebody breaks the fight 

173
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:20,484
up.
You just did amazing Jujitsu and who 

174
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:22,524
can't use that.

175
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,433
He had a personal mission.
The innocence is comparable to other 

176
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,470
way.
A lot of people feel about spirituality,

177
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,110
like people that have experienced 
enlightenment.

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,040
They think I've got to share this 
message with the world or perhaps myself

179
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:40,330
with recovery from drugs and alcohol.
I have a sort of a comparable sense of,

180
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,070
oh,
I want to help other people with this.

181
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,300
I want people,
I want to,

182
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,150
I feel an obligation that if I can do 
this,

183
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,970
other people can do it.
Uh,

184
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,280
it's interesting that that at the point 
where uh,

185
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,880
this art was conceived,
it was about someone that,

186
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,220
uh,
you know,

187
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,054
that they were in,
were vulnerable on inefficient or even 

188
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,720
as you have said,
like so smaller,

189
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,900
weaker guy.
Uh,

190
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,823
like now this is something that's still 
relevant to me learning it because like 

191
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,070
as we have discussed when I've been 
having the personal sessions,

192
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:08,904
it's like for me it's about access in an
aspect of myself that I'm not being 

193
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,673
comfortable accessing before.
It seems important that within this 

194
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,434
forum that you're super efficient.
It could be seen as being about 

195
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,370
strength,
domination,

196
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,560
control,
vulnerability.

197
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,603
Is there a significant aspect of it?
Peculiar that that's continued now and 

198
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,350
we talk a lot about how the,

199
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,293
the more you learn,
the more you realize how much you don't 

200
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,360
know.
Yeah,

201
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,420
I should very,
so the vulnerability,

202
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:40,760
the moment you step on this mat in this 
room,

203
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:41,840
you're,
you're very vulnerable.

204
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,273
Which is why I guess everybody in the 
world is not walking into a Jujitsu 

205
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,430
school because they fear,
you know,

206
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:52,070
maybe being embarrassed or being injured
or being,

207
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,510
you know,
overpowered.

208
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,460
So the,
the vulnerability,

209
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,294
it takes a lot to come in here.
And once you do come in here and start 

210
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:02,060
to really work on that feeling of 
vulnerability,

211
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,410
they think the possibilities are 
endless.

212
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,630
And with you in particular as you're 
learning that the,

213
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,570
what we felt is that we'll show you a 
technique and let's see,

214
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:09,404
a technique only requires 10% of your 
strength and energy in that particular 

215
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,300
situation.
As someone who's newer to Jujitsu,

216
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,243
you do what most the everyone does,
which is you put 100% of your strength 

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,810
to accomplish something that only 
requires 10% of your strength.

218
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,030
And we laugh about it,
but it's true.

219
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,320
And then when you get in those 
positions,

220
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,660
you realize that,
and you even said this to me,

221
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,110
you said,
man,

222
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,943
I'm,
I'm overreacting to the threat stimulus 

223
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,540
here because that's all I've ever done 
my whole life.

224
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
It's when there's a threat or an 
uncertain too,

225
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,470
I'm uncomfortable or it's it's fight or 
flight,

226
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,410
I fight,
you know,

227
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,130
I go 100% in response to it.
And um,

228
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,993
and I think that you're making a lot of 
discovery for yourself as we're doing 

229
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:46,881
this and saying,
wow,

230
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:47,714
why am I death gripping him right now 
when he just told me that I can do it 

231
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:54,290
with 90% less energy and still be 
effective?

232
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,120
Why am I doing that?
Right.

233
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:57,740
And that's important to kind of reflect 
on,

234
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,461
well you,
you haven't,

235
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,940
he hasn't taken that technique into 
battle.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,690
It's true.
Not tested it enough to trust it like we

237
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:05,960
do.

238
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,793
I trust the move to where I can use 10% 
15% because I know what I believe in 

239
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:12,224
that move.
As much as I believe in anything in the 

240
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,290
world,
you just learned it yesterday.

241
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
You can't trust that move with your life
trust.

242
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,803
So you have to do it 17 1947300500 times
and then eventually and none of that 

243
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,870
with different levels of resistance.
And then eventually you're going to say,

244
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:27,704
you know what,
somebody is on top of me painting me to 

245
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,060
the ground.
This isn't a problem.

246
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,800
Life is great.
No problem.

247
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,960
You know why?
Because I have the trap and roll

248
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,253
because I tell you why,
and this is one of the things I learned 

249
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,570
from listening to you guys,
like fear.

250
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,520
It plays a part in me.
It like it.

251
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,354
It's a big part of my psychology.
Even though there's areas in my life 

252
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:49,290
where I feel very competent and 
confident,

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,240
still fear is very effective.
Now,

254
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,590
while I've been training with you guys 
this week,

255
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,424
I've been doing standup comedy gigs and 
I told you that even something that I'm 

256
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,990
very experienced in doing standup 
comedy,

257
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,123
you know,
I feel like,

258
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,660
I feel like it's my job almost to allow 
fear to come into me.

259
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,910
I respond to fear that if I'm not 
feeling frightened,

260
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm not doing it properly,
you know?

261
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,350
But because when I was talking to 
actually it was you that said,

262
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,184
hey,
I know that when you are on the green 

263
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,670
mat in a fire situation for you,
this is home.

264
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
And I was thinking stand up comedy.
That's my home.

265
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,810
I've been doing this a long,
long time,

266
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,480
so the next Gig I did before it,
I fought.

267
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,510
Right now this is my home going into 
this place.

268
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,420
It's natural that I feel these feelings 
of adrenaline.

269
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,470
It's not true that this energy is coming
into my body but I want to use it.

270
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,320
You said another thing about that guy,
I can't remember his exact name,

271
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,030
but maybe it was called dragon or 
something.

272
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,260
Yeah,
Leo Machida,

273
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,094
the Dragon [inaudible] you said that he 
says that a fight situation is too 

274
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,891
complex to predict the outcome or you 
can do is apply your personal fidelity.

275
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,540
Now this for me is a very spiritual 
situation,

276
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,160
so before the Gig I was thinking,
I don't know how this Gig,

277
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:55,360
he's going to go too many variables,
too much chaos.

278
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,390
All I know is if I stay connected to who
I am,

279
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,070
if I can observe it,
then I will be in a good position to lou

280
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,330
use my skills in that area.

281
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,193
I do have trust.
I do have trust days possible to for me 

282
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,094
to succeed by like in a new environment.
And one could say this is a very primal 

283
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,300
thing you're dealing with,
whether you're male or female.

284
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,193
Fear.
The idea that another human being can 

285
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,250
dominate you,
humiliate you,

286
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,860
use you.
This is a energy,

287
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,470
maybe even lizard energy.
This is energy,

288
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,460
this deep,
deep,

289
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:31,790
deep in the consciousness.
So these techniques I think are posses.

290
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,940
Changing consciousness is changing 
consciousness.

291
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,173
It's very important to,
we'll talk more of course about your 

292
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,260
family.
We'll talk more about the UFC,

293
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,140
but I'm very interested in the,
uh,

294
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,660
with this phase of the evolution of 
Gracie Jujitsu.

295
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,583
You're very interested in programs for 
bullying programs for female 

296
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:49,564
empowerment.
Would you like to talk to me a little 

297
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,180
bit about that stuff and why it's here?

298
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,920
Well,
that was a big deal for us.

299
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:54,754
Like we grew up in a family and in an 
era where everything was about proving 

300
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,400
Jujitsu's effectiveness.
So it was fights.

301
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:01,234
It was my dad created the UFC to show 
that Jujitsu is better than all the 

302
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,740
other martial arts and hoist went in 
there,

303
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:08,050
our uncle and did very well and put us 
on the map.

304
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:08,884
Essentially.
Our grandfather did all that previously 

305
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,014
in Brazil.
So this proving era was a very 

306
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,440
aggressive state of proving,
proving,

307
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:15,850
proving.
And it came off as,

308
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,130
you know,
as a,

309
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:17,770
as,
as,

310
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,603
as an era of just showing superiority.
But it was really demonstrating 

311
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:22,990
effectiveness so that students would 
say,

312
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,390
wow,
if I'm going to learn something,

313
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm going to learn what those,
you know,

314
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,110
skinny Brazilians are doing because I,
if I,

315
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,220
if they could do it,
so can I.

316
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,063
That was the goal there was to inspire 
the eagerness to learn that was 

317
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,044
accomplished and it basically nine 1993 
[inaudible] 94 95 and then since then 

318
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:42,730
it's been a known fact that it's,
your duty was the quintessential art for

319
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:43,360
mma.

320
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,193
So everyone kind of accepts that.
But where we are today and him and I 

321
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,630
coming up through that era and we were,
you know,

322
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:49,464
early teenagers when that was happening.
And then we had to mature through that 

323
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,244
and figure out what was going to be our 
calling and what was going to be our 

324
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,350
really our focus for the family.
What's our contribution to this legacy?

325
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,670
And the conclusion was the demand for 
Jujitsu was unprecedented.

326
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,504
The world wants to learn Jujitsu.
What didn't exist is structured 

327
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,123
distribution mechanisms to get Jujitsu 
from our family to the world in 

328
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,133
instructure demographic specific ways 
that would reach and penetrate all the 

329
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:20,870
necessary audiences so that everyone 
could benefit.

330
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:25,490
Because Teaching Jujitsu to a police 
officer who has to go arrest the suspect

331
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,750
nonviolently and keep his gun in his 
holster is different than teaching it to

332
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,910
a survivor of sexual assault.

333
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,983
And it's different than teaching it to a
kid who walks to school every day with 

334
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,300
his hand sweating because he doesn't 
know when that bolt is going to approach

335
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:41,240
him.
Every one of those needs Jujitsu but how

336
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,180
you communicate it to them is completely
different.

337
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,103
So what we are responsible for is the,
is the specialization of Jujitsu into 

338
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,670
demographics,
specific courses,

339
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,410
Gracie,
bulletproof for children,

340
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,930
Gracie survival tactics for law 
enforcement,

341
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,590
Gracie combatives for the everyday 
civilian who wants to learn self defense

342
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,440
men or women just in the least amount of
time possible.

343
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,630
Women in power to defend against sexual 
assault.

344
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,970
All of them are the based on the same 
principles,

345
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,740
same concept,
same techniques.

346
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,470
Our family has been perfecting for 
almost a hundred years,

347
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,573
but every single one of them is 
communicated completely differently to 

348
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,294
their audiences.
So that was really our biggest 

349
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,144
contribution and then putting that 
online so that all of that was 

350
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:25,520
accessible anywhere in the world through
gracie university.com

351
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,773
that's,
that's really cemented our contribution 

352
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,830
and now it's just growing and we have 
more,

353
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,380
more teaching to do.
But it's all in that thought of,

354
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,740
you know,
making it available for everyone.

355
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:37,270
Just literally Jujitsu for everyone.

356
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,703
Jujitsu then is a kind of a language,
even from my personal experience of 

357
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,120
Jujitsu prior with them.
They're excellent teachers.

358
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,030
I've had back in the UK at Genesis Jam.
I'll give him a little shout out cause I

359
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,260
love him,
Paul and Chris,

360
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,570
like what our thinking is.
Oh Wow.

361
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,460
This thing is like,
it's,

362
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,294
I feel like I'm a little kid saying the 
cat is on the mat while they're able to 

363
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,934
say,
this feline creature rests now for a 

364
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,720
moment on the math,
like watching them move,

365
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,790
watching the patterns,
the lucidness,

366
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,910
the vividness,
the beauty of the language now.

367
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,943
So the inception of a Jujitsu as we 
discuss it with respect to your 

368
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,160
grandfather was about,
first of all,

369
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,730
this is able to overcome my feelings of 
vulnerability and weakness.

370
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,713
Secondly,
this is the most effective form of 

371
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,180
combat against even other trained 
fighters.

372
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,133
And now what your personal mission has 
become as the heads of this part of the 

373
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:29,564
family is the heads of this journey is 
you want this language to be understood 

374
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,940
by people everywhere.
Yes,

375
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,823
100%

376
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,460
anybody who who you said walks this 
planet has insecurities.

377
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,080
All right.
Everybody's worried,

378
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,820
everybody's scared,
everybody's,

379
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,433
you know,
worried about their personal or the 

380
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:53,850
safety of their loved ones.
So there's going to be some time in your

381
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,860
life or something's going to happen when
that day comes.

382
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,110
We talk,
we can provide through digital that they

383
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,440
need to get through that hard time.
But it is literally different languages.

384
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,423
Russell,
for each audience communicating to a 

385
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,740
woman if,
if,

386
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,513
if you just speak to a woman who wants 
to learn for self defense and to defend 

387
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,004
against sexual assault,
Jujitsu in the conventional sense that 

388
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,690
night,
the conventional way that 99% of schools

389
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,524
out there,
teachers are too and you were to have 

390
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,160
her come in and just try a beginner 
class at a school,

391
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,203
she would see no immediate and direct 
application between the grappling idea 

392
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,084
of two people sweating on each other,
rolling around on the Mat and the 

393
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,080
potential for defend against sexual 
assault.

394
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,630
She would not see that connect.
Now is there a connection?

395
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:36,360
Yes,
but she would not see it.

396
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,343
So what we have literally done is 
created adapters to make the same 

397
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:45,120
principles communicatable to this 
person,

398
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,050
woman,
child,

399
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:47,640
cop,
anything that makes them say,

400
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,160
oh,
this is not only effective for me.

401
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,053
This was designed exclusively for me and
when you communicated that perfectly to 

402
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,540
a fragile,
intimidated,

403
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,510
uncertain beginner students,
you captivate,

404
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:04,920
then you engage them in the art too.
What would other have not wise happened?

405
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:05,754
Because you know if you speak to them 
with the normal communication language 

406
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:08,970
of Jujitsu and they go,
wow,

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,930
this is really kind of actually kind of,
it doesn't seem very fun,

408
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,620
effective.
I don't want to see how I would use this

409
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,890
in real life.
She's going to dismiss Jujitsu after her

410
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,690
first class and I say her,
but I mean,

411
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,070
I even mean men who go to a class and 
there are just not tough mma want to.

412
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,903
We've got fighters,
they're just normal civilians and they 

413
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,460
come into a class and they go,
wow,

414
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:28,350
this is freaking nuts.
What they're doing here.

415
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,273
It can be done.
Absolutely quite as all boils down to 

416
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,270
how it's communicated.
So the answer is yes,

417
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
everyone needs your Jitsu.
Everyone can benefit from Jujitsu,

418
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:39,030
but if you communicate it wrong,
it's a disaster.

419
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,353
This even even course to course,
like even within the beginner Gracie 

420
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,860
combatives course,
you have three new people on their first

421
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:47,430
day.
Yes.

422
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,370
Even those three have to be communicated
to differently.

423
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,910
That's how special is that 225 pound kid
that just came out of college,

424
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:54,744
you know,
playing football for three years in 

425
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,124
college and now you have somebody who's,
who works at Bank of America down the 

426
00:19:58,981 --> 00:19:59,814
street.
Those are two different people in the 

427
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,320
same class.
Perhaps energies.

428
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,650
How are you making these individual 
evaluations?

429
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,680
What signs are you reading of how a 
person needs to be taught and embraced?

430
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:13,974
What are things that are conveying,
we already know everything we need to 

431
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:17,504
know from the handshake.
The moment just from that we already 

432
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,140
know.
We already know that.

433
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,980
We all want to know.
So tell me then from that,

434
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,190
what is from that so tight,
that person to accept.

435
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,033
All right,
I get it.

436
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,610
Listen,
just from that highly energized,

437
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,533
overly eccentric,
potentially an actor and a comedian of 

438
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,070
sorts,
and you're coming here,

439
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,530
you're excited to be here,
but you're very nervous.

440
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,460
No,
listen,

441
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,770
I want to have that.
So you're excited to be here.

442
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,780
You've been waiting to learn this stuff 
your entire life.

443
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:45,850
So you're like getting more your 
information over.

444
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:47,830
Let's give it to this guy cause he's 
about it right now.

445
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,800
At the same time we can't be too excited
because he's also a very strong,

446
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,840
you can tell from his hands [inaudible] 
my hands,

447
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,100
my hands a little sore from that right 
now.

448
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,933
So quite tough.
So if we're too excited it might make 

449
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,630
him a low too excited.
He won't relax.

450
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,963
Rush to the,
which is what we're experiencing with 

451
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,070
you is that no matter how gently we 
teach you the moves,

452
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,080
you're over committing to their 
execution.

453
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,003
So our talk to you on the Mat as you've 
noticed has to have been overly 

454
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:09,844
compensating.
Yeah.

455
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Hey Ross,
look at this and we whispered,

456
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,870
you drink class and you're like,
wow,

457
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,670
why are they still relaxed?
We hope they'll try to bring you down.

458
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,563
We hope that your movements will match 
our whisper and then you'll become the 

459
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,620
Jujitsu whisper.
When did you learn those things?

460
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:26,454
Which these are,
these are psychological and amphora per 

461
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,500
logical skills.
These are not the,

462
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,040
they obviously clearly intersect with 
martial arts.

463
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,750
So when you're little kids with your 
father and your uncles,

464
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,520
and we'll have a family members were 
significant,

465
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:43,240
then how are you?

466
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,110
You being taught this stuff at the same 
time as you're being taught.

467
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:46,944
This is how to do a triangle.
Our grandfather always talked about how 

468
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,514
whenever he touches someone,
they start getting weak and he has this 

469
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,014
energy about him in his aura.
And what he meant was that if I put my 

470
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:02,640
hand on you and my hand is like this,
no matter how tense you are,

471
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,773
it's not going to take too long for you 
to also relax versus if I grab you 

472
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,530
squeezing,
it's going to make you 10 so when you're

473
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:14,040
fighting somebody,
it's to our benefit to fight somebody,

474
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:19,041
but find every moment we can to relax so
that we can bring their energy down.

475
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,210
We can calm them down,
make them feel safe and calm down.

476
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,050
Saint,
just a student like Russell,

477
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,940
you're talking about and we're fighting,
the opponent wants to kill you.

478
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm talking about it and how we,
and how we teach him the fight.

479
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:31,080
You're hypnotized.
The guy.

480
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,930
I'm soft to make him relax,
but where I'm fighting somebody,

481
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,540
I relax to make them go,
ah,

482
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,600
and then block he slices.
But to answer your question,

483
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:40,434
let's get back on the anthropological 
aspect of the connection and the 

484
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,293
connection.
Let's talk about this idea of where are 

485
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:50,550
we learn how to teach and connect.
Like let's be clear that the world knows

486
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:54,680
the Gracie family as a fighting family 
for a hundred years is 1920 oh you know,

487
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,523
it's almost a hundred years now.
That's what the world kind of seeds on 

488
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,550
the surface.
What we don't feel that way at all.

489
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,450
We feel that we're part of a teaching 
family for three generations,

490
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:06,780
almost a hundred years.
So as much refinement,

491
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,950
dedication,
obsession that has been dedicated to the

492
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:13,080
process of choking out other human 
beings.

493
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,510
That's been a very obsessive process for
the last 100 years.

494
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,673
As much as we've spent on that process 
in equal amount of time and energy has 

495
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:25,161
been spent on refining the ability to 
transfer our skill set to other people,

496
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,130
is that really true?
100% as much as you're saying,

497
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,020
I'll get right into the crook of the 
arm.

498
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:31,854
It's very important.
You're saying this is the best way to 

499
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:34,164
come in and you're 100% and that's why 
we are at the forefront of certifying 

500
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,183
other instructors around the world to do
the same things that we're doing and we 

501
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:45,030
have 150 schools today who are all 
certified to teach.

502
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,133
These curriculums were telling you about
not just the same techniques but 

503
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,084
communicated in the same way and in the 
same teaching methodology and that's an 

504
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,970
obsession of ours as much as the 
fighting itself,

505
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,670
it wouldn't have made sense for my 
grandfather,

506
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,930
fathers,
uncles,

507
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:00,764
cousins to choke everybody out.
All these challenges of other martial 

508
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:04,694
arts and to prove that Jujitsu was the 
best and not be ready to receive the 

509
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,124
thousands of people that now want to 
learn what they just proved to be 

510
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:13,994
effective.

511
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,253
How was it to grow up as young men 
transitioning from childhood through 

512
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:20,744
adolescence and puberty with the natural
imperatives to impress your masculinity 

513
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:29,390
and individuality on your family 
environment when what goes before you?

514
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:32,390
Is there sort of a warrior class?
How,

515
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,680
what was it like being teenage boys?
What do you see?

516
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,410
Every day?
I proved my warrior spirit on him.

517
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,750
She,
I'll tell you also,

518
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,693
I prove to my family and everybody,
all my uncles and cousins and my 

519
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,270
grandfather,
then I was a warrior by how much I could

520
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,770
beat him up.
So as a young kid,

521
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,780
he did receive a little bit,
I'm sorry,

522
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,800
but that was me trying to prove that I 
was warrior and now it was the big thing

523
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:58,290
because there's a little pressure,
especially at the age of 13,

524
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,510
14 of wanting to be,
you know,

525
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:01,710
what they were,
which,

526
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:02,790
which is,
you know,

527
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,010
these,
like you said,

528
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,310
it's warriors.
But,

529
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:06,061
um,
as you know,

530
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:06,894
as time passes,
we quickly realized that what they are 

531
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,180
is,
it's not just warriors,

532
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,060
they're more than warriors.
They're here to help people in,

533
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:15,894
to save the world.
So I didn't necessarily see my uncles 

534
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:19,644
and my father as these fighters.
I saw them as men that were making a 

535
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,870
difference in changing lives.

536
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,710
Hmm.
So that aspect of it,

537
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,800
the sort of a social and compassionate 
aspect was you were aware of that?

538
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,630
Yeah,
quite young.

539
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,750
I think that might've been even a little
stronger,

540
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,613
especially exciting.
Go down the route of fighting 

541
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,040
professional,
being an athlete in a fighter.

542
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:40,874
I went down the route of a teacher,
so maybe I was more influenced by the 

543
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,640
teachers that were in the world in my 
life.

544
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,873
Hmm.
Although sort of the generation before 

545
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:50,770
you,
there are,

546
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,340
you know,
world renowned fires.

547
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,111
Yes.
Well,

548
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:55,944
and they were also around teaching,
but they were in a time where nobody 

549
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:00,120
believed that Jujitsu was

550
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,440
best martial art in the world.
When hoists Gracie wins UFC one,

551
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,600
like in the interview straight 
afterwards,

552
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,010
what are you gonna do?
He says,

553
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:11,220
I don't care about the money that they 
owe $50,000.

554
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,360
He says,
I watch it every day.

555
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,820
I don't care about the money.
I'm going back to teaching.

556
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,090
That's what you'd like the end of last 
week.

557
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,770
That's what he says.
Uh,

558
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,613
so like it's clear that whilst there is 
the imperative to prove for presumably 

559
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:29,220
for honor and for mission,
the efficiency of this martial art,

560
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,050
there is a sort of a dedication and a 
devotion that's not just about glory,

561
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,410
glamour,
superficial thing.

562
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,553
I mean if you fight,
that's a face you can fight for three 

563
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,680
years,
nine years,

564
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,514
12 years,
but you can teach Jujitsu forever and 

565
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,480
there's nothing more rewarding than 
giving people this,

566
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,690
this magic Jujitsu is magic.
It takes,

567
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,850
took Ellie Gracie from,
you know,

568
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,760
small hundred and you know,
30 pound frail man could,

569
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,420
couldn't do anything to the superhero of
the world.

570
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,970
So this is magic.
We're distributing magic.

571
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,010
Whoever wants it,
we're here to give it.

572
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,050
And there are schools all around the 
world doing the same thing.

573
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:08,370
So doing that,
like there's no problem waking up,

574
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:09,900
coming to work.
We're not going to work.

575
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,220
We're just going to show up and give 
magic.

576
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:14,790
You see how it is when you walk in here?
I think that part of the reason why this

577
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,440
concept of wow,
you guys are,

578
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,900
there's just such a humility towards 
you're here to serve.

579
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,440
You're here to teach this and not to 
bask in the glory of winning UFC.

580
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,080
One white voice wasn't very ostentatious
or like you know,

581
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,640
you know too crazy about it.
And I think the reason why it's hard for

582
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:30,474
the,
the general population to understand 

583
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,484
this is because the only other time they
ever see fights or any type of major 

584
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:36,684
competition happen,
it's between two athletes have the same 

585
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,923
skillset.
You see a boxer against a boxer to 

586
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:44,550
boxers fight each other with the same 
beliefs in boxing.

587
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,520
One guy wins.
So who won that match?

588
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:50,220
It wasn't a box,
it wasn't boxing that won that match.

589
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,083
It was a boxer,
a person who won the match between two 

590
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:55,344
boxers.
What you have to understand what the 

591
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,684
hoist and even our grandfather in the 
few challenge matches that we had of 

592
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:02,790
guys who didn't believe in Jujitsu is we
aren't fighting.

593
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,620
Jujitsu is fighting.
Jujitsu won UFC.

594
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:08,454
One hoists did not.
When UFC one Jujitsu won UFC one and it 

595
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:15,534
beat karate and it beats a vod and it'd 
beat boxing and it beat these other 

596
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,681
martial arts,
right?

597
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,370
It was more effective than all those 
other.

598
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,204
So they get,
that's very important understanding 

599
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:23,450
because you can pull it

600
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,360
and it's also,
it's very significant to keep banging on

601
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:29,060
about it.
This is significant religious idea.

602
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,953
Most religions are built on the idea 
that your individual identity is not as 

603
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:39,080
important as the ideology that is 
managing your consciousness.

604
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,190
That if you slide and also surrender the
idea that you surrender,

605
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:44,960
that you are only a vessel

606
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,550
for our grandfather is the 100% believed
that it wasn't him who won any fights.

607
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:52,504
It was Jujitsu hoist.
When you see it after UFC one 

608
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:56,800
perpetuates this same conviction that 
listen you guys,

609
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,530
I'm,
I'm,

610
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,540
I'm,
I'm here,

611
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,433
but Jujitsu is what is special and I 
have other brothers who can do just as 

612
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,150
well as I can.
I'm not the only one.

613
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,350
I'm just a representative.
Oh.

614
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:06,184
He very outspoken about the fact that 
other brothers could have done what he 

615
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:09,304
did and he was chosen because him and my
dad had a good relationship and hoist 

616
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,930
was one of the smaller members of the 
family.

617
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,913
So it was actually a more impressive 
demonstration of Jujitsu is 

618
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:20,080
effectiveness for someone smaller to be 
that vessel.

619
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,330
But absolutely.
Um,

620
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,470
Jujitsu.
Is it religion?

621
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,420
Hmm.
Well,

622
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,200
what that does,
it tells the whole world,

623
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,843
anybody can do it.
Anybody can jump on board and join this 

624
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,730
religion of Jujitsu.
Okay.

625
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,893
I'll ask a little more because there's a
very interesting moment in that first 

626
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,130
ufc where your father,
I believe,

627
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:42,131
presents your grandfather with a sort of
a trophy to honor intense.

628
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,090
Your grandfather heard that the energy 
is very still intense.

629
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,963
I mean,
even this image of him here that people 

630
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,643
watching visually,
we'll see this is something he was 

631
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:55,750
emanate in some thing.
He got a kind of monk energy know,

632
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,480
like what was he like as a human being?
This is like,

633
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,770
he's not,
he's intense.

634
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,450
Right?
You suppose some humility,

635
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,370
I listened to him when he was talking 
this humility,

636
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,473
but this is a person that is very,
I know some people that are swamis 

637
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,710
priests,
etc.

638
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,830
There's a very sort of a peculiar energy
at the peculiar emanation.

639
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:15,250
Yes.

640
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,020
He was,
I don't know.

641
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:21,970
I think present and unfazed.
I think to him,

642
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,060
very few things actually mattered to 
him.

643
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,950
Do you know what I'm saying?
So the point is,

644
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,760
ah,
no,

645
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,320
he didn't hear that.
He's right here.

646
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,090
If you're talking to him,
he's talking to you.

647
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,190
If he's teaching you,
you're the world to him.

648
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,050
Oh Wow.
And if you're,

649
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,850
if you do right by him,
he'll do right by you,

650
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,610
the most loyal guy you'll ever meet.
And if not,

651
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:40,330
he'll just,
you know,

652
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,820
if you guys aren't together,
we're not together.

653
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,920
He's very all or nothing with him.
It was very real with him.

654
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,560
There was never any in between.
And um,

655
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,423
you know,
the absolute and that moment you're 

656
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,790
talking about when he received the 
award,

657
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,050
he was very,
you know,

658
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,023
whether he was,
it was still in between Hawaii's 

659
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,890
fighting.
True.

660
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,900
So he's still in,
he's fighting that night.

661
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,793
That's true.
Jujitsu is fighting his family's fine 

662
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,940
Jujitsu twice.
So he's still ain't fight mode.

663
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,313
Right.
Because remember he did this his whole 

664
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:09,821
life.
He says,

665
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,440
bring in so many arenas.
So He's,

666
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,423
he can't quite be smiling yet.
He's still at least there's no 

667
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:14,860
celebration yet.
Yeah.

668
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,940
How come that this award was given in 
that context?

669
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:19,774
You know,
cause this ufc one that's there in lies 

670
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,224
the product of when the person who 
created the UFC basically can do 

671
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,430
whatever you want.
Right?

672
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:29,264
So this is your father and my father is 
giving an award to his soul is a little 

673
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:32,290
bit,
um,

674
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,340
how do you say it?
A little bit.

675
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,640
Um,
you know,

676
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:35,951
you know,
he,

677
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:36,784
my dad was holding all the cards.
So He created the show and he wanted to 

678
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:42,520
honor someone and he believed that that 
is the original ultimate fighter.

679
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,680
And without him there would be no UFC.

680
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,573
So as the creator,
you're allowed to do whatever you want 

681
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,670
of the UFC.
You're allowed to do whatever you want.

682
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,140
And to honor the guy who gave birth to 
you,

683
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,990
who gave birth to the ability to even 
create this type of entity through which

684
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:54,970
to communicate martial arts,
you can do whatever you want.

685
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:58,780
He did what made sense.
And it makes only makes perfect sense to

686
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:01,860
have this guy in the octagon at ufc one 
receiving,

687
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,280
especially to everyone who knew that 
we're now,

688
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,230
there are some people who booed the 
occurrence.

689
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,230
I know because you just want to see more
fight.

690
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,740
You want to see more people wondering 
who is this guy?

691
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,210
Why is he getting an award right now?
We don't care.

692
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:13,240
We want to see more punches and mortar 
beer and let's just get crazy right now.

693
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,193
So there was that audience.
But anybody who knew the origin of 

694
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,910
Jujitsu,
that UFC gracie family there,

695
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:22,210
this is absolutely,
if you're enjoying the UFC,

696
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,070
okay,
thank him today.

697
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,240
Even today.
Thank him.

698
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,200
And thank our father hardy on Gracie and
thank every Gracie who's ever fun,

699
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,800
put their neck on the line against other
arts to get it to the point where it can

700
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,450
be this spectacle on television.
Yeah.

701
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,840
How do you feel about how the UFC has 
permutate it?

702
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,930
He seems to me like at the FCA is it 
become a huge spectacle and a,

703
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,420
it's usually successful and must be 
generating a lot of revenue.

704
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,460
But from a person that's doesn't know 
very much about it,

705
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:52,820
it seems that why he's had to do in 
order to do that is to let go of many of

706
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,370
their principles of its foundation,
uh,

707
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,204
to align itself as many sports have done
with the principles of consumer 

708
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,270
capitalism in order that it can be more 
spectacular,

709
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,490
etc.
So how is that?

710
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,533
Well,
everything you just said is what we 

711
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:09,740
feel.
We feel that Jujitsu or the UFC began as

712
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:14,570
something that was exclusively designed,
make no mistake about it as a vehicle to

713
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:15,404
demonstrate the effectiveness and 
superiority of some arts and the 

714
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,540
insufficiencies of up and deficiencies 
of other arts.

715
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,670
That's the only reason he was even 
conceived.

716
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,300
It was just to show the difference of 
different martial arts and it served its

717
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,220
purpose after UFC four,
five,

718
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,390
six,
right in that pocket,

719
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,351
everyone said,
wow,

720
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:35,630
that little Brazilian guy wrapped up in 
the white pajamas,

721
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,190
he's going to win.
You know what I'm saying?

722
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:38,750
Like that guy in a tie,
you watch,

723
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,584
he's this little skinny guys going.
And once you started becoming where you 

724
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,314
knew the outcome before it happened,
Jujitsu had made it to America and to 

725
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,064
the world and mission accomplished,
we'll call it from an education 

726
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,034
perspective,
and then since then things started 

727
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:51,770
changing on the production side.

728
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,603
They started adding time limits and 
rules and weight classes and they 

729
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:58,460
modified the format so much so to make 
it more friendly for television and then

730
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:01,760
eventually thanks to Dana White and the 
fertitta brothers,

731
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,560
they made it a sanctioned sport where 
people collapse.

732
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,630
It's actually a,
it'd be four.

733
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:08,360
It was just a fight on TV and then it 
became a sanctioned sport,

734
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,403
which even though that was very much 
against the origins of what we were 

735
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,010
trying to do with the UFC,
and by we,

736
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,840
I mean our father and our ancestors 
there,

737
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,123
even though it was against that,
it was absolutely necessary for it to 

738
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:20,054
stick around because it was running into
some political pressure that it was 

739
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:22,844
going to get pretty much terminated 
entirely if it didn't make the 

740
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,890
adaptations necessary to grow to what it
has today.

741
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,813
And we benefit immensely from its 
current popularity today because 

742
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,150
Jujitsu's main exposure to the world is 
in the,

743
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:35,660
in the,
uh,

744
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,170
through the means of UFC fight where one
guy does a choke hold that you know,

745
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,550
ruined if a chocolate or a triangle 
choke,

746
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:43,310
which is now a household name because of
the UFC.

747
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,780
And because of the,
you know,

748
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,370
millions,
billions of viewers worldwide.

749
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,223
We,
we can say that the UFC today doesn't 

750
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:53,741
allow Jujitsu the way as you gracie 
practice use two to be demonstrated.

751
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,930
It's tougher because of the fact that 
you have rounds.

752
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:57,764
He doesn't allow you to let your 
opponent exhaust and burn energy while 

753
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:03,980
you're conserving energy forces a little
more of you to push the pace.

754
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,083
So it's not quite the safest Jujitsu,
but yet there are still many amazing 

755
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:12,300
examples of Jujitsu and being done at 
principals being performed.

756
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,540
I remember the boxing example how when 
two boxers fight,

757
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,493
boxing doesn't win.
A person wins today in the UFC when two 

758
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,290
guys fight.
It's not like,

759
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,273
you know,
when we have fighters here who will 

760
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,640
represent and fight in the UFC,
who are students of ours,

761
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,010
who we have one is fighting right now in
a few weeks.

762
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,160
Um,
and,

763
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,870
and UFC two 22 and he goes into,
he represents Jujitsu,

764
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,713
he does Jujitsu,
but his opponent is a black belt in 

765
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,470
Jujitsu also.
So when he goes in there,

766
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,600
it's not so much Jujitsu one because 
they both believe in Jujitsu.

767
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,060
So our students' application of Jujitsu 
and his intelligence,

768
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,933
his approach to the fight,
maybe more intelligent and he may 

769
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:47,724
prevail or not.
So it's an individual who's going to 

770
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,480
win,
not an art anymore.

771
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,343
And that's what the,
basically what he was talking about is 

772
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,414
now you have competitive athletes have 
high athleticism and capabilities going 

773
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:01,530
in their testing their individual 
attributes more so than the authenticity

774
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,423
or legitimacy of the art they practice.
Cause everyone's packed in the same 

775
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:05,470
stuff.
So,

776
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,280
so that argument has been won this 
demonstrating.

777
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,070
So what I telling you,
this is what I know and other aspects of

778
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:11,904
this conversation I'm interested to 
explore is you as men living in the 

779
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,890
ordinary world,
what is,

780
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:17,724
uh,
what's it like for you if you find 

781
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:23,740
yourself in a situation or physical 
conflict or if a physical fret,

782
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,753
a emerges,
what is that like and tell us some 

783
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,920
stories.
Bad x people love shit like that.

784
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,963
You know,
people say that getting in a fight is 

785
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:38,860
easy and walking away it's difficult,
which I guess I kind of like that.

786
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,810
It's a little,
it was a good little light that line.

787
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,170
But getting in a fight is also easy,
especially if you're scared,

788
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,890
you don't know what to do.
Just go crazy and just attack the person

789
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,990
out of fear.
But for us,

790
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,000
we're like,
I feel like I walk around this world and

791
00:36:55,001 --> 00:37:00,001
I look at 99% of the people in the world
as sheep.

792
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,980
How do,
what do you mean by that?

793
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,050
Like in terms of physical threat,
threat to me,

794
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,840
like they're all sheep.
So if I,

795
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,713
if somebody happens to be cussing at me 
in a car honking at me and flipping me 

796
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:18,100
off or in line at a restaurant,
there's this respect done.

797
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,660
I look at that and I say,
man,

798
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,940
there's,
there's zero of that.

799
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,700
I don't need to get my heart doesn't 
even race anymore.

800
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,290
What about a Disney world melon example?
I was at Disneyland.

801
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,270
I had a melon in my hand and as I walked
into the hotel,

802
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,100
this man called me.
He said,

803
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:38,530
look at that guy carrying as melon.
I was with my girlfriend,

804
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:39,610
my wife now,
and he's,

805
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,820
he said he must be a faggot.
And then I had the melon,

806
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,860
I said,
is he talking to me?

807
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,870
I says,
must be the only guy with a melon.

808
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,610
Everyone's got an unusual,
it's an unusual accessory.

809
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,770
I looked and I thought,
man,

810
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,530
this guy,
why would he say that?

811
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,603
You know?
And I looked at the guy and he has two 

812
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,250
kids with him,
a seven and a nine year old.

813
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,190
And I just smiled and I said,
wow,

814
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,960
I have a good day.
And that's it.

815
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,873
But there was no,
I didn't feel like you know what he's 

816
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,940
like and I was with my girlfriend.

817
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,043
Especially being with a woman you can 
feel like you want to defend your honor 

818
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,760
in front of her end up in Charlotte.
Tough you are,

819
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,763
but the fact that he was five,
seven maybe the little easier to walk 

820
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:24,070
away.
Maybe if he was six,

821
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,890
five and really big and a potential 
threat.

822
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,753
I might've worn it to prove a little 
more but then again I don't even think 

823
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:30,730
so.
I would have still look and said,

824
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:33,190
sir,
is everything okay just to be clear.

825
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,450
I want to,
if he wants,

826
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,284
if he really to fight,
we kind of have to give them the option 

827
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,883
for you,
your confidence in this martial art as 

828
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:45,460
moved you to a place where the 
circumference of fear in much fervor,

829
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,303
way it would for you violence or 
confrontation or combat is something 

830
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,060
that would only occur when absolutely 
necessary.

831
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,910
Probably much more likely to happen to 
me because I was like like in the vote,

832
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,310
like if something like that happens for 
me,

833
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,300
panic,
fear,

834
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,800
chaos,
demonstration.

835
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,633
People don't realize how they,
how much they contribute to making a 

836
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:05,650
street fight happen.
That's interesting.

837
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,900
Right when you,
it was an argument between two people at

838
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:09,490
the top.
If we know what we're yelling,

839
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,310
then there's pushing other punching in 
their Friday.

840
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:14,140
So we have,
so we're contributing.

841
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,033
We can either make it a fight or we can 
make it a conversation that ends right 

842
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:19,504
there.
So knowing how to respond to somebody 

843
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,413
that's pissed off,
he took their parking spot or who's who 

844
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:26,980
you ask them to look at their girlfriend
in an inappropriate way,

845
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:30,880
knowing how to speak to that person.
It means everything and how you speak to

846
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:31,714
them stems from how you feel and if you 
feel like everything's okay and that 

847
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,710
you're not going to be hurt and that if 
you do get in a fight,

848
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:39,544
it will all be fine.
Then you're going to speak to a much 

849
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:41,290
more code.

850
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,370
If you don't feel safe.
If you don't feel prepared to handle the

851
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:50,320
physical altercation that might happen.
You're going to respond in fear and that

852
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,710
fear is going to escalate.
The combative energy between us,

853
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:56,130
the way you have to look at it is you 
have to imagine that between,

854
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:56,964
and you don't deny there is a meter and 
everything he says either increases the 

855
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:04,480
combative energy or decreases it.
Everything.

856
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:05,314
There is no neutral increased or 
decreased and everything I say is going 

857
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:08,944
to increase or decrease.
But here's what's interesting is that I 

858
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:14,650
can only reach the threshold that it 
needs to reach for the fight to actually

859
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,720
happen.
You have to reach a certain threshold,

860
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,673
right?
It's not going to happen from a calm 

861
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,760
composed civil conversation unless 
someone's out to assault you and rob you

862
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,594
with their own intention.
But in terms of the street fights that 

863
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,600
we typically think of,
which is someone looks at,

864
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:26,434
someone goes like that and now I'll 
fight is on like that situation to 

865
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:29,110
happen.

866
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,943
It has to reach a certain energy and 
when he don't says when I come up and I 

867
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,070
bumped in or I say,
why did you do this?

868
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:33,904
Or why'd you look at her?
What the elder and I get excited and he 

869
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:36,484
responds with equal excitement and fear 
and any energy that creates that 

870
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,710
escalation.
And then once it hits the threshold,

871
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,080
someone's going to push someone and then
someone's going to swing in.

872
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:45,730
The fight is on,
you know what we're saying is,

873
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,773
but knowing how to fight makes it to 
where you can respond to that initial 

874
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:52,180
stimulus so calmly that they go,
man,

875
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,014
what's this guy guys?
These guys freaking guy partially 

876
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,520
believe something.
I kind of believe there's,

877
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,560
there's nothing someone can do to make 
me fight them other than attack me right

878
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:03,304
now.
Even if they had their hand on my 

879
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,361
shoulder,
like,

880
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,350
yeah,
you don't know man.

881
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,170
Even then they're not attacking you.
They're still talking to me.

882
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,260
I don't take that as an attack or as 
most people,

883
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,630
he put his hand on me.
But when it becomes a fight,

884
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:14,464
so there's,
there's very few things you can do to 

885
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,970
make it a fight.
And what is one throat punch?

886
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,310
It's it to go over a headlock.
That's it.

887
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:25,150
Anything other than punching me or 
trying to grab my whole body,

888
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,630
there's no fight going down.
It makes me realize that in my own life,

889
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,120
not even outside of the idea of physical
combat,

890
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,013
in the idea of just emotional,
where there will be no physical 

891
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,684
conflict,
romantic relationships even or the 

892
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,680
equivalent of putting the hand on my 
shoulder.

893
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,330
I'm too easily triggered as a person.
I'm too busy looking for problem,

894
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,021
problem,
fear,

895
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,570
fear like it's too much in my makeup,
you know,

896
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,920
like it's too much in my makeup.

897
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,120
Um,
but uh,

898
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,900
more,
uh,

899
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,660
local example before we drop deeper 
again,

900
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,910
uh,
what about what you told me the house of

901
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:58,330
Blues Story.
So little stories.

902
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,560
My now wife then girlfriend were at the 
house of Blues over there in Anaheim.

903
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,690
We were watching our friends also might 
be amazing.

904
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,873
Uh,
Latin dog crew and they're doing their 

905
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:12,830
music thing and I'm in there and it's 
great music and uh,

906
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:13,664
I'm standing with even,
it's a semi crowded situation and 

907
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,154
there's a guy to my immediate right here
who basically created his own marsh pit 

908
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,770
by himself,
by himself.

909
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,870
He's mushing alone cause just poor and 
poor going gold.

910
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,420
And then bought me once and I'm like,
all right,

911
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,880
I'm a passive patient,
gentle guy.

912
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,950
And he bumps me again and I'm like,
he's having a good time.

913
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,580
But it got to the point where you know 
you wanted to match with him,

914
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,020
you want a match.

915
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,853
We got to the point where he was making 
it unpleasant because I was not able to 

916
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:40,640
focus on the,
the,

917
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,474
the,
the party.

918
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,250
And then I thought,
well we could just move.

919
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,820
But then the problem is I would permit 
him to continue his behavior,

920
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,130
which would make it unpleasant for other
people around round him.

921
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,360
So the conclusion was made that he had 
to be dealt with.

922
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,830
And I thought,
okay,

923
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:57,680
you know how to,
it's very noisy and I couldn't just say,

924
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:58,514
excuse me sir.
Excuse me.

925
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,620
It would be two out of the Er.
I had to get his attention.

926
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,340
So this might be the first time there's 
a necessary physical demonstration.

927
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,470
Is it,
is it possible?

928
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,610
Can you cover this?
Cause you,

929
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,270
I can say it right here.
It's pretty fascinating.

930
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,250
Yeah,
I'll do it.

931
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:10,801
To Russell the,
yeah,

932
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:12,450
so he's here,
my machine.

933
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,383
I said,
hey man can tell you having a very good 

934
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:17,444
time,
but I'm not right here with you bumping 

935
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:19,724
into me every second.
So why don't we call him down and let's 

936
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:21,914
continue to watch the music said.
What are the significant aspects of 

937
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:25,191
that?
Well,

938
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:27,380
first of all,
I just had to,

939
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:28,214
and I didn't yell at him.
I whispered to him like it was like 

940
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:30,770
that.
Even though it was noisy,

941
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,960
like I was so close that I didn't have 
to go.

942
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,180
So as you can see what I entered right 
here,

943
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:38,000
it's one hand on the neck.
I don't like that feel.

944
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm the head of the tricep right here.
One hand the triceps.

945
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,160
So right now I'll put me in the face 
right here.

946
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,930
Can't I'm too close.
Turn in country.

947
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,220
The other hand,
I've got you right here.

948
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:46,040
We're in the clean shot.
Ready?

949
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,390
We got them.
Okay,

950
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,120
so we're already a have a tactical 
position right here.

951
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:52,490
I've safety.
But this right here sends a message.

952
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:53,990
What does it says?
Control.

953
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,600
It's like,
I think we've animals.

954
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:59,120
Like when you put a puppy in your mouth.
I know I don't put puppies in my mouth.

955
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,073
When your mum was a puppy in its mouth,
I think that sending a very old message 

956
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,713
deep into the biology,
this brought him back to when he was 

957
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,660
like for his dad would grab him.
I'm like,

958
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,460
don't call on the wall [inaudible] know 
about your past,

959
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:17,870
but all we know is this.
Listen the guy absolutely still,

960
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,123
and he didn't even look at me.
That's what's crazy is that he wasn't 

961
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:23,320
even in a position to look at me like 
my,

962
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,163
this thumb right here has a little bit 
of a pressure point of pass a field 

963
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,620
that,
and I just whispered this right here and

964
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,780
he knew what he was doing cause he knew 
he bumped into me already.

965
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,980
So after I let go,
I said,

966
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,430
are we cool?
Yeah.

967
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,753
Sounded like that was it.
And I didn't move and he didn't match 

968
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,040
anymore.
The the,

969
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,400
the mosh pit was done and here's the 
deal.

970
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,323
He didn't know who I was.
He didn't know what I could have fought 

971
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,221
me.
I mean,

972
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:48,240
I did assert myself a little bit there,
but that was a situation where calm,

973
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,100
assertive,
calm,

974
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:50,934
assertive,
accomplish many things because when you 

975
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,640
can remain calm and put your hands on 
somebody,

976
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:57,570
if you have two,
or even in communication,

977
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:00,210
let's say it was a totally not noisy 
situation,

978
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,620
and I said,
listen man,

979
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,720
you're a behavior is getting a little 
out of control.

980
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,543
I don't appreciate it and I'm going to 
have to have you calm down a little bit 

981
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,800
and I can talk to him like that and I 
can be calm and composed and direct with

982
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,540
someone.
People appreciate that and they go,

983
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,560
man,
either he has a gun or he used the black

984
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,394
vote at something or he knows something 
and that you know that the ability to 

985
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:19,030
compose yourself that way comes from 
Jujitsu cause,

986
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,380
sorry,
the terror

987
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,180
trey off putting your hand on someone's 
neck and doing that.

988
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,900
I think that's already Jujitsu master 
territory.

989
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,270
I think for me,
I think if I would be,

990
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,730
if I was going to confront someone in 
that kind of way,

991
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,743
I think that would be a little too,
I think that'd be a little too 

992
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:36,880
aggressive to do that.
So like you know,

993
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:37,970
like because it's,
for me,

994
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:40,190
I think I wouldn't be feeling very calm.
Basically.

995
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:41,840
It's good to know that the things that 
you did was,

996
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:44,060
you spoke quietly,
you did something that was controlling.

997
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,640
I think for most people that are 
novices,

998
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,510
the kind of situation is going to happen
is when someone direct

999
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,183
c'mon front,
she would just have an attitude with 

1000
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:52,711
you.
Yeah,

1001
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:55,350
and you know what we say is this,
you know,

1002
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,610
Egos and alcohol,
99.9%

1003
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,444
of fights,
altercations that happened today would 

1004
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:03,744
be completely nonexistent if you remove 
the egos and the alcohol from the 

1005
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:09,000
equation.
Right?

1006
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,690
Oh,
I've taken the alcohol out,

1007
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:13,750
but in the ego's bad,
I know you said that on the front door,

1008
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:15,040
the door mat here,
he says,

1009
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,860
leave your ego here.
Why do you think that?

1010
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,540
What do you mean by that?

1011
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,160
You're,
you're,

1012
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,993
you're the funeral.
They had to prove to everybody that 

1013
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,190
you're the best.
Everybody.

1014
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,160
Isn't this the proving ground in many 
ways they want to,

1015
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,200
everybody wants to be the best on the 
mat.

1016
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,540
So don't worry about being the best you 
can.

1017
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:34,630
Try to execute proper technique and 
defeat each other.

1018
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,250
But this idea of,
you know,

1019
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,920
you're greater than everybody else.
You know what's funny about that,

1020
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,120
Matt though,
is that it says,

1021
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,070
leave your ego at the door as if you 
have a choice.

1022
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,020
You know,
it's crazy as shit.

1023
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,933
It should say,
pick your ego up right here when you 

1024
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:47,740
leave.
That's what it should say.

1025
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,080
Huh?
Because it's just not coming in with you

1026
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,090
because whoever comes in with the ego,
guess what happens?

1027
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,960
It gets taken out.
And when it gets taken out of you,

1028
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,640
if you can let your ego,
well,

1029
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:58,031
yeah,
I mean,

1030
00:46:58,031 --> 00:47:00,130
my point is even when you come in for 
your first class,

1031
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,881
we said,
Hey Russell,

1032
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:02,080
how would you escape this position?

1033
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,700
And you go,
ah,

1034
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,290
I can't,
and then we say,

1035
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,124
well,
try this and you go about it as much 

1036
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,534
better.
So you had to let go of the fact that 

1037
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:10,330
you had the answer.
In order to learn the new answer,

1038
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:12,070
you have to empty the cup to fill it 
back up again.

1039
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,173
So when someone comes in,
if they get into the class and they 

1040
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:16,414
don't want to accept the fact that they 
don't have the answer for a particular 

1041
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:20,890
threat scenario,
they can't learn the new answer and they

1042
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,750
typically will leave before they ever 
do.

1043
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,230
So the students who stick around,
all of them have to detach themselves to

1044
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:27,064
some degree from there.
A preexisting egos otherwise won't even 

1045
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,530
make it in the building.
And one small thing and speaking night,

1046
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,350
egos and alcohol.
This idea when somebody confronts you in

1047
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,430
the street,
right?

1048
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:41,140
Just very natural nail and the words are
exchange and looks when you know,

1049
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:41,974
if you want to avoid a fight in a heated
moment like that where there's words 

1050
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,124
being exchange,
think about what you have to do in that 

1051
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:47,110
moment.

1052
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,110
And it's your ego.
You have to be okay saying to whoever it

1053
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:54,730
is that you're arguing with.
I apologize.

1054
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,590
I crossed the line.
I made a mistake.

1055
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,700
I see.
Why you're angry at somebody.

1056
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,190
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not,

1057
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,820
I don't know what I was thinking.
How can you want to fight me when I say,

1058
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:04,654
hey,
you're right.

1059
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,250
I don't know where I was thinking,
you're right.

1060
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,960
I crossed the line.
I'm going to move back.

1061
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:09,790
I'm not going to do that again.
Start Defense.

1062
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,580
If we instead feel like it may be I was 
right,

1063
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,473
I can say no,
you shouldn't have said that and I was 

1064
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:16,750
here first.
That kind of attitude.

1065
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,890
There's no,
there's no point.

1066
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:18,724
It's going to lead to a fight.
We're willing to do whatever it takes 

1067
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:25,930
not to fight and there's good reasons 
why you guys listen via avoidance of the

1068
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:26,764
fight is the most,
especially for our viewers and 

1069
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,700
listeners,
the avoidance of a street fight,

1070
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,580
even one that might seem absolutely 
eminent,

1071
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,473
it's unavoidable is the most important 
selfdefence tip you'll ever learn in 

1072
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,640
your life.

1073
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,473
I've never been in a street fight.
I was wondering when I was in seventh 

1074
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:44,530
grade and that was the last one.
I was 1213 years old.

1075
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,000
That's the last fight I've ever been in 
my size.

1076
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,280
A little bit of a diffusing situations.
But the point is this,

1077
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,400
the street fight,
even the street fight that you win,

1078
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,830
you often lose.
Because think about this,

1079
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,570
you get into a fight,
you fall down,

1080
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,760
you know you take someone down,
your elbow hits the ground,

1081
00:48:58,761 --> 00:48:59,594
you get stitches,
you gotta go to the hospital after you 

1082
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:02,620
get an infection,
staph infection and you won the fight.

1083
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:03,454
Let's you say you won.
Or let's say for our friends who don't 

1084
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,920
know Jujitsu,
you get into a street fight,

1085
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:08,000
someone pops up,
you puff up,

1086
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:08,834
they puff up your profile,
you swing and you crack them and you 

1087
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:12,920
chipped her tooth.
And now you have a $20,000

1088
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:14,600
dental bill on your hands.

1089
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,340
Because we live in a litigious society.
So self defense doesn't just mean how to

1090
00:49:19,341 --> 00:49:22,790
avoid getting knocked out.
Defense means self preservation,

1091
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,240
preservation of your finances so you 
don't get sued.

1092
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,253
Preservation of your body.
If you get in this fight and you get 

1093
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:29,943
beneath someone and you're in the bottom
of the guard and let's say they have a 

1094
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:35,480
bloody nose cause you hit him on the way
in and now they're bleeding on you.

1095
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,373
There is,
you know there is blood borne diseases 

1096
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:38,924
are transferred sexually transmitted 
diseases and the blood born illnesses 

1097
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,223
that can be transferred.
So you don't want someone bleeding on 

1098
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,114
you in a fight.
You want to avoid anything that has to 

1099
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:48,860
do with the fight.
So this idea of don't fight because it's

1100
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:49,694
the right thing you did know.
Don't fight because it's a stupid thing 

1101
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,340
to fight if you can avoid it.

1102
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,670
Any costs you want to avoid a fight.
And I feel like too many people thinking

1103
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:58,504
about self defense,
that's just the ability to win the 

1104
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,420
fight,
not the ability to avoid it altogether.

1105
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,850
Very difficult to overcome that because 
we live in quite a Marshall Society.

1106
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:05,684
We live in a city.
Like if you take the example of what's 

1107
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:07,664
happening in UFC,
something that started as a 

1108
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:10,604
demonstration of the efficacy of a 
particular Marsha are in universal or 

1109
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:15,074
open conditions became controlled.
And regulated for the purposes of 

1110
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,890
commercial purposes,
it seems to me it as well.

1111
00:50:21,891 --> 00:50:22,724
Another thing that I'm learning for us 
from my early experiences of Brazilian 

1112
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:27,760
Jujitsu,
it's about very much awareness.

1113
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,250
It's

1114
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,740
about having an awareness of your life 
as a whole.

1115
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,250
Like,
you know,

1116
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,790
I don't want to get into confrontations 
and an awareness of the prison.

1117
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,340
While I'm listening to the two of you 
talk,

1118
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,850
I'm continually thinking these are 
universal principles.

1119
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:45,320
These are applicable outside of the art 
of Jujitsu,

1120
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,380
an outside of combat that when I'm 
approaching my work,

1121
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:51,500
when I'm approaching my relationships,
stay in the moment,

1122
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,600
think I'm with this woman for the rest 
of my life.

1123
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:54,434
So why do I want to have a big argument 
where I say something damaging or with 

1124
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:58,574
my child,
I have a relationship with last river 

1125
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,730
through.
It's not in a sense,

1126
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:05,510
it's like the combat and conflict 
because it is so vivid.

1127
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,553
It's more of the,
it makes certain principals more 

1128
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,800
obvious,
also applicable in all communication.

1129
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,740
Because I suppose as we've said earlier,
this is a language.

1130
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,020
This is a,
uh,

1131
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,560
a,
a form of communication.

1132
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:19,394
And one of the things I've noticed with 
both of you and even that demonstration 

1133
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,083
is that's a communications expert.
That's someone who knows how to 

1134
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,090
communicate in a very,
very expert way.

1135
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,043
And possibly the reason you've not had 
any street fights is because for the 

1136
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,910
last 20 years you've been neck cramping 
people.

1137
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,790
Well,
every time I leave my house,

1138
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,030
I only did that one time.
But I will say this,

1139
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,920
we go to the principal's,
you're referencing a,

1140
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,803
it's beautiful because you know we talk 
about self defense and fight and not 

1141
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,413
fight and egos and alcohol.
But what's crazy is that for every one 

1142
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,720
time that I've ever had the touch 
someone,

1143
00:51:51,721 --> 00:51:54,360
there's that blue's house of blues and 
there was the one in seventh grade.

1144
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,093
I have applied shit,
absolute core Jujitsu principles on the 

1145
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:01,824
business front,
on the personal front a thousand times 

1146
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:05,964
to one.
What's an example of the welcome to the 

1147
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:09,151
party,
Bro?

1148
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:11,930
Let's talk.
How many do we have time for?

1149
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,490
So this is what's so beautiful and 
here's what's crazy Russell,

1150
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,620
is that we,
this is true for our lives.

1151
00:52:16,621 --> 00:52:17,454
100% Jujitsu is life.
Life is your Jitsu because these 

1152
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:20,274
principles are universal that we're 
going to demonstrate or combat 

1153
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:22,674
principles.

1154
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,540
There are 17 noncombat principles that 
apply to,

1155
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,603
uh,
to everyday life into business and 

1156
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,020
relationships and we'll talk about a few
whatever we have time for it.

1157
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,363
But here's what's crazy is that our 
students who train with us start for 

1158
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:36,804
self defense,
but they stick for the life application 

1159
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,664
of everything.
We're learning here that once you've 

1160
00:52:42,781 --> 00:52:44,190
trained for six months,
including you,

1161
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:44,911
five,
six,

1162
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:45,744
seven months of good Jujitsu,
you'll never need to train again for 

1163
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:49,170
self defense reasons,
you'll be okay.

1164
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,183
You'll know how to manage distance.
You know how to avoid getting knocked 

1165
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:52,374
out.
You at least won't go to the hospital 

1166
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:54,630
and you're good to go.
That's all you need for a fight.

1167
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:57,030
Just don't get beat up.
You'll have that ability in a few months

1168
00:52:57,031 --> 00:53:00,780
with Jujitsu,
but then why keep training for 16 years?

1169
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,390
Because every single day you come to 
class,

1170
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,960
you're reinforcing principles that we're
going to demonstrate right now.

1171
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,730
All right,
we got on the floor and now we're here.

1172
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:11,970
Come on.
Just going to be safe.

1173
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,240
I'll call commentary because our friends
at home who are listening to this,

1174
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,163
we're going to do the best we can,
but let's just demonstrate one here 

1175
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,310
called position before submission.
Critical principle,

1176
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,130
the right move at the wrong time is the 
wrong move.

1177
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:25,800
He don't as right now mounted on me.
It's called the mountains you do to both

1178
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:26,634
knees over my body.
And what amazing submission from right 

1179
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:29,274
here is he pins the arm down.
He locks his elbow and he goes under my 

1180
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:33,480
arm,
grabs my own risks.

1181
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,580
And this is called the Americana arm 
lock.

1182
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:37,710
All yes.
Did you right now and slide my hand down

1183
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,843
and my shoulder will dislocate right 
here and I'll be in excruciating pain 

1184
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:44,220
and I'll either tap or scream fights 
over.

1185
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,960
He wins.
Americana arm lock,

1186
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:46,943
great technique.
And what was that principle and notch 

1187
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,270
position before?
So he's mounted on me.

1188
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,170
Go on my guard.
He don't?

1189
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,030
No,
he don't get to go inside my guard.

1190
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,810
It's called the guard.
Inside my laser.

1191
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,663
Very common position in MMA.
He's going to do the exact same 

1192
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,780
technique,
but watch her dive on it.

1193
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:01,890
He don't drive on it.
Watch what happens

1194
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,220
and now it's like,

1195
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,113
so why the exact same technique was 
completely useless and not only useless 

1196
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,880
but actually dangerous for him using the
technique from a different position.

1197
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:17,980
So as he dives across and go American 
arm lock,

1198
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,120
right,
it looks correct,

1199
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,310
hand grabs his other,
I'm going to go under.

1200
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:22,144
The problem is this,
when you do the Americana from within 

1201
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:25,570
someone's legs,
lock it up,

1202
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,583
they can create an angle on you shoot 
this leg through and they can get up on 

1203
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:31,840
your back.
Because my legs are around,

1204
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:32,674
heat owns body,
I have control of the position even 

1205
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:36,610
though he's applying the right 
submission.

1206
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,820
So the question then becomes,
well what are the implications for this?

1207
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:40,960
You can join us down here,
have a seat there.

1208
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:44,350
And so the question becomes what is this
actual show boomers down here?

1209
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,070
The question becomes what is the 
implication of this in a,

1210
00:54:48,071 --> 00:54:52,270
in an off the mat sense position before 
submission,

1211
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:56,920
the right move from within the wrong 
position is the wrong move.

1212
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,813
So let's just say that you have a 
product or you have a service or a plan 

1213
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,164
of action or something.
And you're offering your product to the 

1214
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,134
marketplace and is not doing well.
Let's say something you're really 

1215
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:07,804
passionate about though,
you're extremely believing in this 

1216
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:10,174
product.
This is your American arm lock and it's 

1217
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:15,400
not doing well in the marketplace where 
you have to reflect on and say,

1218
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:16,234
wait a minute.
If the Americana is something that I 

1219
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:20,140
know I'm supposed to be doing and I'm 
supposed to be selling,

1220
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,300
why isn't it succeeding?
And the question is,

1221
00:55:22,301 --> 00:55:26,290
are you in the right position?
Are you selling it for the right price?

1222
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,363
Are you doing it to,
are you offering it to the right market 

1223
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:30,430
demographic?
Are you,

1224
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,270
are you highlighting the correct and 
most beneficial,

1225
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,030
uh,
benefits or properties of the product or

1226
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:37,864
service?
And to make sure it has the most 

1227
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,083
effective penetration in the market 
place and how he did it for the right 

1228
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:44,860
reasons,
for the principle of service.

1229
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,560
Are you doing this to create common 
zone?

1230
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,230
Is your position correct on what you're 
offering or servicing?

1231
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:51,064
So this is the first one,
transposition position before 

1232
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:55,270
submission.
So you can have the best American if you

1233
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:56,440
do it from the guard,
you're dead.

1234
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,060
If you do it from the mount,
you win the fight.

1235
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,983
Same Americana,
different application position and it's 

1236
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:04,020
completely different effectiveness.
The question is what's your Americana in

1237
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:07,720
your life and are you operating from the
right principal and the right position?

1238
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,070
Failing forward.
You don't get me in the guard.

1239
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,190
You going to do an arm lock right there.
Check this out you guys.

1240
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:13,843
So

1241
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:16,723
the question is in the garden,
beautiful technique for he don't and we 

1242
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:20,174
talked about how before you,
I should not go for the Americana cause 

1243
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,710
he can take my back,
but flip the script.

1244
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,544
Now what can he do from the guard that 
is so amazing if I'm strangling him or 

1245
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:28,390
choking him,
he creates an angle.

1246
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,970
His legs fly up and he breaks my elbow 
right here.

1247
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:31,804
He's holding my wrist,
he's hyper extending my elbow with his 

1248
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:35,170
hips and I either tap or snap right 
here.

1249
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:36,760
It's a done deal.
They're beautiful technique.

1250
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,133
Let's do it again.
And this principles called failing 

1251
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,800
forward so you don't do it.
Go for it,

1252
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,420
spinned for it,
catch it.

1253
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:46,210
Look what happens every my arm out and 
then from here liquidy does.

1254
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,470
Then the fights over.
So what happened right there?

1255
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,300
I ripped my arm out of the arm bar.

1256
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,430
So in a more,
at first glance,

1257
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,510
you look at that and say,
wow,

1258
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,950
the opportunity was stripped away from 
them and 99% of the world would see that

1259
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:04,540
as a lost opportunity.
He sees it as a perfect triangle set up.

1260
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,750
So don't you notice how in society,
and you'll show it one more time.

1261
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:09,100
Then we'll talk about the actual 
application here.

1262
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:11,050
He makes an angle and breaks the arm 
right here.

1263
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,580
When he's going for the arm lock,
he wants my,

1264
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,770
I'm to stay here,
but if I rip this arm out,

1265
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:16,810
he can't do that move anymore because 
this is the wrong arm.

1266
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:17,620
Watch,
try this.

1267
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,300
He can't break this arm because my arm 
bends this way.

1268
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:20,134
It's normal.
It's this arm that he would have liked 

1269
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:22,570
to had broken.
Great.

1270
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,613
So from here,
when that fails and that's no longer 

1271
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,534
available,
this leg just comes around my neck and 

1272
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,384
crosses around my neck and now put it in
the hip turn and I'm completely 

1273
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:32,704
chalkable.

1274
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,173
Not just chalkable,
but specifically because I ripped this 

1275
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,704
arm out.
I'm 100% exposing myself to a better 

1276
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:41,734
technique and the aftermath.
So before we ever apply this as an 

1277
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:47,590
fiddler philosophy,
just as a combat position,

1278
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,290
fasc incredible because you're on the 
line he had on his,

1279
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,360
on the floor,
on your back.

1280
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,433
But from care,
the armbar being available is amazing 

1281
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,313
because this is a technique that I've 
learned in the last few days were very 

1282
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:03,040
beautiful technique.
And then even if that arm is removed,

1283
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,140
if you're conscious enough,
if you're awake enough,

1284
00:58:05,141 --> 00:58:08,110
there is the opportunity to move the leg
to the other side of their head.

1285
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,730
And then you're just saying if you don't
wake it,

1286
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:12,430
the opportunity's there and you're 
prepared to seize it because think about

1287
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,570
this,
no matter who you are,

1288
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:15,520
what your profession is,
what's your passion is,

1289
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:18,460
what's your pursuit is you're going to 
have setbacks,

1290
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,280
there's going to be personal setbacks,
individual,

1291
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,690
your life circumstance,
something happens,

1292
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,830
throws you off your rail.

1293
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:27,880
There's going to be industry setbacks.
Let's say like the comedy industry takes

1294
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:29,310
a hit and no loans going to shows 
anymore.

1295
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,153
Who knows?
Jujitsu just takes a spike and then may 

1296
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:34,260
have whatever there's gonna be an 
industry set back and then there's going

1297
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,094
to be potentially a,
a society setback where there's an 

1298
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:39,064
economic downfall.
Everyone's on a crash and things are 

1299
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,634
tough.
But don't you notice how sometimes in 

1300
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:45,004
the setbacks people losing suffer,
but there's always some superstars who 

1301
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:52,780
come out and they capitalize and they 
win when everyone else is losing.

1302
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,213
Don't you wonder what operating system 
are they on that allows them to 

1303
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,204
capitalize and grow to the extent that 
they are when everyone else seems to be 

1304
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:05,080
failing in the same environment?
Right?

1305
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,153
And the answer is this.
When you are going for the arm bar and 

1306
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,870
an arm rips out and you're mourning the 
loss of the arm bar,

1307
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,980
there is no ability to see the new 
opportunity that's there.

1308
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,980
So the key of this principle called 
failing forward is

1309
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,200
allow unfortunate circumstances to 
happen,

1310
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,720
observed them,
but immediately once they happen,

1311
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:27,860
know that they no longer exist.
It,

1312
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:28,694
that they're there and they move on.
And now what you observe of the present 

1313
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:33,890
situation and what the opportunities are
and there's,

1314
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:34,724
I've never caught a triangle that I 
didn't believe was there or would be 

1315
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:39,890
there.
So when someone rips in our mouth,

1316
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,753
I'm not mourning the loss.
I'm actually expecting the triangle 

1317
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,980
that's going to come next.
So when opportunity meets preparation,

1318
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,040
amazing things will happen.
The challenge for most people is they're

1319
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:49,874
not putting in the preparation time when
everything is going well so that when 

1320
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:57,170
things go bad they can capitalize when 
everyone else is suffering from the loss

1321
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,063
and one so you'll mentality in life or 
on the mat is that when something could 

1322
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:06,020
appear to be a crisis that this is going
to be an opportunity for you.

1323
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,070
Now this is something,
again,

1324
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,023
I have to place this in a framework 
where I understand it and I said to hit 

1325
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,580
on you have a day like in a standup 
comedy situation.

1326
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:14,414
If I'm in a good frame of mind,
if someone shouts something from the 

1327
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,650
audience,
this is brilliant.

1328
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,960
This is an opportunity for me.
I'm going to be funny with that person.

1329
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:23,900
I'm going to talk to that person.
But if I'm feeling nervous that night,

1330
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,601
I just think,
no,

1331
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:26,120
no,
that's messing with my deal.

1332
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,400
This is not how I wanted it to go.
So again,

1333
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:30,800
this is a spiritual principle of non 
attachment.

1334
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:31,634
This is the principle of allowing the 
world to be how it is and responding to 

1335
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:35,744
it rather than thinking your personal 
will is what's important now then you 

1336
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,230
see though,
uh,

1337
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,720
her know that there is a continual hat.
Like if I may,

1338
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:44,554
it seems like there is a tension between
any principal of individual mastery and 

1339
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:52,340
uh,
the principal of sort of of surrender.

1340
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,263
How do you get into this position of 
expertise as martial artists and keep 

1341
01:00:57,501 --> 01:01:00,500
yourself kind of grounded?
How do you do that?

1342
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:05,501
How do you not become yourself over 
incensed by ego too.

1343
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,000
I want this to be the most successful 
university.

1344
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,520
I don't need this to happen,
you know,

1345
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,990
like how do you do that?
Because there is so much,

1346
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,980
you know,
Latin for me,

1347
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:14,300
I have to watch myself from.
I do.

1348
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,130
If I have a lot of things go right for 
me.

1349
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,031
Like,
oh my God,

1350
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:20,330
look how amazing I was in that show.
I have to work quite hard to go.

1351
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,700
You're very lucky you didn't make that 
happen.

1352
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,180
You're lucky you've got born with 
certain abilities at a time where people

1353
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,014
value that,
that you had this luck when you were 

1354
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,170
that age.
When that thing happened to you.

1355
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,123
I have to re tell myself a story because
my natural propensity will be to claim 

1356
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:38,660
it back for the ego to pick the ego 
backup on the doormat on the way out,

1357
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,170
you know?

1358
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,003
So how do you,
so how are you applying continually 

1359
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:42,644
these spiritual principles to maintain 
your own egos in check with the 

1360
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:49,790
successes that you have experienced as,
as Jujitsu wise and as meant?

1361
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,713
It's a good question.
I think what comes to mind for me as 

1362
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,840
cautious optimism.
I'm very optimistic,

1363
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,050
very hopeful.
I hope for the best,

1364
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,330
prepare for the worst mindset,
you know,

1365
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:00,890
so,
um,

1366
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,050
be grateful for what we have.
And I think in Jujitsu,

1367
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:05,180
Jujitsu itself is such a humbling 
practice.

1368
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:09,140
The very nature of what we're doing is 
so humbling to come to the mat,

1369
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,310
train with these guys.
And other,

1370
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,144
you know,
talented training partners and realize 

1371
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:13,101
what,
you know,

1372
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:16,280
what you don't know and continuously 
sharpening that sword that you never get

1373
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:17,114
too high.
But the confidence that drew to gives 

1374
01:02:18,711 --> 01:02:20,100
you also prevents you from ever getting

1375
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,933
too low.
So you stay in this very healthy place 

1376
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,540
that even when things are going 
exceptionally well,

1377
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,820
you know that hey,
I've got to prepare for the worst.

1378
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,400
Now he's got to be thinking about what's
in the accident.

1379
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,690
Growing and planting and Jujitsu is 
three four moves ahead.

1380
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,800
So that game planning for Jujitsu in a 
real fight can be applied to,

1381
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:35,663
you know,
to business and to entrepreneurial-ism 

1382
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,770
100% and I think that believing that you
know,

1383
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,940
things are good,
but things were,

1384
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,240
any of that that's high is going to be 
low.

1385
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,880
Anything that's low is going to be high.
So if you right in the middle and always

1386
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:46,650
planning for the next step,
you're going to have your best chance to

1387
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:47,484
see.
Here's the thing that I've experienced 

1388
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,564
is that I think is perhaps different.
I'm a 12 step person because of the 

1389
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:54,690
alcohol and the drugs and I think 12 
steps is about dealing with crisis.

1390
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,800
This is for people that have been broken
in life and sounded like,

1391
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:02,990
cause I think that I have in a 12 steps 
a philosophy that is very applicable.

1392
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,820
You admit something is a problem,
you believe it could improve,

1393
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,500
you accept help from people or entities 
if you believe in that kind of thing but

1394
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:12,720
more experienced and more powerful than 
you.

1395
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:15,930
Then there were some administrative 
steps and some other principals as well,

1396
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,033
but I think that from what I've 
experienced that this is something that 

1397
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:21,750
becomes relevant when you have become 
broken,

1398
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:25,140
when you have become destroyed,
which does sound comparable to what your

1399
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:26,820
grandfather experienced.
It sounds like a man.

1400
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:27,654
They experience that kind of humiliation
of some kind and it's a experience of 

1401
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:33,660
humiliation.
So you're saying that when you're,

1402
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,480
like earlier in the conversation we 
talked about how Brazilian Jujitsu,

1403
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:41,040
we will be applicable to a wide 
demographics to children that are afraid

1404
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:41,874
to,
people that are worried about sexual 

1405
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:47,400
assault to law enforces so,
but it seems to me as well that these,

1406
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:48,930
you know,
the reason I'm interested in this,

1407
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:49,764
of course I'm excited by a martial art 
where people see more brilliant and 

1408
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:52,560
glamorous.

1409
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,393
I love that who doesn't?
But what was more important to me is 

1410
01:03:55,951 --> 01:04:00,600
that it seemed philosophically flexible 
and applicable beyond even the,

1411
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,490
you know,
as we've just discussed beyond the realm

1412
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:05,160
of the martial art,
I feel like,

1413
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:09,780
I feel like a Jujitsu practice is like,
you know,

1414
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:10,614
a week out in everyday life.
Like thinking about the things that go 

1415
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:14,334
down in one practice,
especially when you're fighting against 

1416
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:20,730
each other,
you're experiencing so many hardships.

1417
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,440
You're failing,
right?

1418
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,750
You're being outsmarted,
you're being manipulated.

1419
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,793
These things are happening to you while 
you're grappling were being tricked and 

1420
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:31,950
you know,
we were being threatened.

1421
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,860
You feel like you're under pressure.
You're,

1422
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,590
there's the risk of injury.
There's all these things happening.

1423
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,100
Especially right now amongst us to as 
black belts finding each other.

1424
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,000
Yeah.
How is that?

1425
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,500
When there is,
it's,

1426
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:44,334
it's like a war.
So when these things go down and we'd 

1427
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,950
learned to deal with things,
these things on the spot,

1428
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,610
on the spot,
I experience immense threat.

1429
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,493
Yeah.
I mean I have to fall back and use what 

1430
01:04:57,181 --> 01:04:59,610
I've learned my whole life with that 
threat.

1431
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,620
So I just practiced it like you talked 
about earlier in our 10 minute session,

1432
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:09,060
we did a fight.
So three days later when I feel threat,

1433
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,220
I'm,
I'm at home.

1434
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,690
I feel threat every day.

1435
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,593
He said it,
you know,

1436
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,210
everything you experienced in a,
in a,

1437
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,633
you know,
five or 10 minute Jujitsu training 

1438
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:20,434
session that that presents all the 
emotions and highs and lows of a month 

1439
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:24,694
or six months of the average person 
experiencing it out in life or business 

1440
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:31,480
or personal relationships.
So we're basically creating these,

1441
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,500
this petri dish of experimentation and 
have constant,

1442
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,150
a refinement of our ability to handle 
those outside stimuli,

1443
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,931
uh,
in a,

1444
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:42,130
in a,
in a fighting stance.

1445
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,053
And let's be honest.
When you can be comfortable applying 

1446
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:49,330
your living principles in a fight 
against another human being,

1447
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,030
then there's nothing that you're going 
to be uncomfortable dealing with.

1448
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:55,370
I think in my own personal psychology as
a mountain,

1449
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,950
and that's the only gender I'm qualified
to speak for the age informs a lot of my

1450
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:00,784
behavior way beyond actual conflict.
I think the imagined threat of conflict 

1451
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,690
really informs me psychologically.

1452
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,231
I've,
you know,

1453
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:11,130
and fear as a phenomenon and what I 
sense is,

1454
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:14,680
is that if I personally spent time 
around this kind of energy,

1455
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,260
it gives me a different sense of 
groundedness.

1456
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:20,380
He opened out my spirituality into 
another area.

1457
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:21,214
It seems like,
uh,

1458
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,650
uh,
it seems like something I've neglected a

1459
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:27,130
lot in life and something that it feels 
like it's a good puzzle piece.

1460
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,710
It connects me in a way that's very,
it's fascinating to me.

1461
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,270
It really means when I look at people,
I want to look at every single person on

1462
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:37,720
this planet and look at them and feel 
good.

1463
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,420
I don't want to look at someone and feel
like,

1464
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,520
ah,
you know,

1465
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:45,670
what?
An anger or fear or anything negative.

1466
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,500
I only want to feel good and no matter 
how negative they are.

1467
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,790
So I just think about myself as a,
you know,

1468
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,470
a spiritual and a balanced person.

1469
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,783
You know,
Jujitsu allows me to be the best person 

1470
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,320
I can be.
The nicest,

1471
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,380
most peaceful person of all.
Everybody says the very common quote is,

1472
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:09,670
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

1473
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,600
That's why I do Jujitsu cause I'm a 
lover,

1474
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:16,990
not a fighter.
There's no question about it.

1475
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:17,873
If you've been in those sessions,
a lot of it did seem more like fighting 

1476
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:22,360
and loving.
You were fighting,

1477
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:26,380
he was loving.
But think about how if you don't want to

1478
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:28,620
do the martial large because you're a 
lover,

1479
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,750
what that means is when you're 
threatened,

1480
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,003
how are you going to defend yourself by 
hurting the person because you don't 

1481
01:07:35,161 --> 01:07:35,994
know how to do it any other way.
You can only hurt the person to defend 

1482
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:40,500
yourself.
Me and the other hand,

1483
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:44,220
I practice fighting all day.
So when you attack me,

1484
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,623
I can love you back.
I think it would be remiss to her to 

1485
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:52,400
wrap up this interview without me being 
involved in some demonstration of a move

1486
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,850
because I've realized I've really,
really loved this conversation.

1487
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,130
I've loved hanging out at the Gracie 
University Gracie Academy for this week.

1488
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:58,964
It's been brilliant.
I can't endorse it hardly enough but 

1489
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:02,114
like a,
I think it like the punch block series 

1490
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:04,924
and the guards and we showed them the 
one that we had worked on in stages one 

1491
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:07,364
through four.
Have you seen you guys reviewed some of 

1492
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:08,744
that?
We did it.

1493
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,890
We did it.
Let's do it.

1494
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:10,723
So let's talk about,
and this is comfort and worst case 

1495
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:13,970
scenarios.
This is come from worst case scenarios,

1496
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,960
the next peaceable and beautifully you 
want to go out.

1497
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:17,621
So we're going to do it.
Yeah,

1498
01:08:17,621 --> 01:08:18,454
you wanna get his guard going to do it.
I'll talk to the principal here and 

1499
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:21,104
Russell we'll be doing here with here in
the bottom of the guard right here off 

1500
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,583
my Westham soc.
So that would be something of that 

1501
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,310
football club.
So yeah,

1502
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,640
you guys want to slide down south a 
little bit.

1503
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,900
Come down a little bit.
So in the guard,

1504
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:30,734
wrap him up in Stage one russell,
you have head control arm control here 

1505
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,940
real quick.
Wrap me up in stage.

1506
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,830
He lands down here.
It has no plan.

1507
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:39,410
Worst case scenario,
so imagine it Russell.

1508
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:41,510
Imagine being here with zero gt to 
knowledge.

1509
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,480
What would someone do in your position 
who knew nothing right now?

1510
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,343
The panic,
panic protect their face and he would 

1511
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,640
just drop bombs through the cage,
around the corner in the body.

1512
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,980
You're going to eventually get opened up
and getting knocked down from you.

1513
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:53,720
This they're actually for most people 
watching.

1514
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,733
This is actually worst case scenario.
But when you understand Jujitsu and you 

1515
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,080
understand a little bit of distance 
management concept,

1516
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,480
which Russell has learned from us,
we can demonstrate it now.

1517
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:07,400
It's a series of stages to mitigate this
threat and be able to stay safe and calm

1518
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,090
as a result of that.

1519
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,520
So stage one is when Russell had him 
wrapped up,

1520
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:13,050
get inside and hug his head.
Rustled the head and arm control that we

1521
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:15,020
talked about yet.
Wrap that arm and you're here.

1522
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:16,640
This is called stage one.
And then if,

1523
01:09:16,641 --> 01:09:19,190
let's say we're here and he don't start 
trying to pull body punches,

1524
01:09:19,191 --> 01:09:21,440
bring your knee and side Russell and 
that stage to other knee.

1525
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:24,530
So now he's blocking punches at the 
second stage of protection.

1526
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,240
If he don't sits up,
he's on his chest,

1527
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:27,074
rust it,
look at that.

1528
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,090
He's blocking now at stage three now he 
don't,

1529
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:30,800
can't reach punches from there cause 
it's too far.

1530
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,080
And if he stands up stage,
you don't on the hips,

1531
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,003
this is called stage four.
So with all these stages you noticed 

1532
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:38,450
that how he was never at the range to 
knock you out.

1533
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,070
And then from there punch punch,
let him back in,

1534
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:40,904
rust,
wrap his head up and he's back to stage 

1535
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:41,840
one.

1536
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,300
So it's a cycle and you can go from 
stage one to stage three,

1537
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:45,134
stayed up to three right there and he's 
on his chest book or for Direct Punch 

1538
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,561
Punch.
Let him back in.

1539
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:49,310
Boom,
boom.

1540
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,143
And he pulls him back down.
So to be able to meet and what happens 

1541
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:53,144
throughout all these exchanges,
he's burning energy trying to hit you 

1542
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,860
and you're just managing the distance.
So we can't knock you out.

1543
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,900
So he's exhausting while you're 
preserving,

1544
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,170
having a lovely cuddle,
if you relax,

1545
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:05,540
if you relax like we talked about,
and don't tense up to me,

1546
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,220
why are you doing it?
Why south tense?

1547
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:10,040
It's me.
And then you control from here.

1548
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:10,874
And then we have your triangle.
Why don't you do to try and bring your 

1549
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:13,670
own inside of the here?
Bring your knee inside.

1550
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:16,370
So that's where you push his arm away.
Bring your knee inside his arm slowly.

1551
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,510
Yeah,
she didn't comes in.

1552
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:18,344
Now slide two is risk to your boss and 
I'll pull your leg up and around his 

1553
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:20,810
neck.
Beautiful.

1554
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:22,070
Cross that leg.
Get the arm across.

1555
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,810
Shoves his arm over and I'll grab his 
head.

1556
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:25,280
He'd lock your legs up nice and tight 
there.

1557
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,890
Squeeze your thighs together,
grab your Shin tight thighs.

1558
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,240
Everything's squeezed down and pull your
head down,

1559
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:30,830
puts his head down.
Squeeze your driver's head,

1560
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:31,880
grab his head.
You Think,

1561
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,920
oh,
he's said s six seconds.

1562
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,950
And that principle right there is called
the wind wind principle.

1563
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,200
You do the move you,
he taps out and you let go.

1564
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,450
Everybody wins.
If you could think about this,

1565
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,290
you didn't hurt me,
hurt my ego.

1566
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:46,543
He neutralized,
probably went for a triangle and I feel 

1567
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:52,400
a little pressure on my neck and then I 
tap or I cough a little bit and then you

1568
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:53,180
release.

1569
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,013
You didn't,
he didn't punch my face and break my 

1570
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:57,440
nose and have to let go of me and say,
Hey,

1571
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,690
is everything cool here?
And I kind of like,

1572
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:00,524
you know,
half fell asleep but say I pass out a 

1573
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,550
little bit and now we can stand up and 
have a cup of tea.

1574
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,230
There doesn't have to be this.
No alcohol.

1575
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,550
That was cause I'm English,
right.

1576
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:08,720
No,
no alcohol.

1577
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,730
That's lovely to be able to neutralize 
the threat for the,

1578
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,260
to be able to put out the fire without 
adding more fire to it.

1579
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,313
Yes.
She able to stop violence without 

1580
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:19,674
violence.
Do you see how this is so applicable to 

1581
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,970
bulletproof and into a child who's 
getting bullied?

1582
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,590
Because if you have a child,
what you do,

1583
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,540
congratulations.
And they're growing up three,

1584
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:27,871
four,
five,

1585
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,704
six years old and someone's picking on 
them and you didn't have Jujitsu to 

1586
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,340
teach them,
you would say,

1587
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:33,174
hey child,
go over there and punch him in the nose 

1588
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:38,220
because you don't have another resource 
to help them stand up for themselves.

1589
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:43,140
And then you basically turn your child 
into the bully to fight the bully.

1590
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,093
But Jujitsu is,
it's such a gentle approach to the same 

1591
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:47,064
threats that it neutralizes it.
And they could literally be friends 

1592
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:51,510
after the altercation is complete.
My children,

1593
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,403
they will not even call Jujitsu fighting
if the time comes where they're getting 

1594
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:56,334
bullied and they're at seven years old 
and nine years old and they start doing 

1595
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,690
Jujitsu,
they didn't fight the kid at school.

1596
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:04,290
They just controlled the situation.
If we think of it as fighting,

1597
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,870
then we're gonna turn our kids do this.
No,

1598
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:11,400
change your idea of what it means for 
your kids to stand up for themselves and

1599
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:13,190
fight back.
When you use Fujitsu,

1600
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,960
you're not fighting back.
That's an [inaudible].

1601
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:21,110
I've already fought that mark.
I want to teach my doula mabel that like

1602
01:12:21,111 --> 01:12:24,360
that.
You know when she says I am angry to say

1603
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:24,751
no,
no,

1604
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:25,530
you're not angry.

1605
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:28,140
Just in this moment you are experiencing
anger.

1606
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,003
The anger will pass,
but you are saying that you could 

1607
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:32,130
reframe the whole way they see the 
world,

1608
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:32,964
but even a situation which a lot of 
people live with fear of physical 

1609
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,480
violence,
you could see it as just as,

1610
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,390
oh this is that thing happening where I 
do the gentle cuddling of Jujitsu.

1611
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:45,060
We'd be doing this on your do a on the 
at home with them just on the carpet.

1612
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:45,894
You just played Jujitsu so they won't 
hesitate to tackle the kid that's been 

1613
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:51,300
bugging them for the last year.
They don't see that as a fight.

1614
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:52,134
They see that as a,
as a physical resolution to a threat 

1615
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:56,820
scenario,
but not as a violent proposition.

1616
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:57,654
Therefore,
there should be no barrier to prevent 

1617
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,440
them from doing what they need to do 
because the biggest problem,

1618
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,810
and we did a video of this recently with
our friend Vince Vaughn,

1619
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:04,644
who's also a student,
and we talked about this concept of the 

1620
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:11,670
biggest kind of threatened concern you 
have for kids in schools is not even the

1621
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:12,000
bully.

1622
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,730
It's the policies that are implemented 
to try to prevent bullying,

1623
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,490
the called zero tolerance kind of 
bullying policies,

1624
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,070
which means if someone's teasing you,
that's wrong,

1625
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,080
but if you stand up for yourself,
you're also wrong.

1626
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:22,914
So you're going to both get in trouble.
And that's a problem because then a 

1627
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:25,704
child is paralyzed by a policy and will 
not defend themselves because they're 

1628
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:29,934
not allowed to fight at school.
Anybody who is involved in a fight is 

1629
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:32,910
wrong.
Both kids get suspended.

1630
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,730
So you have a policy that's meant to 
help the victims of bullying,

1631
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:39,450
but it actually enables the bullies 
because if I tease you and poke you,

1632
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,680
I know you can't stand up for yourself 
because you'll get in trouble if you do.

1633
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:44,663
So the good kids are handcuffed.
The bad kids take advantage of the fact 

1634
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:48,444
that no one else can stand up to them 
and they can get away with all the 

1635
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:52,890
bullying they want.
So it's a parent's job to say,

1636
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,790
Hey,
son or daughter,

1637
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,620
whatever the school policy is,
don't worry.

1638
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:56,454
You can always do your self defense.
You can always neutralize any threat 

1639
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:03,000
against you in a nonviolent way and 
you're never going to be wrong with me.

1640
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,150
And if it's wrong with the school,
all deal with the school myself.

1641
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,013
But if a child needs to hear that from 
their parents and otherwise they remain 

1642
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,120
handcuffs serious.

1643
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,740
And back to what you said when you're in
the principal's office.

1644
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,930
Yes.
You know you're in trouble for fighting.

1645
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,630
I wasn't fighting principal.
I wasn't fighting.

1646
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,473
I was just neutral.
You would be the person talking to them 

1647
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:22,930
with a whole,
I didn't fight.

1648
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,920
I didn't punch him.
I want to make them.

1649
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,160
I just held him down until the teacher 
came fighting his punches and kicks.

1650
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:29,110
What world are you from?
This is very beautiful.

1651
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:31,120
I think that you have reframing a lot of
things.

1652
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:34,620
You're reframing fear,
you're reframing conflict and come back.

1653
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,990
You're helping me to address things I 
think like the psychological issues that

1654
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:41,500
probably laying about in the landscape 
of my mind and addressed for a very long

1655
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:42,490
time.
Very,

1656
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:45,250
very grateful to both of you.
Thank you very much.

1657
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,860
[inaudible] gracie on,
or if you come visit us,

1658
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:48,694
man,
come anytime and hopefully you can make 

1659
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:52,810
it down to California more often.
We can roll more.

1660
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:53,644
We can talk more.
I'm going to be doing a lot of pushups 

1661
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,033
between now and when I next see you.
I think you're going to be impressed 

1662
01:14:58,421 --> 01:15:01,150
with the results.
Thank you so much.

1663
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:01,920
Thanks,
John.

1664
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,090
Thank you for your Nice,
wow.
