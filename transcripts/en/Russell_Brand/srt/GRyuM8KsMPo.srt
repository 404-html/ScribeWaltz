00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,140
Jason hickl is an anthropologist at the 
London School of Economics.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,003
Originally from Swaziland.
He spent a number of years living with 

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,064
migrant workers in South Africa studying
patterns of exploitation and political 

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:16,800
resistance in the wake of apartheid.
Alongside is ethnographic work.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,843
He writes about development inequality 
and global political economy for the 

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,840
Guardian and other online outlets.
His new book,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,763
the divide,
a brief guide to global inequality and 

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,590
it solutions is out now.
Jason,

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,680
welcome to under the skin.
Thank you for having me.

10
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,930
Russell.
Is it an honor to have you on?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,100
You're actually a doctor.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,970
I am,
although not the kind of,

13
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:41,410
it can save your life,
sadly.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,720
Good.
Because you know,

15
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,554
I mean,
we could talk about medicine and all 

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,504
that kind of stuff,
but I'm much more interested in talking 

17
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,300
to you about,
uh,

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,883
global inequality.
I thought one things after sort of like 

19
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,640
recently having had,
um,

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,663
Al Gore on the show for example,
and talking about huge issue like 

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,000
climate change.
It's interesting,

22
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,210
I feel to listen to the framework within
which these conversations,

23
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:12,670
particularly conversations about 
significant change at,

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,150
they take place within a sort of an 
identifiable framework.

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,013
I wonder if you could talk to us,
give us a bit of an overview of global 

26
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,020
inequality,
uh,

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,390
how it,
how things stand economically,

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,480
how we got into this position,
and then we'll crack on from there.

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,803
Well,
I suppose the place to start is what do 

30
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:33,444
we presently think about global 
inequality and what's kind of happening 

31
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,780
in the world?
So there's,

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,673
there's actually a dominant narrative 
out there that comes out of the World 

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,763
Bank predominantly and gets repeated in 
the media quite often that global 

34
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,810
inequality on,
again,

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,800
a global scale is actually diminishing 
along with globalization.

36
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,663
So we know for a fact that globalization
has caused inequality rates within 

37
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:57,210
countries to get worse,
but the arguments from the World Bank is

38
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,010
that on a global scale,
it's getting better.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,320
So the media picks us up.
Uh,

40
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,730
again,
this happened most recently,

41
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,650
a couple of years ago,
and argues that,

42
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,484
look,
globalization is actually good for the 

43
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,370
poor of the world.
Uh,

44
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,210
you know,
it's working.

45
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,400
We should keep doing it because it's the
moral thing to do.

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,330
So what's interesting is if you look 
behind those statistics,

47
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,690
you find that there are actually quite 
misleading because a,

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
they think about global inequality,
um,

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,553
uh,
as if everybody in the world is part of 

50
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,710
the same big country,
right?

51
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,890
And so on that basis,
it does appear that global inequality is

52
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:29,724
diminishing,
but only if you include China and East 

53
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,220
Asia.
Now,

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,100
interestingly,
the,

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,020
that's the only part of the world that 
has not been forcibly globalized,

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,913
um,
by the Washington consensus under US 

57
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,910
pressure since the 1980s.
They basically,

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,033
uh,
transform their economies according to 

59
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,044
their own standards.
So it doesn't really work to have the 

60
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,050
narrative work that way.
Now,

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,080
and here's the crucial point.
If you look at global inequality between

62
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:52,914
regions of the world,
between say the global north and the 

63
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,000
global south or rich countries versus 
poor countries,

64
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,610
what we see is that rather than 
diminishing global inequality is getting

65
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,530
dramatically worse since the 1960s,
uh,

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,433
the,
the per capita income gap between the 

67
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:09,070
north and the south rich countries and 
poor countries has tripled in size.

68
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,930
And that's really,
that's really a dramatic,

69
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,330
to me,
a dramatic condemnation of,

70
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,223
uh,
of globalization and pointing out that 

71
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,230
it's just not working for the vast 
majority of humanity.

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,880
Um,
the majority of,

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,600
of the yields of global capitalism are 
going to rich countries.

74
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,590
I think that's a big problem.

75
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,243
I suppose in a way it would be obvious 
that globalization would increase 

76
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,174
inequality is globalization is a term 
which really covers the power of 

77
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,451
transnational corporations to have one 
market place regulate it in a way that's

78
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:45,974
beneficial to them.
So it kind of makes sense that that 

79
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,094
would mean that money was traveling in a
particular direction and it wouldn't be 

80
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,680
beneficial to the poorest and most 
vulnerable people.

81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,350
How,
how are these myths sustained,

82
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,880
Jason?
These ideas like,

83
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,893
like trickle down economics and mass 
production that the ultimately all in 

84
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:05,170
it.
Like how,

85
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,750
how often have nearly a century,
uh,

86
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,693
or these kind of ideas sustained.
Is it kind of a form of propaganda and 

87
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,300
the management it's the same stakes as 
you've already mentioned?

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,540
Yeah.
Um,

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,433
first I just want to briefly touch on 
what you mentioned just now with 

90
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,550
trickled down.
So if you look at,

91
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,423
um,
at all of the new income generated by 

92
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,830
global GDP growth over the past couple 
of decades,

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,873
GDP,
gross domestic products basically 

94
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:31,110
measured as the s the increasing size of
the global economy.

95
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,173
Um,
only 5% of all new income generated by 

96
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,790
global growth has gone to the poorest 
60% of humanity.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,550
So that's an extremely slow rate of 
trickle down.

98
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,090
Yeah.

99
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,910
It's barely trickling down at all.
It won't even get there.

100
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,150
It'll be a vapor by the time it's 
halfway down.

101
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,710
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

102
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,723
And economists have pointed out that at 
that rate of trickle down to eradicate 

103
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:53,864
poverty from the face of the earth,
which is what we technically 

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,030
theoretically want to be doing,
a would take over 200 years.

105
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,710
That's how slow it trickles down.

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,980
If there was any intention to actually 
eradicate poverty,

107
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:04,690
this is not the means by which she would
do it,

108
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:05,524
then.
Okay.

109
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,190
That is definitely true.
And that's what,

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,280
that's basically the argument that I 
make in my book,

111
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,780
the divide.
Um,

112
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,130
the reason to have intention to 
eradicate poverty,

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,330
hobbies necessary is in it for the 
global economic model.

114
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:17,820
Hey,
see,

115
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,340
you're an anthropologist,
doesn't ever,

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,280
apologies means study if she human 
behavior.

117
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,861
Yes,
that's,

118
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,940
yeah,
that's anthropology.

119
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,590
Uh,
so my,

120
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,424
um,
my anthropological work is focused on a 

121
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,850
particular part of the world that South 
Africa.

122
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,070
I'm originally from Swaziland,
so it's quite close to where I'm from.

123
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,293
And again,
I look at patterns of migration and 

124
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,560
exploitation in that region,
but uh,

125
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,423
but just I guess just by virtue of 
having grown up in Swaziland and then 

126
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,020
moving to the states from a university 
and phd,

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,101
um,
you know,

128
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:45,934
I was really grappling with this 
question of why are some countries so 

129
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,144
immensely rich and consume so much while
other countries are so miserably poor 

130
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,400
and have been for such a long time.
Uh,

131
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,234
so I guess that's the question of,
of why the is divided as it is 

132
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:58,964
economically as really exercise me.
And that kind of led me on this really 

133
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,414
10 or more your journey to,
to understand more about how the global 

134
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,240
economy works and write that up in a way
that the average person can understand.

135
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,263
So the aspect of anthropology,
the interests you is the movement of 

136
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,970
resources and capital.
And systems of dominance.

137
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,690
And after your decade of research 
leading to this book of yours,

138
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,524
the divide,
what are your most important 

139
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,430
observations?
And uh,

140
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:24,264
I'm glad that you said in a language 
that anyone can understand cause I'm 

141
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,320
anyone.
So can you put it in a,

142
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,720
tell us what your most important 
observations are?

143
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,783
Well,
so I want to go back to the question 

144
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,490
that you asked earlier about it's going 
to be,

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,060
I'm going to ultimately answer the 
question you just asked right now.

146
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,920
You mentioned this thing about 
narrative,

147
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:39,760
right?
Uh,

148
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:42,040
what's the narrative that sort of keeps 
the system chugging along?

149
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,350
And it was a brilliant question 
actually.

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,810
So,
and I think that probably,

151
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,610
uh,
you know,

152
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,510
the,
the center of this narrative is that,

153
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,100
um,
you know,

154
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,053
rich countries have become rich based on
their own hard work and they have the 

155
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,710
right policies and there's smart,
etc.

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,110
Etc.
Whereas poor countries or poor because,

157
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,101
uh,
you know,

158
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,540
they have internal policy failures.
Maybe they're corrupt me that maybe they

159
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,180
have bad climates,
not enough resources,

160
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,014
et Cetera,
et cetera.

161
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,003
Um,
but rich countries a very generous and 

162
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,464
what they do is they give generously of 
their surplus across the divide to poor 

163
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,410
countries to help them sort of a up the 
development ladder.

164
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,740
And so we hear this all the time from 
our politicians talking about the,

165
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,880
uh,
the international aid budget,

166
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:21,550
the foreign aid budget,
and on a global scale,

167
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:22,384
the foreign aid budget that flows from 
rich countries to poor countries is 

168
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,940
huge.
It's $130 billion per year right now.

169
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,470
That sounds like a lot of money.
And it is,

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,513
that's about the a,
the equivalent of all of the profits of 

171
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:35,170
all of the commercial banks in the u s 
combines,

172
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,010
uh,
that,

173
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,660
that goes from north to south every 
year.

174
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,190
But,
um,

175
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,080
if you look at all the money that flows 
around the world,

176
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,920
way more flows from south to north on an
order of magnitude,

177
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,090
then trickles the other way.
And I think that is really the,

178
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,920
uh,
the key point that we need to make here.

179
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,520
The aid is not flowing from north to 
south.

180
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,170
It's flowing from south to north.

181
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,183
It's flowing in reverse.
So basically poor countries are 

182
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:56,794
developing rich countries,
rich countries are not developing for 

183
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,920
our countries,
so that they're the,

184
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,950
the,
that that flows from north to South East

185
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:03,784
contextualized his aid and that that 
flows from south to north is content's 

186
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:10,390
job contextualized as good business is 
economics.

187
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:14,050
But really you would taste sort of post 
colonial exploitation.

188
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,220
Yeah,
you can see it as,

189
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,630
as plunder or you can see it as tributes
and,

190
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,090
but he,
here's a really important fact.

191
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,980
So,
and this is actually quite recent data.

192
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,130
Uh,
so I guess it was a December or January,

193
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,993
um,
an an institute in Washington DC called 

194
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,154
global financial integrity,
partnered with the Norwegian School of 

195
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,873
economics to do the most comprehensive 
study of financial flows around the 

196
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,570
world ever conducted in the world,
uh,

197
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,493
in history.
And what they've found is that poor 

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,730
countries are net creditors to rich 
countries,

199
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,440
um,
uh,

200
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,313
to,
uh,

201
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,183
on such a scale that for every dollar of
aid that port can receive from which 

202
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,020
countries,
uh,

203
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,820
they lose $24 in net outflows,
right?

204
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,863
I mean,
so basically the south is effectively 

205
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,063
hemorrhaging to the north.
And this happens through all sorts of 

206
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,044
flows,
like,

207
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,983
um,
illicit financial flows that basically 

208
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,104
corporations stealing money out of poor 
countries and s and storing them in tax 

209
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,630
havens,
uh,

210
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,880
many of which are controlled by the 
city.

211
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,510
London.
When you say stealing money,

212
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,520
what do you mean by what means?

213
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,080
Uh,
yeah,

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
so this,
there's a mechanism called,

215
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,620
uh,
called trade miss invoicing.

216
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,650
And basically the way this works is that
a company will,

217
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,484
uh,
we'll falsify it's trade invoices when 

218
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:23,140
it's exporting goods out of a poor 
country into a rich country.

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,290
Right.
Um,

220
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,950
and by doing that,
it can actually end up taking,

221
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,520
uh,
taking money offshore,

222
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,090
putting in a tax haven.
And it's very difficult for customers to

223
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,260
stop this.
Um,

224
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:35,950
it's a practice that's been legalized 
basically by the WTO since 1994.

225
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,450
Um,
again,

226
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,284
and the WTO of course,
is controlled largely by rich countries 

227
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:40,774
since they have the bargaining power.
So they were able to sort of establish 

228
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:42,934
this rule,
which is deeply detrimental to poor 

229
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,124
countries,

230
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,090
but he's like apparently neutral 
governing and regulate.

231
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:48,924
We bodies are in fact,
in a way the administrative henchman of 

232
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,604
a system of globalization.
It's based on exploitation of poor 

233
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:57,990
countries.

234
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,220
Yeah,
that's a good way to put it.

235
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,990
I should write that in my next book.
Cancer.

236
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,190
Um,
yeah,

237
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,630
so you know,
so if you look at,

238
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,330
if you look at just illicit financial 
flows alone,

239
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,463
uh,
then that's over 1 trillion US dollars 

240
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,220
that flows from,
from poor to rich every year,

241
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,380
uh,
which outstrips the aid budget itself by

242
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,214
a factor of 10 a right.
And there's all sorts of all sorts of 

243
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,370
other flows like,
um,

244
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,090
like the interest payments on foreign 
loans that port companies have to pay,

245
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,283
um,
profit repatriation from multinational 

246
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:27,950
companies,
uh,

247
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,853
et Cetera,
et cetera.

248
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,570
I suppose part of your point then,
Jason,

249
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,703
is that many of the systems that we 
consider to be sort of objective and 

250
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,290
just are kind of administrative 
fictions,

251
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,700
perhaps the economy itself and even 
something like a GDP,

252
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,910
it's just an idea.
It's not earn an objective reality.

253
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,930
Is that part of what you're saying mate?

254
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,921
Yeah,
no,

255
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,040
absolutely.
Uh,

256
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,330
and I'll definitely want to talk a bit 
more about GDP and how that is a fiction

257
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:00,160
of our imagination that's become quite 
destructive.

258
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,180
But,
um,

259
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,073
but just to,
just to go back to what you were saying 

260
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:03,844
earlier about these admin administrative
bodies who Ronnie sketch sharing a 

261
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,740
question.
Well,

262
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,253
you mentioned,
you mentioned these global 

263
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,960
administrative bodies and it's not just 
the WTO,

264
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,640
it's also like the World Bank and the 
IMF.

265
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,803
So look at Netherlands,

266
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,260
those acronyms,
acronyms.

267
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,860
I've always fought IMF wb out of ways.
Like whenever I see stuff happening near

268
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
dodgy.

269
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,270
Oh they,
they are definitely dodged.

270
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,240
And here's the deal is that the World 
Bank,

271
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,413
the international monetary funds are a,
are basically the institutions that 

272
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,290
control the rules of the global economy 
right now.

273
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,124
And here's the thing,
they're profoundly anti democratic 

274
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,460
institutions.
So rich countries,

275
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,830
which have a minority of the population 
of the world,

276
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,943
um,
half about 50% of the vote in these 

277
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:44,884
institutions,
the u s government has a veto over all 

278
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,880
major decisions made in these 
institutions.

279
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,400
The whole thing's pointless anyway.
I mean,

280
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,350
yeah,
it's deeply,

281
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,710
it's a deeply compromised system.
I think it's a,

282
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,800
and for me,
you know,

283
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,590
the problem is primarily that it's 
anti-democratic.

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,810
If you were to,
uh,

285
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,460
um,
you know,

286
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,140
open up the WTO and World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund.

287
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,983
See real democratic practice doesn't 
give poor countries a fair voice in how 

288
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,050
the global economy is run.
Definitely we would see dramatic change.

289
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,100
Okay.
Shell oven buggering about with it.

290
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,791
So,
okay,

291
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,090
so that'd be a o Imf,
all those things I keep,

292
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:23,070
I know I'm listing boxing organizations 
now called the mcgregor fight,

293
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,780
fill it bay where I say that.
Um,

294
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,423
hey,
give us some more of those statistics 

295
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,190
there.
Sort of a mind boggling like,

296
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:35,490
uh,
like how can we,

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,833
how can a,
an ongoing narrative and narrative be 

298
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:44,331
the depletion of poverty when you EGA 
billion people are living on less than a

299
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,353
dollar a day.
And the one that saw voice clumps me in 

300
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:47,904
the face when I read it,
the richest eight people in the world 

301
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:53,780
control the same amount of wealth is the
poorest half of the world's fault.

302
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,120
That's a killer facts.
It's horrible.

303
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,493
Um,
so I want to go to the poverty number 

304
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,560
that you just mentioned.
So,

305
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,060
and that sounds about Nicole.
She said,

306
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,300
I don't have a system now that's,
uh,

307
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,590
you know,
the world,

308
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,740
the World Bank and the UN are telling us
that,

309
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,933
uh,
the number of poor people in the world 

310
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,980
is between 700 million and 1 billion 
people basically right now.

311
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,163
Um,
and what they've been saying is that 

312
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,810
that number has been decreasing over the
past 15 or so years.

313
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,610
Um,
because of their,

314
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,490
the way the good things that are doing 
basically through aid and so on.

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,833
Um,
but if you look at how they measure 

316
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:28,964
poverty,
uh,

317
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,320
there's a real problem at stake.
Um,

318
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,590
that that number comes from a poverty 
line.

319
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,440
That's a dollar 25 per day right now.
Um,

320
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,383
scholars from all over the world have 
been pointing out that nobody can live 

321
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,270
on a dollar 25 a day.
It's a totally ludicrous,

322
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,100
immoral number.
Uh,

323
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:50,180
so in order to achieve the most basic 
levels of human subsistence,

324
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,550
uh,
to achieve normal human life expectancy,

325
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,563
you know,
to have a decent chance of surviving 

326
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,410
pastor fifth birthday,
etc.

327
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,770
Etc.
You have to have at least $5 per day,

328
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,720
right?
As like a moral minimum.

329
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,160
They called us the ethical poverty line.

330
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,700
Let me just get below that moral 
minimum.

331
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,560
Exactly.
So here's the thing.

332
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,423
If you measure,
if you measure global poverty at that 

333
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:09,584
level,
then it's not 1 billion people in 

334
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,070
poverty.
It's 4.3

335
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:13,904
billion people in poverty,
which is 60% of the world's population 

336
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,460
and the number has been getting bigger 
over time,

337
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,050
not getting smaller.
And so again,

338
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:23,150
I think that the narrative that we have,
um,

339
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,730
that comes out of some of these bodies 
that don't worry,

340
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,210
poverty is a diminishing and equalities 
diminishing is just not true.

341
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,430
And if you look at the scholarship 
behind it,

342
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,490
we see exactly the opposite story.
And so we really have to ask ourselves,

343
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,220
why is the global economy is so 
fundamentally flawed?

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,710
This to fix this problem,
to make it fair,

345
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,773
um,
is going to require more than just 

346
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:44,210
tweaking around the edges of the bit of 
aid here and there,

347
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,363
uh,
but rather fundamentally reorganizing 

348
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,354
the system.

349
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,763
How on Earth,
what will you fundamentally reorganized 

350
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,943
system when the system is clearly 
beneficial to the people that control 

351
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,234
it?

352
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,460
That's a good question.
So,

353
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,553
so,
um,

354
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,180
you know,
I guess you can think about it this way,

355
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,130
um,
in terms of is this possible or not?

356
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,170
Uh,
so I have lots of students,

357
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,940
a lot,
a lot of my students come in like,

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,833
you know,
deeply concerned about poverty and 

359
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,860
inequality and so on.
Um,

360
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,290
and they get really interested in,
in,

361
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,440
uh,
in solutions like,

362
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,170
you know,
micro finance or foreign aid or whatever

363
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:19,430
it might be.
Um,

364
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,743
uh,
but the problem is that the solutions 

365
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,544
that they're interested in don't 
actually target the real structural 

366
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:28,130
causes of the problems that they are so 
concerned to address.

367
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,360
If we can,
if we can get messages out to,

368
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,203
to,
to these students who fill the 

369
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,284
development industry and all the 
development organizations that are out 

370
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,650
there that are trying to tackle these 
problems,

371
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,890
that what we need is to tackle these,
the,

372
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,500
the real deep structural drivers that 
causes the problem in the first place.

373
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,723
Uh,
then,

374
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,661
um,
then you know,

375
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,310
the problem can be solved relatively 
quickly.

376
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,253
Go on.
Uh,

377
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,150
um,
so,

378
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,590
you know,
I mentioned one of the,

379
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,420
one of the top solutions for me it would
be,

380
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:56,210
it would be democracy and the 
institutions of global governance.

381
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,560
So,
um,

382
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,940
and they're all sorts of proposals out 
there.

383
00:15:58,941 --> 00:15:59,774
I mean,
this is demand at that global south 

384
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,050
countries have been making for a long 
time for a fair,

385
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,933
for fair reason.

386
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,500
Cause I never hear those arguments so 
that they're afraid is that been going?

387
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,410
Can we have a bit of democracy in these 
world governance organizations?

388
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,780
And that message just never gets it

389
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,180
fair.
It never gets tired.

390
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,250
Um,
yeah.

391
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,091
So,
you know,

392
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,920
I think that there's all sorts of other 
interesting ones.

393
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,510
Like for example,
um,

394
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,810
there's a huge wage differential between
workers and the global north and workers

395
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,410
in the global south.
Um,

396
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,323
and a lot of that is due to the fact 
that multinational companies can move 

397
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,220
around the world looking for the 
cheapest possible labor.

398
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,730
The workers can't move across borders as
freely right now,

399
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,163
which is horrible.
So what that means is that workers on 

400
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:39,300
the path to try to compete with each 
other to drive their own wages down.

401
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,830
Ah,
and that's really been,

402
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,650
it's horrible

403
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,560
Gyn.
That's a horrible,

404
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,670
this Dystopian,
it is already living in this type.

405
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

406
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,630
We are in the global north luckily.
So that's something,

407
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,730
yes.
I suppose a,

408
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:55,564
although it's not totally clear to me 
that we really deserve our privileges 

409
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,584
here

410
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,863
and also we are not part of those eight 
people that have got off of everything 

411
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,660
our years,
sadly not.

412
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,780
So like as you say,
it's deep structural change like that.

413
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,280
Like when I was talking to Al Gore who 
was absolutely lovely,

414
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,760
a lot of people said talking at our golf
around fairly in my view like that.

415
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,510
My main point was how can you have 
significant change within a context that

416
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,680
is designed to prohibit real change.
And once when Yanis Varoufakis was here,

417
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,200
he said,
he said that,

418
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,530
you know that wolf gang showers at him 
democracies.

419
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay.
As long as you don't change anything.

420
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,430
So as you are now saying,
Jason,

421
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,010
systemic change is what's required now.
What are the air like?

422
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,110
So what I feel like I want this podcast 
to do is marshal people's attention into

423
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:47,550
the correct areas.
Instead of going,

424
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,200
no,
it would be nice to have some micro,

425
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,453
like your lovely students coming in on 
day one and they're big lovely scarves 

426
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,530
and their rosy cheeks or full of 
optimism.

427
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,080
Instead of that saying,
well,

428
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,580
what is it?
What ideas should we be pushing?

429
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,090
What should we be campaigning for?
Nave mentioned democracy at the level of

430
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,180
global,
uh,

431
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:08,250
of institutions that glove govern global
finance as one thing.

432
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,450
Okay.
We've remembered that.

433
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,673
What else?

434
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,670
So in order to really understand what's 
at stake here,

435
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:14,504
I think that we have to understand how a
global inequality came to be as extreme 

436
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,270
as it as it is right now.
Right?

437
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,040
So we needed like some of the historical
perspective there.

438
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,390
Okay,
I'll handle this one.

439
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,420
A lot of people are very,
very lazy.

440
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,323
Then there's countries,
European countries where we really were 

441
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:32,420
an industrious bunch and we crack shot.
I've got a lot of things done.

442
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,313
Now is there an alternative version?
So the alternative version is that we 

443
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,500
might want to start with colonialism,
right?

444
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,170
Um,
and if you want to look for sort of like

445
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,070
the origins of it,

446
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,240
of mass poverty,
it really is.

447
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,583
It really is under colonialism,
which was basically a process of mass 

448
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,270
displacement of peasants from the land 
and,

449
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,350
uh,
and a total wreckage of a,

450
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,210
of local economies.
Um,

451
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,560
so we know for a fact that during,
during the colonial period,

452
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,180
uh,
in most regions,

453
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,740
um,
income growth,

454
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,340
real income growth per capita was about 
only 0.5%

455
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,790
per year for the entire colonial period.
Uh,

456
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,660
meanwhile,
as a result of colonialism,

457
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,700
um,
rich countries like Britain,

458
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,803
uh,
got to grow at a more than three times 

459
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,384
that much.
And so that was a major driver of 

460
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:17,070
inequality.
But he,

461
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,540
but here's the interesting point.
It,

462
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,403
and if you want,
we can go back to colonials and at some 

463
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,330
point.
But,

464
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,163
um,
but in the wake of colonialism in the 

465
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,440
two decades after colonialism ended in 
19,

466
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,940
in the 1950s,
in 1960s,

467
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,430
there was a complete miracle in the 
global south.

468
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,780
Um,
you know,

469
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,703
they suddenly had a democracy and they 
had control over their own economic 

470
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,040
policies.
And what did they do?

471
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,903
They elected leftist progressive leaders
and they brought in tariff protections 

472
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:42,390
to protect their markets from a cheap 
goods from abroad.

473
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,250
They,
uh,

474
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,080
they nationalized their own resources.
They nationalized,

475
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,420
uh,
a lot of big companies and banks,

476
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,561
um,
you know,

477
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,960
the increased labor standards,
they,

478
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:51,794
they,
they redistributed land from rich land 

479
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,770
owners to peasants.
And with these policies,

480
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:59,450
they were remarkably successful.
Would you mind telling us,

481
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
I mean,
it was all over the global south,

482
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,040
but you can,
you can see it,

483
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,150
I guess most,
uh,

484
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,340
most clearly I suppose in Latin America.
I mean,

485
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:06,910
look at what's happening in,
uh,

486
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,300
in Chile and Brazil and Uruguay.
You can also see it,

487
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,560
and I'm in parts of the Middle East,
like Egypt's in East Asia,

488
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,730
this is very clear as well.
Um,

489
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,913
so

490
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,790
unshackled from colonialism found its 
way towards policies,

491
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,060
socialism,
nationalism,

492
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,983
redistribution of wealth,
management of trade and I suppose 

493
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:31,480
systems that we're focused on.
People rather than profit broad.

494
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,331
Exactly.
Yeah.

495
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,250
And they,
and they were using,

496
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,123
and they were using their,
their national wealth to invest in 

497
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,430
things like education and health care.
And so,

498
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,810
as you can imagine,
you know,

499
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,003
poverty starts diminishing and the gap 
between rich countries and poor 

500
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:45,230
countries starts closing for the first 
time in history.

501
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,730
It was really a kind of miracle.
And you think that rich countries,

502
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,840
since I always go on about wanting to 
develop poor countries,

503
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:52,870
it'll be very excited about this trends.
Right?

504
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,861
Finally,
you know,

505
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,694
there's success and poverty is reducing,
but quite the opposite actually what we 

506
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,160
see is that,
um,

507
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,453
rich nations feel that they're losing 
their access to cheap labor and cheap 

508
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,400
raw materials and the global south.
Uh,

509
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,250
and so,
you know,

510
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,084
the,
the access they'd enjoyed under 

511
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,880
colonialism and so they start 
intervening,

512
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,043
uh,
violently by deposing a lot of these 

513
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:13,660
progressive leaders,
you know.

514
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,900
So I remember reading all those about 
those leaders.

515
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,920
They're a horrible bunch.
Yeah.

516
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,170
Globalization's just colonization by 
another name.

517
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,050
Um,
yeah,

518
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,070
I suppose.
Yeah.

519
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,671
Um,
but you know,

520
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,530
what's interesting is that a,
is that,

521
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,921
you know,
the,

522
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,050
the series of coups that started 
unfolding,

523
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,500
um,
led by Britain and the US and France and

524
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,670
Belgium.
What were we doing?

525
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,504
We were funding who's very rear,
either overthrowing leaders in the 

526
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,714
global south ourselves or we were 
funding movements to overthrow them or 

527
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,734
we were just supporting right wing 
dictatorships to prevent a democratic 

528
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,460
revolutions from happening and the froth
and really love it.

529
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,900
Barry,
go get,

530
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,510
as I say,
we are in the global north,

531
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
so I suppose it,
wow,

532
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,060
that's a fascinating,
I didn't know that that's how they can,

533
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,903
a very short period of time postcolonial
Lee economic disparity was decreased 

534
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,360
because people obviously acted in a kind
of a national self interest,

535
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,540
not this sort of rampant individualism 
and inequality producing systems that we

536
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,250
have grown to know and love.

537
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,293
But these are about all of these regions
where pretty much successfully the 

538
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,930
stabilized in that that movement was 
quashed.

539
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:26,501
Right.
Well,

540
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:29,170
the other movement was quashed,
but it wasn't actually by the cous.

541
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,750
Cous cous took a really big tall,
right.

542
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,763
And the most famous of these is the coup
against Salvador Allende in Chile in 

543
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,584
1973.
And you can watch footage of it on 

544
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,260
youtube actually,
bizarrely.

545
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,550
But,
uh,

546
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,413
but so even despite these interventions,
the global south was still rising 

547
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,590
through the 70s.
Okay.

548
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,701
Um,
but then,

549
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:46,171
and,
and,

550
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:47,004
and the global north in the form of the 
g seven literally sat down around 

551
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,793
tables,
leaders of the g seven sat there aren't 

552
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,650
done round tables to figure out how to 
stop this movement.

553
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,190
The movement was called Developmental 
Wisdom,

554
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,150
uh,
and,

555
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,910
uh,
and it was very successful and,

556
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,983
uh,
and they couldn't figure out ways to 

557
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:03,874
sort of block this because it was 
becoming very powerful in the halls of 

558
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,970
the UN,
which was a democratic body,

559
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,150
global south countries.

560
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,520
We're winning a new policies that were 
fairer for them basically.

561
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,380
Um,
so,

562
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,243
but then in 1980,
the tables turned dramatically in a 

563
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:22,330
single crazy events that changed the 
global order in one fell swoop.

564
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,210
And that was the third world debt 
crisis.

565
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,343
So basically the,
the U S Federal Reserve jacked up 

566
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:29,730
interest rates,
um,

567
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,491
uh,
you know,

568
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:34,150
to really high levels,
like 20% and global south countries,

569
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,720
we're heavily indebted,
um,

570
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,320
in US dollars.
They suddenly were not able to pay their

571
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,150
debts back because of the interest rate 
hike.

572
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,550
And they slid to the brink of default 
now.

573
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,740
And if they,
if they were going to default,

574
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,030
Wall Street would have basically 
collapsed.

575
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,280
And so Wall Street talked to the u s 
government and said,

576
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,710
please,
you need to bail us out.

577
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,563
You need to solve this problem.
The US government talk to the IMF and 

578
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,124
said,
you are going to go and roll over the 

579
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:58,980
debts of those developing countries,
uh,

580
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,870
on the condition that they adopt what we
call structural adjustment programs,

581
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,390
which basically means liberalize your 
trade,

582
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,000
uh,
cut your labor rules,

583
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,670
cut your environmental regulations,
uh,

584
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,740
privatized your companies and your 
assets,

585
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
um,
uh,

586
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,853
et Cetera,
et cetera.

587
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,243
Well,
Naomi Klein's it was about in shock 

588
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:22,601
doctrine is unit that the sort of basic 
policies lead to destabilization.

589
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,224
If those regimes just one putting on a 
pick up on that Jason and see that 20% 

590
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,440
hike by the Federal Reserve,
was that part of the scheme?

591
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:31,274
How can they get that?
So that was not exactly part of the 

592
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:33,824
scheme actually that had to do with um,
with a domestic problem in the u s at 

593
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,514
the time.
So the US was suffering with what we 

594
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,850
call stagflation,
um,

595
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,000
start closure to doctor Tracy,
who's Mrs is involved,

596
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,040
will know our culture.
Well I'm embarrassed.

597
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,460
It was basically high levels of 
inflation but low levels of growth.

598
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,170
And so they had to figure out some way 
to,

599
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,303
to increase levels of growth again,
because the rich people were really 

600
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,170
upset that they weren't,
they weren't gaining,

601
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,980
uh,
you know,

602
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,150
a fair income share.

603
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,840
And so they figured out that they could,
if they raised interest rates,

604
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:08,450
it would basically cause a recession in 
the u s it would empty out the,

605
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,433
is break the back of the labor unions,
which are very powerful at time and a 

606
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,600
and decrease the price of labor which 
has succeeded in doing,

607
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,753
um,
and as a result of the cost of labor in 

608
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,610
the u s has not risen since 1980,
if you can imagine that.

609
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,863
So it was,
it was to solve a domestic political 

610
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,040
problem,
but I had these ramifications around the

611
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:25,874
world that changed the way the world 
works for ultimately for the benefit of 

612
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,710
the same interests.
No,

613
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,430
because the Wall Street said to IMF,
go roll over these lounge.

614
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,570
They said,
we'll do it.

615
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,404
As long as you adopt these systems that 
are amenable to our world view and 

616
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,714
everyone's cushy jobs or garden,
you're very good at describing these 

617
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,310
things in a way that,
uh,

618
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,350
I can understand because I understood 
that justin now good.

619
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,140
I'm angry about it.
What we're going to do.

620
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,611
Um,
yeah,

621
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:54,180
I'm hungry too.
And a lot of guys,

622
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,980
I would say most people in the world 
angry.

623
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,213
And you know,
it's interesting as the people were so 

624
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,580
angry that they took to the streets and 
masses,

625
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:05,414
right?
So this,

626
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,440
so these structural adjustment programs 
cut like caused per capita income growth

627
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:14,441
rates to collapse from a high of 3.2%,
which was really high for the south down

628
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:17,030
to 0.7%.
Basically economic crisis,

629
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,320
right?
In Africa,

630
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,590
we start incomes actually decline over a
decade or more.

631
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,424
I mean,
this,

632
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,950
this caused millions of people to be 
pushed into poverty.

633
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,680
It was a complete travesty.
Uh,

634
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,690
it was the greatest single cause of 
poverty,

635
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,680
um,
uh,

636
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,513
in the 20th century after colonialism.
So people understandably took to the 

637
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,320
streets,
um,

638
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,660
uh,
in what we called IMF riots,

639
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,573
uh,
you know,

640
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,990
but what's,
what's interesting is that,

641
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:42,824
you know,
and they complained to their 

642
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,431
governments,
they were like,

643
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:45,264
look,
you know,

644
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,580
stop these austerity policies.
Basically that's what they are.

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,811
Um,
you know,

646
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,420
we want to go back to the fair economic 
policies we had before.

647
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,563
Um,
but here's the thing is that global 

648
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,594
south countries themselves,
the governments themselves couldn't do 

649
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,970
anything about it because control of our
macro economic policymaking in,

650
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,893
uh,
in these countries had been shifted to 

651
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,040
bankers and technocrats in Washington,
in New York.

652
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,420
Right?
And so in fact,

653
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,210
structural adjustment had worked as a 
kind of bloodless coup,

654
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,760
if you will,
in one fell stroke almost.

655
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:12,594
They were able to establish effective 
control over economic policymaking 

656
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,400
processes in the global south.

657
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,653
So in a sense,
democracy at their level of a state 

658
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,584
level was irrelevant and redundant 
because the economic strings are held 

659
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,800
elsewhere.
And brought,

660
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:29,910
you just said there,
Jason,

661
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:31,950
about economics,
the economics,

662
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,210
he's not some objective sciences.
Yanis Varoufakis anywhere in there.

663
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,473
And as I'm learning from you,
it's just a model for man for 

664
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,973
maintaining inequality that all of these
systems are all trouble by certain 

665
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:45,804
people.
Some people are allowed to shift the 

666
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:47,970
rules,
change rules,

667
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,013
some people aren't.
And it's a way of continually managing 

668
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:51,580
power.

669
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,301
Yeah,
exactly.

670
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:55,530
I think that's so important to 
understand is that is that flows of,

671
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,483
of resources and wealth around the world
all have to do with the rules of the 

672
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,450
global economy and who gets to set those
rules.

673
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:02,710
Right.
So,

674
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,380
um,
in,

675
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,600
in the 1980s,
basically beginning then is when a power

676
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,130
over these rules was centralized and in 
Washington,

677
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,140
in New York,
at the World Bank and in Wall Street and

678
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:11,974
the IMF,
we've got to get rid of with them every 

679
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,961
well,
you know,

680
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,280
and what's,
I mean personally,

681
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,240
yes,
I do believe that.

682
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,103
Um,
and I don't think that's a radical 

683
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,760
position actually since,
um,

684
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,260
most people in the global south have 
made the same demands for a long time.

685
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,160
Uh,

686
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,993
why can't,
I'm sorry for asking questions that 12 

687
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:27,914
year old to ask,
why can't the like some of those 

688
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:31,520
countries in the globe which have to go 
in and pay in that stuff?

689
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:33,680
No more like these are what happened 
with Greece.

690
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,514
Is that what they did?
They went because you were just saying 

691
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,883
pain.
You mate,

692
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
why can't you do that?

693
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,683
No,
I think that's such a good question 

694
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,050
because the other option the global 
south countries had,

695
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,913
instead of submitting the structural 
adjustment would have been to just 

696
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,830
default on their loans.
Right now there's,

697
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,240
there's some problems with that.
A,

698
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,990
um,
in the 1980s,

699
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,730
uh,
somebody tried.

700
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,890
Okay.
And this is,

701
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,870
this is such an inspiring story.
Um,

702
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,700
there's a guy named Thomas Sankara.
He was the president,

703
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,520
the revolutionary president of Burkina 
Faso,

704
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,750
a west African country.
He was a young man.

705
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:02,584
He was a brilliant social reformer.
He was considered the Shag with our of 

706
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,460
Africa.
Cool mate.

707
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,380
And you can listen to his speeches 
online.

708
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,030
They're amazing.
He's really an inspiring guy.

709
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Thomas Sankara.
Thomas Sankara.

710
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,493
Yeah.
And Thomas Sankara as president of 

711
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:18,040
Burkina Faso stood up in the halls of 
the African Union.

712
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,690
Um,
in the early 1980s,

713
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,950
I went to say,
and,

714
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:21,784
uh,
and he gave his famous speech against 

715
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,484
debt.
He said,

716
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,870
um,
you know,

717
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,733
comrades,
basically debt is a form of 

718
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,410
neocolonialism.

719
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,840
It means that the west gets to control 
what happens,

720
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,883
uh,
in terms of economic policy in our 

721
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:35,020
countries.
And this is what he said.

722
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,760
He said,
here's the thing about debt.

723
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,950
Uh,
if you do not pay it,

724
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,270
nobody dies.
We surely die.

725
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,613
And it was interesting cause the room 
electrified and he basically like 

726
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:50,110
started a kind of a revolution against 
the debt,

727
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,123
right?
And three months later he was 

728
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:57,580
assassinated in a French backed coup.
So,

729
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,700
and so here's the thing is that,
is that it does it for Thomas.

730
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,440
He's a good looking guy too,
I have to say.

731
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,403
All right.
Then she's come up with a brilliant 

732
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,733
bloody revolution against that.
But when we would have a look at him in 

733
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:13,190
a minute,
oh,

734
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,950
he sounds like a bloody hero.
So a lot of these terms.

735
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:16,850
Right.
That's interesting.

736
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,730
So like,
like I like that there is a sort of a,

737
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:22,730
another way of crow barring sort of 
colonialism in to the mix.

738
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,290
When I was thinking about like,
you know,

739
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,820
these rules,
people think about these rules.

740
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,730
He's economic rules that dominate global
trade,

741
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,230
global trade and the flow of resources 
around the world as a sort of objective.

742
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,690
But they are of course determined by the
powerful.

743
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:36,524
So we should look very carefully at 
these non national transcendent global 

744
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:40,394
organizations such as the IMF and other 
things I keep thinking of of wrestling 

745
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:44,444
organizations because they are set in 
the structures that mean that change is 

746
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:48,800
impossible.

747
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,110
Another thing that just occurred to me 
is when people say like,

748
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:52,100
you know,
what's the answer?

749
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:55,010
Redistribution of wealth.
But redistribution of wealth,

750
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,873
what's been happening all along the 
wealth of the south has been 

751
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,010
redistributed,
uh,

752
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,983
north.
And of course this isn't just happening 

753
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,160
on a global level.
It's happening on the level of caste and

754
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,410
class within each of these countries 
because there's loads of people.

755
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,420
Of course you look out this window here 
in London,

756
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:09,254
Leicester Square,
and you'll see people that are in the 

757
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:11,114
globe and global norm and it ain't going
to well for their mind or they're 

758
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:15,140
sleeping out there on those streets.
Now.

759
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,190
Like I suppose really what's required is
an ideological shift.

760
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,120
That's the,
you know,

761
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,391
the,
the,

762
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,224
the self corrective measures that were 
applied in some of the countries in the 

763
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,343
70s that brought about that economic 
miracle on a national level of 

764
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:34,010
socialism,
nationalization and our protective trade

765
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:36,560
tariffs.
It's almost like at this point,

766
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,080
we need a way of,
excuse me,

767
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:39,914
presenting those kind of ideas on what 
our global level or just popularizing 

768
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:46,730
the idea so perhaps parties could run on
them.

769
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,713
Cause I saw him,
I was doing it now after what happened 

770
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,270
with [inaudible] in Greece and you know,
like,

771
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,113
and sort of what's happening in this 
country of Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie 

772
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,230
Sanders in the,
in the USA.

773
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,280
I sometimes think,
well,

774
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,890
if the,
you did have a lead like Corbyn got in,

775
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,130
would these global institutions prevent 
real change from being enacted?

776
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,900
What day?

777
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,780
Yeah.
Um,

778
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,693
well,
are you going to answer a question from 

779
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,540
this morning?
I suppose,

780
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,913
yeah,
I suppose one of the most important 

781
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:14,840
interventions,
um,

782
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,960
is to cancel the debts.
And I really mean that.

783
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:20,180
I don't mean like let's,
let's forgive some ducks,

784
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:22,610
which suggests like somehow they sins

785
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,980
raw these debts anyway.

786
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,690
Well,
so that's,

787
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,573
um,
most of them actually were accumulated 

788
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,620
during the 1970s after the oil,
after the oil crisis in 1973.

789
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,690
Um,
basically what it meant is that in order

790
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,680
to,
uh,

791
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,603
to,
to fund their own consumption in global 

792
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,340
south countries had to borrow tons of 
money because the price,

793
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,960
the price of oil was so high.
Um,

794
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,780
and so a lot of these deaths are 
actually still hanging around since 1972

795
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:46,614
some even older than that.
And because of the miracle of compound 

796
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,620
interest,
many of them have been paid,

797
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,070
paid off many times over already,
and yet they're still paying them off.

798
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,570
And so it's kind of this,
I mean,

799
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:57,830
it's,
it's a problem in two ways.

800
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,090
Uh,
it's kind of a flow.

801
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,620
It's like a flood of cash that goes from
poor countries directly to banks.

802
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,250
Mostly in rich countries.
Um,

803
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,203
and the other thing is that means that 
that governments don't have effective 

804
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,670
control over their own policymaking.
Economical.

805
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,460
So if you cancel it,
that's a,

806
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,540
in a,
in a radical way,

807
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,430
which would require of course,
um,

808
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,330
global south countries getting together 
to resist a debt to refute,

809
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,370
to collectively refused repayments.
You know,

810
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:25,100
they can't assassinate them all at the 
same time that we look bad,

811
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,703
bad,
right.

812
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,410
Then,
uh,

813
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,580
then you know,
then you free,

814
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:30,650
then countries are freed up to pursue 
policies.

815
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,120
Fellows like you don't want the nor for 
the,

816
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:35,170
you know,
canceling them.

817
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
You just want a sound guy.
We ain't paying him.

818
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,690
That is,
it's not,

819
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,580
we're not Bam,
you canceling or not,

820
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:41,560
we're canceling them.
We're just not paying it.

821
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,940
That's sort of what's required now I 
suppose what historically what the panel

822
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,050
have been,
I've been,

823
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,510
as you say,
the assassination of people that propose

824
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,553
those kinds of measures and the 
replacement with regimes that are 

825
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:55,850
friendly to the objectives if the,
the,

826
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,820
the institutions that continue to 
benefit.

827
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,163
So what was I suppose like interesting 
is whether or not new alliances can be 

828
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:05,650
made,
because I feel sort of naturally more of

829
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:06,484
an affinity with the people that would 
be canceling that rather than the debt 

830
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:09,521
is,
even though I'm,

831
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,354
you know,
here in the lovely studio in the global 

832
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,630
north and I'm doing pretty well.

833
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,373
Yeah.
And I think that that's maybe 

834
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,544
increasingly true because if you look at
the number of people who have student 

835
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:21,350
debt in the u s I mean that's a,
that's $1 trillion of student debt right

836
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,184
there.
They also realize that there was a real 

837
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,910
problem with the debt system.
Uh,

838
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,540
and if,
if you,

839
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,080
if you can start building sort of at 
least conceptual alliances across,

840
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,263
um,
across these different classes of 

841
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:35,240
debtors and I think that you can,
you can sort of free yourself to imagine

842
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,360
a world without it canceled debt.
Yeah,

843
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,410
exactly.
Where resistant.

844
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,880
Yeah.

845
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
One of the things I was thinking again 
with ankle,

846
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,870
we're just like that like with we are 
prioritizing economic systems,

847
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:47,704
which are fictions of fabrications,
certainly concepts that have been 

848
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,800
created by mankind with firing them over
actual factual material,

849
00:34:56,801 --> 00:35:01,750
physical things like the planet and 
meteorological systems.

850
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,280
And again,
with all this,

851
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,820
like with what you're saying about debt 
management and trade manipulation,

852
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,773
some countries have resources,
so like how has the country like Africa 

853
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,360
that it's mineral rich or like Latin 
America,

854
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,000
we've all of its agriculture and 
minerals,

855
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,740
how were they poor?
If you can produce those things,

856
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,650
then that's it.
You've produced those things.

857
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,703
Sure.
We clearly what's required is like on 

858
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:28,300
one level they a different way of 
looking at economics on a global basis,

859
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,283
but that's going to mean the obviously 
what that does is it challenges the 

860
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:33,784
interests of the people that are in 
control of the system as it currently 

861
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,890
stands.
So ultimately you arrive at a point,

862
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,300
don't you,
Jason,

863
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,134
where what is required?
It's not an like you've said these 

864
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,790
things out loud.
Now these ideas are out there,

865
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,280
so what do you do?
You popularize these ideas.

866
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,530
At what,
where does the rubber meet the road?

867
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:55,320
Is our American coffin say,
where does it become like,

868
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,220
well,
we're not doing this,

869
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,750
we're not doing that.
We're going to shut down this.

870
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:59,730
We're going to shut down that who is the
enemy?

871
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,220
Who Do we target?
Where do I stand or do we do?

872
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:03,961
Um,
yeah,

873
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,150
that's a good question.
I'm not sure I'm going to,

874
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,660
I guess we could brainstorm right now,
but,

875
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,530
but for me,
um,

876
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,413
you know,
the important first step is to free 

877
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:11,604
ourselves of these false narratives 
about aid and development that we have 

878
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:15,180
right now.
You know,

879
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,960
the right,
good.

880
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,690
Done.
Yeah.

881
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,910
So,
um,

882
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,990
and then,
uh,

883
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,190
and again,
you know,

884
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,113
uh,
debt cancellation I think is essential 

885
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,360
democratizing the world system.
The central,

886
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,860
I was going to mention earlier,
I was going to mention the importance of

887
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:28,710
a fairer international wage system.
So,

888
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,821
um,
you know,

889
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,654
again,
wages in the south are much lower than 

890
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,820
in the north,
if you,

891
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,310
you know,
and it's possible actually to,

892
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,830
to bring in a kind of global minimum 
wage system.

893
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,980
It would be governed by the UN through 
the International Labor Organization.

894
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,053
And you would set the minimum wage at 
50% of each country median wage and 

895
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:46,480
basically,
uh,

896
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,110
you would eradicate working poverty,
pretty much overnights.

897
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,293
Um,
and this proposal's been made by number 

898
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:52,734
of economists.
We know that there's a system in place 

899
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,200
that's capable of handling it.

900
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,360
What's the counter argument?
Why do people say you can't do that by,

901
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:01,420
that would lead to it.
What is their argument for why you can't

902
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,254
do stuff like that?

903
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,810
Oh,
I guess there are going to be that's um,

904
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,160
you know,
uh,

905
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,053
well I guess I guess proper new liberals
that say you should never regulate 

906
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,660
wages.
Um,

907
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,490
but,
but here's the way that I see it,

908
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:14,560
right?
If we're going to have a system where,

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,570
uh,
where capitalism is globalized,

910
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,733
then it only stands to reason that we 
need a system where the rules that 

911
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,810
regulate capitalism or also globalized.
So,

912
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,690
um,
I guess that's the way that I would,

913
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,910
so if you have global free movement of 
capital,

914
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,130
you need global free movement of way,
uh,

915
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,710
of workers.
If you have global capitalism,

916
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,740
you need global regulation if the way 
that people are paid.

917
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:38,260
So it's a really biased,
messed up system.

918
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,453
Tell me about like,
just having a look at some of the bogey 

919
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,330
man of the system.
Who's benefiting from this?

920
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,020
What about companies like a big billy 
Elo,

921
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,530
sue's superior,
a transnational companies like apple,

922
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:49,810
uh,
what's going on with them?

923
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,240
Haven't you got some sort of terrible 
thing to tell us about them?

924
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,620
Um,
yeah,

925
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:55,310
I mean,
I guess,

926
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,380
I guess apple is only one of many 
companies that,

927
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,273
uh,
that only really exists because they're 

928
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:00,530
able to,
uh,

929
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,570
to exploit very cheap labor and the 
global south.

930
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,460
Um,
and you know,

931
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,180
at some point I think,
um,

932
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,780
trump even said to the CEO of apple,
you know,

933
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,730
you need to bring these factories back 
home.

934
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,130
It was a trump or maybe somebody else.
And he was like,

935
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:14,570
look,
these factors are not going back home.

936
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,790
Basically.
Apple cannot come,

937
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,990
has no business model.

938
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,553
Oh.
Unless we've got little bullies mining 

939
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,550
in Africa,
like I looked at,

940
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,070
we saw we'd made a,
like a,

941
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,510
an episode of the it on a news thing.
We do.

942
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,670
And it was when it Gareth,
it was that some,

943
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,543
some just arse achingly terrible thing 
about little children are mining for 

944
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,790
this results that's in your iphone.
And he sort of watch it and think,

945
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,130
oh bloody hell.
It like you sort of unimaginable uh,

946
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:44,450
in a dry,
what do I want to say?

947
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:46,420
Sort of negligence,
cruelty,

948
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,373
irresponsibility that we don't really 
countenance when you hold an apple 

949
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:52,594
iphone or an ipad in your hand,
you don't think and you're encouraged 

950
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,870
not to think of what the consequences of
that are.

951
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,500
And for,
and like we're,

952
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,353
because I haven't,
we already been bread and inculcated to 

953
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:06,280
think as consumers,
you know,

954
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,890
I think it would be very difficult for 
me as an individual,

955
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,280
although I am willing to do it to get to
let go of,

956
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,960
you know,
this product or that product,

957
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,480
this privilege,
that privilege people continually.

958
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,580
If you're,
if you're not sort of basically homeless

959
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,414
or living in a commune people,
so why don't you give up your call and 

960
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,630
then what did you can about this then 
don't you go at that?

961
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,473
And,
and I think these things are all valid 

962
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:27,520
arguments as part of a sort of a 
mobilization of significant change.

963
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,563
But you can see that any gestural move 
from any individual is of little value 

964
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,910
unless there's a sort of targeted 
change.

965
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,953
One of the things I read once in 
adbusters that I really liked were 

966
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:40,654
saying like pick a couple of 
corporations to really target and 

967
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,220
annihilate that,
you know,

968
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,630
sort of saying like if you,
you know,

969
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:47,610
you could sort of like they,
they've,

970
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,830
they outlined how a few corporations are
hugely transgressed.

971
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,280
General Motors with their irresponsible,
you know,

972
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,363
not recalling cars that they knew were 
killing people because it works out 

973
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:57,484
economically better to leave them out 
there and pay the lawsuits or Phillip 

974
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,740
Morris knowing for years that their 
tobacco is killing people.

975
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,100
Or even what you're saying there like a,
you know,

976
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:09,150
a big friendly and attractive 
organization like Apple Look,

977
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:09,984
you know,
whose products I own and use and will 

978
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,390
use within the hour.
You know,

979
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:14,224
like,
and people will be listening to this 

980
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:16,450
podcast on those phones.
You know,

981
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,284
we are all participating in it,
but we're participating from this 

982
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,831
position.
It seems,

983
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:21,664
Jason of impotence.
And like I feel that because they are 

984
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,663
really what we ended up discussing here 
isn't narratives the way that stories 

985
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,160
are told,
but we don't think it's possible to have

986
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:37,780
significant change unless we come up 
ourselves with stories,

987
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,673
ideas,
objectives that are accessible and 

988
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,270
attractive.
Change won't happen.

989
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,900
I don't know how to sort of start,
you know,

990
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,460
getting people out on the streets,
banging a drum to bloody demetra,

991
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,180
democratize the IMF.
I don't know how to make people do that.

992
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:52,890
I,
you know,

993
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,700
like,
or interest people in that even,

994
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,940
uh,
you know,

995
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,840
here's the way that I think about it.
Um,

996
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,270
I guess I,
I guess first of all,

997
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,860
uh,
you know,

998
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,753
this idea of,
of seeing about changing our own 

999
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:04,970
personal consumption habits,
I think that is important.

1000
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:05,804
But what's much more important is that 
we organize collectively to create a 

1001
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:09,764
system in which it's not,
it's not possible in the first place 

1002
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:13,820
that apple can be exploiting workers 
like that.

1003
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,020
Right.
Um,

1004
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,243
you know,
so we need to kind of collective 

1005
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,580
solidarity before we just need personal 
responsibility.

1006
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,950
Um,
so,

1007
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:22,340
uh,

1008
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,860
do you feel collective solidarity with,
you know,

1009
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:28,010
do you feel that as a man,
do you feel if that's something that you

1010
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,263
experienced,
you're an anthropologist or an 

1011
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,124
economist,
you're teaching young people about this 

1012
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,050
stuff,
even though you're only 34 years old,

1013
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:37,370
you're like some sort of gorgeous boy 
band professor,

1014
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,400
sorry to objectify you,
but you did it to that man in Africa.

1015
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,431
So unlike,
you know,

1016
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,220
so do you feel the sense that this kind 
of solidarity,

1017
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:50,630
I'm even now watching a man who I 
imagined from Latin America emptying out

1018
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,850
garbage here at global,
uh,

1019
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:53,684
and let you know,
like,

1020
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,980
and,
and you know,

1021
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,930
this is everywhere.
This is all around us.

1022
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,940
This is us.
And you know,

1023
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,950
the,
I find it very difficult to get purchase

1024
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,800
to understand how,
what shall I do now then?

1025
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,110
And I think there is a real appetite.
I think the sort of,

1026
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:09,944
the surprising result of the last 
election for the success of Bernie 

1027
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,120
Sanders to a degree.

1028
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,210
I like all these things,
points of people's appetite for change.

1029
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,860
And like it's only the fact that stories
like,

1030
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:19,694
you know,
I grew up like when our garages for old 

1031
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:24,860
at that coup in Nicaragua and you know,
and Bloody Pinochet and all that,

1032
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:26,400
you just think that's how things are 
meant to be out.

1033
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,760
It's got to be,
I even like the struggle in Ireland,

1034
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:31,040
I sort of grew up with the view your 
spouse to have,

1035
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,140
you know,
it's like,

1036
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,790
you know,
it's very difficult to get these stories

1037
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,624
out there.
How do we emotionally engage people 

1038
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:38,714
around sort of economic arguments that 
always feel abstract cause they are 

1039
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:41,534
bloody abstract.
Unless you're a little kid mine in for 

1040
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:43,850
some minerals somewhere.

1041
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,860
Yeah.
No,

1042
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,900
I think that's absolutely right.
We need better and more powerful and can

1043
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,050
more convincing stories.
I mean,

1044
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,570
think about the power of the existing 
development narrative.

1045
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,970
So we need something that will tear that
apart,

1046
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,350
but also,
uh,

1047
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,540
you know,
create a rival to it.

1048
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,710
Right.
And the thing is,

1049
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,180
you know,
there's no question that,

1050
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,343
that,
that we are more inspiring and more 

1051
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:04,590
convincing.
And the thing is,

1052
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:05,540
you know,
I can see it in my,

1053
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,720
in my own students,
right?

1054
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,123
Like they all went to change the world.
They have these little ideas about aid 

1055
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:12,084
and microfinance.
It w as soon as you explained to them 

1056
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:15,630
how the world actually works in terms of
the global economy,

1057
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,733
uh,
and point them in the direction of real 

1058
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:20,130
structural change.
There are so excited about that.

1059
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,360
And now imagine if the millions of,
uh,

1060
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,430
of people in Britain who are part of gap
years and other like student development

1061
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:28,330
projects or NGOs,
uh,

1062
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,810
and the hundreds of billions of dollars 
that are in the industry.

1063
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,960
Imagine if that was channeled in to 
making the world fair.

1064
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,610
I mean,
it would change radically,

1065
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,473
radically and dramatically and would not
require a single drop of additional 

1066
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:39,860
foreign aid,
uh,

1067
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,700
in order to eradicate poverty and 
inequality.

1068
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,333
So it seems like it'd be nice to have 
like a little five point plan of five 

1069
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,160
things that would radically change the 
world,

1070
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:47,990
right?
You go right,

1071
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,823
here are five ideas that if these things
were implemented were radically changed 

1072
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,044
the world.
And then the next thing you'd hear is 

1073
00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:55,320
the people whose interests are currently
being served,

1074
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,303
telling you aggressively,
repeatedly why these things won't work 

1075
00:43:59,281 --> 00:44:00,091
and what,
and then,

1076
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:03,510
you know,
probably about time issue personally say

1077
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:05,260
that you're mad and you don't ever,
you know,

1078
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,810
write to express those kinds of 
opinions,

1079
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,644
all sorts of stuff that happened.
But it'll be good to distill it down to 

1080
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:12,000
five simple things.
So what are some of those ideas you were

1081
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:12,834
saying?
Massive debt cancellation or for 

1082
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,370
everybody cancel all that.
That's a really cool one.

1083
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:18,990
I'd like that.
And let's get rid of my mortgage.

1084
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,710
I'm in and like,
and like,

1085
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,200
um,
and um,

1086
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,063
what's the,
what are some of the other ones at 

1087
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,540
global minimum wage of 50% of that 
national median.

1088
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,830
Absolute.
That was a good one.

1089
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,400
Yeah.
That we're aiming for now.

1090
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:31,743
We of a few more cause it literally 
tried to organize a global revolution 

1091
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:35,220
during this podcast.

1092
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,453
Oh,
cool.

1093
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,250
So,
uh,

1094
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,173
so in the,
in the second to last chapter of my 

1095
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:40,924
book,
I actually have in fact a list of 

1096
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,860
exactly five things we can do to change 
the global economy.

1097
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,873
It's allison.
So we've already talked about a lot of 

1098
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,960
them.
We have debts,

1099
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,750
we have counseling debt,
we have the,

1100
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,010
the changing the wage system.
Um,

1101
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:52,923
we have democracy,
democratizing global governance of 

1102
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,930
economic policy.
Um,

1103
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,880
I think that there,
there are easy ways we can,

1104
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,833
we can change the international trade 
system to make it much fair to poor 

1105
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:02,950
countries as well.
So,

1106
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,460
you know,
right now,

1107
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,430
for example,
you know,

1108
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,790
right now,
uh,

1109
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,043
because of the WTO is your way around,
which came into effect in 1990 is a 

1110
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,483
global south countries are losing on 
average 700 billion US dollars in 

1111
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:20,710
potential GDP per year because of 
imbalances in the,

1112
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,360
in the WTO trading structure.

1113
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,583
So,
and that's seven times more than they 

1114
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:26,260
receive an aid,
right?

1115
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:28,760
So this is a major cause of Glen Mullen 
and 80 relevant.

1116
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,903
It is completely irrelevant.
So in the book I lay out ways that we 

1117
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:33,440
can change the trade system.
Um,

1118
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,293
and then also I think that a really 
crucial one here is thinking about 

1119
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:38,170
climate change.
Because here's the deal.

1120
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,460
We know for a fact that the vast 
majority of historical emissions,

1121
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,490
uh,
70% of them in fact have come from,

1122
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,353
uh,
from industrialized countries in the 

1123
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:48,004
West.
Okay.

1124
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,083
But the vast bulk of the consequences of
climate change are hitting the global 

1125
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:53,950
south really,
really dramatically,

1126
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,990
uh,
through wildfires,

1127
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,030
droughts,
et Cetera,

1128
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,170
et cetera.
Um,

1129
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,881
so,
and,

1130
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:03,280
and as a result of climate change,
Global South countries are losing in the

1131
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:06,850
region of $500 billion per year in terms
of losses and,

1132
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:07,390
uh,
you know,

1133
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,060
which again outstrips the aid budget by 
a factor of five there.

1134
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,193
So we needed,
we need much more rigorous action on 

1135
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:15,370
climate change to,
uh,

1136
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,480
to,
um,

1137
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,650
to get rich countries to reduce that

1138
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,943
points point to all the,
all of these proposed regulations mean 

1139
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,340
that powerful economic interests will be
curved and confronted.

1140
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,090
Can you imagine them ever like,
like sort of history sort of looks to me

1141
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:33,950
like at a glance,
and that's all I've ever given it.

1142
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,333
Like a saw a struggle between the 
powerful and the powerless with the 

1143
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:40,970
powerful conceding the bare minimum 
amount of power.

1144
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:42,380
They can concede everything.
Oh,

1145
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,790
bloody hill.
Women want the vote.

1146
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,280
All right,
we can't have slavery anymore.

1147
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,270
Oh,
right,

1148
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,891
okay.
Let me in.

1149
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:48,724
They just stopped.
But they'll go hang onto it for as long 

1150
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:53,030
as they can and then give the minimum.
And in each case you would say,

1151
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:53,571
well,
you know,

1152
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:54,404
like here we are all these years after 
suffrage and women is still exploited 

1153
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:00,740
and not paid as much as men in the 
United States.

1154
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:03,440
Look what's happening around race and 
continues to happen around race.

1155
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,453
So these things in a sense,
move slowly unless they're sort of 

1156
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:08,924
radical systemic change.
And do you think it's unlikely for 

1157
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:16,001
radical systemic change to be bought 
around without force and death?

1158
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,280
Um,
yeah.

1159
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:21,450
So,
um,

1160
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,313
I agree with you and I think that 
basically the system we have right now 

1161
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,860
is a kind of global apartheid.
Uh,

1162
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,840
and it's,
uh,

1163
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:28,674
and,
and just as the anti apartheid struggle 

1164
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:32,230
in South Africa required,
um,

1165
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,240
you know,
immense collective mobilization,

1166
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,523
uh,
I think the same as going to be true of 

1167
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:39,280
the struggle.
We need to abolish global apartheid.

1168
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,660
And,
uh,

1169
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:41,590
we'll,
it's,

1170
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,780
will it end up,
you know,

1171
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:45,010
and conflicts.
Um,

1172
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,230
it's definitely possible.
And historically when attempts have been

1173
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,750
made to make the world fair,
then that has been the case.

1174
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,760
Um,
but you know,

1175
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,141
what,
what,

1176
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:54,190
what is promising is that,
uh,

1177
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,320
is that people around the global south 
are,

1178
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,800
are increasingly conscious of how unfair
the system is to them.

1179
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,190
And they are the majority of the world.
And,

1180
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:02,900
and,
and,

1181
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,290
and the more and more that we include 
them in our,

1182
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,740
in our,
in our discussions and our,

1183
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,740
in our discourse,
through the Internet,

1184
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,060
through our media,
et cetera.

1185
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,230
Um,
you know,

1186
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:13,000
the more of this message is going to 
come through.

1187
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,123
But how do we galvanize some working 
class white bloke in dunk cost r and d 

1188
00:48:18,181 --> 00:48:18,841
day six,
you know,

1189
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:22,260
because they similarly are suffering as 
a result of this economic system.

1190
00:48:22,261 --> 00:48:24,060
But they're not going to start thinking,
oh are,

1191
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,240
you know,
identify with some bloke in Chile,

1192
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,000
you know,
how do you have a global movement?

1193
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:30,863
You know,
like this isn't just happening in the 

1194
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:32,994
global south.
Like during the time that we've been 

1195
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,760
doing this podcast,
you know,

1196
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:38,610
there's people probably minimum wage 
worker.

1197
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:42,720
Cause this is a business that I imagine 
would not take the risk of paying people

1198
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:43,554
below minimum wage,
although they'll probably outsourced to 

1199
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:47,890
a cleaning company that are using people
that have got,

1200
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,280
knows how their document it or whatever,
you know,

1201
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:54,870
to like say like this is not 
hemispherically divided.

1202
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,280
This is everywhere.

1203
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,740
Yeah.
I think that's definitely true.

1204
00:48:57,741 --> 00:49:00,320
We can definitely see elements of the 
south right here in the north.

1205
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,850
There's no question about it.
Um,

1206
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,490
and not just actually people from the 
south who are suffering,

1207
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,630
you know,
among us.

1208
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,760
But uh,
but the same dynamics,

1209
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:08,631
um,
uh,

1210
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:09,920
of the south like,
you know,

1211
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:10,754
slums and horrible health care,
health care conditions and so on are 

1212
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,330
present.
Right.

1213
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,310
You know,
in global north countries themselves.

1214
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,640
Yeah.
Cause you are an expert.

1215
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,920
If I'm picking up from the intro online,
sort of f no graphic stuff.

1216
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:22,611
Right.
And like,

1217
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:25,400
but like in La,
so all this Charlotesville Lark,

1218
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,473
it's call it last week,
you know that sort of like why you went 

1219
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:30,200
to university.
Can you imagine?

1220
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,250
Kidding me.
Crazy.

1221
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:32,031
So what do you think?
Right.

1222
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:33,950
So what do you think about that?
I mean like,

1223
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,000
you know,
like sort of for me,

1224
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:37,340
once people start parading around 
getting all Nazi,

1225
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,940
that's sort of a clear indication.
They feel hugely the disempowered.

1226
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:41,670
Like,
you know,

1227
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,503
while people will say,
Oh,

1228
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,393
you know,
under the sort of covered trump 

1229
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:46,460
administration,
people would feel it.

1230
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,294
It's more a somehow acceptable to 
express more extremist views that that 

1231
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,124
may be true.
But also those people must be feeling 

1232
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,250
something in order to do that.
You and nine know,

1233
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:03,251
and most people know that what they're 
targeting is incorrect and immoral,

1234
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,630
but what they're feeling is real.
They are feeling something.

1235
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,610
They're feeling anger,
right.

1236
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,010
How do we reach those people?
Or do we just go home?

1237
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,220
Forget it.
They're not as well,

1238
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:16,581
you know,
I mean,

1239
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,120
cause I didn't feel that way.
I feel like,

1240
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,060
oh this is,
these people need help.

1241
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,660
Yeah.
I mean,

1242
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,850
I completely agree and I'm very torn 
because on the one,

1243
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:24,511
on the one hand,
you know,

1244
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:28,610
I think that we absolutely have to fight
fascism wherever it rears its ugly head.

1245
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,833
But on the other hand,
we do have to feel a kind of compassion 

1246
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:32,460
for,
uh,

1247
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,060
for,
uh,

1248
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,000
at least,
at least for those who,

1249
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,863
who reached these conclusions because 
they feel immiserated are dispossessed 

1250
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,190
or something like that,
uh,

1251
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,930
in,
in,

1252
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,090
in a legitimate sense.
Right.

1253
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,050
Uh,
so,

1254
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,050
so to the extent that there are people 
who turn to these narratives,

1255
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,093
these white nationalists narratives 
because they feel that the system is 

1256
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:48,870
screwing them,
uh,

1257
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,990
in some real sense because the system is
very unfair.

1258
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:54,380
And let's be honest,
I think that absolutely we have to,

1259
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,330
we have to work on building their 
consciousness.

1260
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,220
Um,
to the extent that these people have not

1261
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,190
been misdirected,
but are nonetheless still racist pricks,

1262
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,470
then we can't give them any of our 
compassion.

1263
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:04,723
That's,
I guess that's kind of the way I feel 

1264
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:06,044
about that.

1265
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,120
Cause I don't let that,
you know,

1266
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,640
like I don't know why the practice is 
because I'm a white man.

1267
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,713
But like I,
I feel like when that sort of stuff 

1268
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:15,750
happens and I look at their faces with 
those torches,

1269
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,900
he's weird stuff,
man.

1270
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,160
And I feel like that we,
I feel we can't leave people behind.

1271
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,450
I'm not suggesting,
you know,

1272
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:24,284
it's obvious my allegiance lies.
We have people that aren't marching 

1273
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:27,464
around with torches.
But like I feel that unless you address 

1274
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,110
the resource rage,
the feeling,

1275
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,780
unless people like get it goes well,
who should they be angry with?

1276
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:37,700
Their unhappy.
I don't think you can get people a march

1277
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:38,534
around in the streets of the taught 
unless there's something really 

1278
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:42,050
seriously wrong,
you know,

1279
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,003
enlightened.
Unless that's addressed then this we'll 

1280
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:46,304
reformulate and re manifest the way that
is clear over the course of our 

1281
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,540
conversation,
Jason,

1282
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,613
that the exploitation that came with 
colonization route simply re presented 

1283
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,670
as globalization that behind the mask 
of,

1284
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,563
uh,
the,

1285
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,900
the previous national identity core per 
identities,

1286
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:05,210
we're able to continue the same 
exploitation,

1287
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,223
making little nods and gestures here or 
there when it became impossible to not 

1288
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,454
do that.

1289
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,413
But to make significant change,
you have to start dealing with what 

1290
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:14,954
people are feeling,
what's happening in people's hearts and 

1291
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:18,794
minds and spirits.
Cause he's really excellent to hear you 

1292
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:23,540
outline how these things have happened,
why they've happened,

1293
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,523
and what would need to change in order 
for significant redistribution or a 

1294
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,340
fairer society to a merge.
But like a tear,

1295
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,620
unless people can be emotionally 
engaged.

1296
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,543
I don't see how that will happen because
I think most people will have a vague 

1297
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:40,190
idea.
Everything is corrupt.

1298
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:40,941
Everything's,
you know,

1299
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:41,774
you can't.
But I think people also feel broadly 

1300
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,843
impotent.

1301
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,640
Um,
I think that another,

1302
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,290
another thing we have to consider here 
is that,

1303
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:49,001
you know,
the,

1304
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:53,120
the south might just take matters into 
their own hands and already,

1305
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:54,320
you know,
and I guess in a way,

1306
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:57,080
like we're kind of irrelevant to the,
to the struggle.

1307
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,900
I mean we in the West,
like we're obviously on the wrong side.

1308
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,340
So,
uh,

1309
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,353
so if you look like,
if you look at what's happening in the 

1310
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:04,790
south already,
you know,

1311
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,800
you have in Latin America you have,
um,

1312
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,160
a number of governments working together
to form kind of like,

1313
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:12,950
uh,
like alternative trade networks that's,

1314
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:13,550
um,
that are,

1315
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,980
that are based on fair principles.
And,

1316
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,600
um,
you know,

1317
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:18,434
you have,
you have the rise of alternative 

1318
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,410
alternative institutions like the,
uh,

1319
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,320
the brics bank and the Asian 
Infrastructure Development Bank that are

1320
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,154
trying,
that are to provide an alternative to 

1321
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:29,610
the International Monetary Fund and 
render these,

1322
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,030
these big global organizations 
irrelevant right now.

1323
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:33,864
We don't know if that's going to work or
if they're going to be instruments of 

1324
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:40,860
sort of sub imperial evil for the 
countries that run them like China.

1325
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,660
We don't know.
But uh,

1326
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,730
but at least that's what people are 
trying to do.

1327
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,200
And there's some hope there I think

1328
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,500
and perhaps behind these ideas.
I wonder,

1329
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,240
it's like that when you were saying this
stuff,

1330
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:51,470
like when do you think of it?
Right?

1331
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,304
You know,
how we regard the global narrative like 

1332
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,310
oh no,
this is just the way things are.

1333
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:57,230
Some countries have reached,
some countries are poor.

1334
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,450
It's because we got our got our up off 
our power,

1335
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:00,284
our season invented the spinning Jenny 
and then and then the Vdu and you know 

1336
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,453
behind sort of within this there are 
sort of concurrent narratives around 

1337
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:15,050
things like Darwinism that underwrite 
that kind of philosophy.

1338
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:15,884
Survival of the fittest.
Life is a struggle for original season 

1339
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,920
and that's just a way it is the fittest 
and the strongest and the best survive.

1340
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,090
These are already sort of selective 
narrativize patients.

1341
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,620
If history,
the mechanism,

1342
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,493
the mechanistic model of the planet,
the world is a bit like a machine 

1343
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:31,934
evolutions,
a bit like a machine selecting and 

1344
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,394
making binary choices like it's not as 
we are a underwritten by that kind of 

1345
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:39,134
philosophy then why would we be 
compassionate or why would any emergent 

1346
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:45,980
system not resort ultimately to like you
said,

1347
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:46,814
a sub imperial or comparable trend,
you know like setting up some rival 

1348
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:52,970
economic model that China's involved in.

1349
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,650
I don't know much about China but 
there's like,

1350
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,500
I don't look to me like their friends 
over there,

1351
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,280
fred in flowers for each other's air and
giving each other massages.

1352
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,880
It looks like they could be a pretty 
leery bunch as well if it all ever kicks

1353
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:07,010
off.
So unless like,

1354
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,530
you know,
where are the resources for these rules,

1355
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,110
where,
where are we going to come up with a,

1356
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,790
from where do we reach inside of 
ourselves and find a philosophy by which

1357
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:17,624
we can legitimately live and call 
ourselves human and call ourselves 

1358
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,170
brothers and sisters and custodians of 
this planet.

1359
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,323
You know,
we're what is going to be the resource 

1360
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,440
and this is the bit where I go.
It's spirituality.

1361
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,780
I think that's,
I think that's actually so important.

1362
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,010
Uh,
I think that we have,

1363
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,530
we have to start realizing that we are 
all connected,

1364
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,940
um,
that you know,

1365
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:40,774
that we're brothers and sisters.
I think that's so essential in it 

1366
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,930
sounds,
it sounds so silly to say it.

1367
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,833
That's because we've been taught to 
think it's all silly so that people can 

1368
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:47,414
crack on and exploit everyone who don't 
say that to lead to be broken and 

1369
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:51,300
sisters right now shut up.
You know,

1370
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,640
cause you're an individual.

1371
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,610
If globalization has done anything good 
for us,

1372
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,840
uh,
um,

1373
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,823
it's,
it's the globalization of our sense of 

1374
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,350
connection.
And,

1375
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,071
um,
you know,

1376
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:03,450
I think that that,
uh,

1377
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,951
you know,
we're,

1378
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:05,700
we're definitely more aware of each 
other right now.

1379
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,140
And,
um,

1380
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:07,891
I think that,
yeah,

1381
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,140
we need,
we need to realize that,

1382
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,830
uh,
in order for us to,

1383
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,770
to create a world where,
where we are,

1384
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,090
we're able to eradicate poverty,
um,

1385
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,373
we need to learn how to share.
I think that's so fundamental because 

1386
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,673
the narrative that we'd been sold from 
people in power is that the only way to 

1387
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:24,250
eradicate poverty is through GDP growth.
Right?

1388
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,930
But we know that on a limited planet,
which is what we live on a and in an era

1389
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,710
of rapid climate change,
continued GDP growth is not an option.

1390
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,723
So without,
without growing the GDP and having some 

1391
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:38,140
of it trickled down to the poorest,
how are we going to eradicate poverty?

1392
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,170
The only way to do it is to share what 
we already have more fairly.

1393
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,910
And that's gotta be a realization for 
us.

1394
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,773
None of us want to live in a world 
that's marked where 60% of the human 

1395
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,860
population isn't.
It is in poverty.

1396
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:48,830
Right?
Uh,

1397
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,320
if you talk to the average bloke on the 
street,

1398
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,960
they're not going to want that.
Uh,

1399
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,580
and so the key is,
is to realize what's necessary for us to

1400
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,760
create an alternative world.
And that really is sharing.

1401
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,983
Uh,
and that's exactly the opposite kind of 

1402
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:02,380
narrative to the one that we've been fed
all of our lives.

1403
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,293
That's right.
And it's been underwritten again by 

1404
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,560
different aspects of science and 
philosophy.

1405
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,360
Darwinism.
Is it like a survival of the fittest and

1406
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:11,670
not suggesting that evolution isn't 
real?

1407
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:12,504
Of course it is.
It's empirically and provably and 

1408
00:57:13,621 --> 00:57:14,460
demonstrable.
He will,

1409
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,270
but the implication that we should be 
competing with one another for resources

1410
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,280
is there sort of,
that's conjecture.

1411
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,740
That's just an idea at different idea 
will be,

1412
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:25,950
we should be sharing that we are here 
together,

1413
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,240
that our life is individuals is not as 
important as our life as a community.

1414
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,560
Gout,
what did you hold up a question?

1415
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:32,580
Just their mate.
What was it?

1416
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,340
And this is a question,
Jason,

1417
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:38,010
I've just thought up with using my 
brilliant little brain.

1418
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,730
Is there any hope within current global 
power structures?

1419
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:45,780
Are there any good guys,
any we can look to optimistically?

1420
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,040
Um,
don't feel obliged to say me.

1421
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:52,610
That's all.
I think there's some interesting people,

1422
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:53,444
you know,
I was talking about structural 

1423
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:56,090
adjustment earlier.
Crucially,

1424
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,953
those exact same policies that were 
imposed on the south in the 1980s are 

1425
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:02,090
now being imposed all over southern 
Europe.

1426
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,140
Right.
And Greece of course,

1427
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,340
is the,
is the,

1428
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:05,630
uh,
the key example of this.

1429
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,980
Um,
uh,

1430
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:07,814
so Greece is being structurally adjusted
for the sake of bailing out French and 

1431
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:12,710
German banks.
Basically the same thing that happens in

1432
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:16,420
the 1980s for the south and a so,
and so you have the emergence of a,

1433
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:18,440
of resistance there.
And the form is the result,

1434
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,670
or at least it was I kind of resistance 
and Yanis Varoufakis and skate.

1435
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:23,630
That dude's cool.
He's a cool guy.

1436
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:24,101
Yeah.
And I,

1437
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,990
I like what he has to say.
Um,

1438
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,650
but it's not just him.
There are also people,

1439
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,850
you know,
elsewhere in the south.

1440
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:29,684
I think that,
uh,

1441
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,750
I'm the President of Columbia,
create a gang

1442
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,960
global crusaders,
a bit like the marvel avengers franchise

1443
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,853
and I'm in it as well.
And we will go round coming up with 

1444
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:45,320
brilliant ideas and then that means of 
going into manic trances,

1445
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,990
preaching it all around the world.

1446
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,870
Yes,
I definitely want to do that.

1447
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:52,770
This whole soap speaking him Shamana 
chanting.

1448
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,040
I really liked the point you made about 
spirituality and a,

1449
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,600
and this is why,
because I feel like,

1450
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,463
look right now the,
the levels of consumption that we enjoy 

1451
00:59:01,201 --> 00:59:03,540
in the West are completely,
uh,

1452
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,630
are completely based on extraction and 
plunder in the south.

1453
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,870
They depends on the immiseration of 
people,

1454
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:10,530
uh,
in,

1455
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,010
in,
uh,

1456
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,843
in poor countries.
Now I think that that actually probably 

1457
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:17,130
plays really,
really badly for our sense of psyche and

1458
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:17,964
our inner wellbeing.
I think that none of us want to live in 

1459
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:23,660
a world like that where deep inside we 
know that every,

1460
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:24,494
the,
the things we consume in the privilege 

1461
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:26,810
that we have depends on the suffering of
other people.

1462
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,050
I think it makes us all like deeply 
anxious on some even unspoken level.

1463
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:32,390
Even if you don't acknowledge it.
And so,

1464
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,373
you know,
in order to have a kind of inner 

1465
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,240
healing,
we have to,

1466
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,163
we have to live in a world where our 
daily actions are not creating misery 

1467
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,004
and the rest of the world.

1468
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,000
That's beautiful.
We'd need to become conscious.

1469
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,620
We need to become awake.
We need to think,

1470
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:45,454
how happy is that phone making me?
How happy are these trainers making me 

1471
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:51,880
become aware?
Don't be distracted.

1472
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,570
Don't lose your connection.
Connect to who you really are.

1473
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,300
Any books you weren't going to recommend
for us.

1474
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,520
Obviously your book,
which is called the divide,

1475
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:03,940
a brief guide to global inequality and 
it solution brief a,

1476
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,930
it's very,
uh,

1477
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,760
it's basically this,
my bangs right on.

1478
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:11,380
Then it,
how many pages?

1479
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,950
Um,
it's like 340.

1480
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,200
I think that includes and notes and 
stuff.

1481
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,034
You'd have to read those bone.
I'm going to tear it out as soon as I 

1482
01:00:20,261 --> 01:00:21,910
get it,
that whole bit of the back.

1483
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:24,010
I'm not hearing it right to a copy.
I'm going to sign it for you.

1484
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,620
I'm going to try to kiss it and touch it
and cuddle it.

1485
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,540
Um,
I guess I would recommend,

1486
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,374
you know,
one of my favorite thinkers in this 

1487
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,580
field is a guy named todd.
You're in Chang,

1488
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,500
a brilliant professor,
uh,

1489
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:39,334
in Cambridge,
and he wrote an amazing book called Bad 

1490
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,300
Samaritans.
And I'd definitely recommend that people

1491
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:44,620
read that.
What's his name again?

1492
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,970
His name is hodge.
Joon Chang.

1493
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,280
Hogene Chang.
He's from South Korea.

1494
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,140
See,
I find it hard to remember.

1495
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,260
Non Christian sounding names.
What's the,

1496
01:00:53,261 --> 01:00:55,030
who is that African bloke?
Thomas.

1497
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:56,290
Well,
Thomas Sankara,

1498
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,770
Thomas Sankara.
We're looking him up and watch the South

1499
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:00,520
Korean economists

1500
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,660
fellow.
His name is,

1501
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:03,010
uh,
is how Joon Chang.

1502
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,950
Hi,
Joon Chang Thomas Sankara.

1503
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:05,963
Next week there will be a quiz.
If you don't know anything about those 

1504
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:11,280
two people,
you will be banned from downloading this

1505
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:16,281
podcast probably from itunes,
which is all part bloody problem.

1506
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,210
But we will use these tools one day to 
bring about a better world.

1507
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,100
Jason,
thanks for coming on our show.
