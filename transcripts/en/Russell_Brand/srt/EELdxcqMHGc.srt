1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
And if we can somehow extract what is 
positive from a,

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:07,760
what is called religion,
that it might,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,860
it leads us to ideas such as fraternity,
unity,

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,390
oneness,
compassion,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,463
and like,
uh,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,373
we do you not find a and connections 
between what you have learned in 

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,570
neuroscience and what you have learned 
from studying sort of Buddhism?

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,330
Oh yeah.
The connections are very direct,

9
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,164
but

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,360
how they know that stuff,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,590
but we will,
but we don't want just because it's,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
it's just the nature of consciousness is
the,

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,070
you're talking about people who spent,
especially in the Buddhist case,

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,413
a,
just an incredible amount of time 

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,240
studying from,
um,

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,780
from the first person side what 
experiences,

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
like what his character is.
The central claim of Buddhism is not 

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,660
just Buddhism but,
but Buddhism.

19
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:59,520
And I would put several of the Indian 
traditions like Advaita Vedanta in there

20
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,850
with the central claims that the,
the self is an illusion.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,200
The EGO is an illusion.
Where.

22
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:07,500
And when I say self,
I don't mean that people are illusions.

23
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,334
I mean that the sense that you have a 
subject riding around in your head 

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,023
thinking your thoughts rather than that 
there's a thinker in addition to the 

25
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,994
thoughts.
That's an illusion and that makes 

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,370
perfect sense neurologically because 
there's no.

27
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,250
There's no place in the brain for your 
ego to be sitting.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,860
There's no central place where 
everything comes together.

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,680
There's no unchanging center in the 
brain.

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,783
You're just talking about a cascade of 
neurophysiology and everything is 

31
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:36,330
distributed everywhere and it's not a 
and there are various parts of the brain

32
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,470
that are coming online and off and and 
and subserving conscious dates and not.

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,760
It's,
it's a,

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,030
it's a process and there is there.
If you could experience consciousness as

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,990
a flow of sensory and emotional and 
interoceptive experience without a.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,150
The sense that there's an unchanging 
center riding around on that flow,

37
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,300
right?
Like a man in a boat on the,

38
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,134
on the stream of consciousness.
If you could experience that 

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,760
consciousness without that,
that would be an experience that is much

40
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,540
more coincidence with what we understand
neurologically.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,593
That would be.
That would be to experience something 

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,680
that is more true from the third person 
brain based,

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,603
what do we see inside the head side,
and it just so happens you can't 

44
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,180
experience that.

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,013
That is just.
That is how that is what meditation is 

46
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,350
like when you really know how to 
meditate.

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,543
This sense that there's a meditator in 
the head strategically paying attention 

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,220
to experience rather than just pure 
experience that drops away.

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,540
Right?
So that's this one.

50
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,374
That's one piece of data in favor of,
of the of introspection here and it's 

51
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:51,444
not.
It's not a piece that the western 

52
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:57,420
intellectual tradition or the West or 
the western spiritual tradition ever got

53
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,040
a good hand handle on.
I mean,

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,893
so yes,
you can find specific Christian and 

55
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,510
Jewish and Muslim mistakes making these 
noises,

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,703
but they make the.
When they make these noises 

57
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,354
sufficiently,
they start to sound like Buddhists and 

58
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,590
they're co-religionists want to kill 
them rather often.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Religionists powerful within nation 
states in economic life,

60
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,890
people stopped believing they're not 
individuals.

61
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,300
It's very out to market at them.
