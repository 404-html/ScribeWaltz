1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,380
Ruby wax is a content writer and 
performer who has lately become known as

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:04,214
a campaigner on mental health issues and
a champion of mindfulness born in 

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,250
Illinois,
the only child of refugees.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,190
Ruby studied psychology at Berkeley.
They say it right.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,500
Barkley,
Barkley,

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,323
Barkley,
and moved to Britain in 1977 where she 

7
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:20,780
wrote for shows such as not the 9:00
news,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,330
girls on pop with doing French and 
Saunders.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,530
Saunders and Tracy Omen.
In 2012,

10
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:31,190
she completed a master's degree in 
mindfulness based cognitive therapy,

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,043
Oxford,
and in 2014 was appointed an ob for 

12
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:34,844
services to mental health.
Imagine that her recent books include 

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,443
the number one best seller,
saying new world taming the mind and a 

14
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,050
mindfulness guide for the frazzled.
Her new book,

15
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:48,440
how to be human.
The manual is released in January.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,303
She's been married since [inaudible] 98 
88 to her third husband and has three 

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,930
children.
Thanks for coming.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,010
I could have just listened to you all 
day thinking I'd like to meet that one.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,960
She sounds like a terrific human being.
Have much cute.

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,330
So Ruby,
how.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,300
What is it that made you transition from
an entertainment based life to one,

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,510
based on the psychology,
the spirit therapy,

23
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,540
whatever this is that you're doing now?
What's,

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,560
what inspired you?

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,850
Well,
I uh,

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,870
I went to Berkeley when I was young.
That's how you say it,

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,800
but Berkeley and I never finished 
because I hitchhike through Europe.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,320
I decided what were you doing in the 
first place?

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,060
I was doing psychology but I never 
finished and I just ended up hitchhiking

30
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:32,894
one day and I have nightmares to this 
day what my locker combination is 

31
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,734
because I left all my books there.
So to this day I'm still racking my 

32
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,210
brains there.
I am the illusion,

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,053
they're still there.
So I wanted to come to Europe to get 

34
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:48,050
away from my parents a and B.
I wanted,

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,830
this is pathetic.
A classical actress with no talent.

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,540
None,
Zilch.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,260
I mean since high school,
that was like 6,000

38
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,810
people in my school.
I was the only one,

39
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,160
not in the show.
6,000

40
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:02,680
were in Hello Dolly.
I settled.

41
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,570
I mean I was in production.

42
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,620
It was a full load.
Him staring at 5,999

43
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,800
people in Hello Dolly.
Anyway,

44
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,240
fuck them all.
Can you say that?

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,520
My whole life has been,
you know,

46
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,860
where are they now?
And I've tracked them.

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,010
Vengeance against Berkeley.
No,

48
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:22,844
against every township high school.
Then I went to Berkeley to study 

49
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,584
psychology and then I thought I'm going 
to come to England and become a 

50
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:33,260
classical actress if you knew how 
delusional that was.

51
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,140
So I used to watch.
Goes on top.

52
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,440
I liked it.
You were one that was much later.

53
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:40,101
I really.
Yeah.

54
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,710
Yeah.
Know Evanston was when I was 17.

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,143
Then Berkeley was 18,
19 mangoes on top girls on top of way 

56
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,150
later.
Way like a century.

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,280
Know about.
Um,

58
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,350
I was 17 girls on top.
I was.

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,290
No,
I was 30.

60
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,330
Yeah.
That was kind of a gap.

61
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,220
So you knew when you went in

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,233
early life in academia that you were 
interested in psychology then it seems 

63
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:11,191
like you pursuit some external glamorous
goal and then in Middle East Age,

64
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,263
isn't it?
You're divided between a food for the 

65
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,054
brain,
which isn't really on your agenda when 

66
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:23,090
you're 20 and yet a narcissism was 
always nagging away.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,340
I mean,
now that I know how my father got out of

68
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,174
Europe,
I understand why I have this insatiable 

69
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,360
thirst for things that are impossible,
you know,

70
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,323
because they said he'll never get out.
And now I have this drive to get things 

71
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:39,290
that people say it's impossible,
but I had no English accent.

72
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,850
I had no talent.
That's a tough one.

73
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,010
So I went to Europe.
I just hitchhiked.

74
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,790
I sort of sold some marijuana to get the
plane ticket.

75
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,803
Can I say that?

76
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,203
Yes.
None of these will be handed to the 

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,470
authorities.
Ruby Berkeley.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,590
So they had.
Anyway,

79
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,240
I sold that and some girl scout cookies.
Got to Europe.

80
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,230
I found myself an acting teacher.
Finally,

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,360
it's a longer story.
Um,

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,350
I hitchhiked with somebody from the cast
of hair.

83
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,410
This is sort of sad because that was my 
first taste of Bohemia anarchism and uh,

84
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,403
about what you feel that it is somewhat 
telling that it was a prepackaged and 

85
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:20,270
stage version of Bohemia that you are 
Lloyd yourself.

86
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,170
Well,
I was,

87
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,070
yeah,
I stopped him.

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,090
So then,
um,

89
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,223
I went with this guy through Europe and 
ended up in Israel where I found 

90
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:33,050
somebody to teach me acting.
Then I came back to London,

91
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:37,820
lived in a bedsit for two years in 
audition for probably rod is seven times

92
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,800
and was rejected each time because it 
was,

93
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,350
they said one of the most grotesque 
auditions they'd ever seen.

94
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,863
She Hunt.
I ferocious drive for success and for 

95
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:50,690
attention I read,
I'm saying new world.

96
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,780
It was a bit in there where you talked 
about being in like a like,

97
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,310
you know,
so we know we're famed,

98
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,144
sort of can lead to either it's a 
continued upward trajectory or it can 

99
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:01,574
become sort of grimly cataclysmic.
And your anecdote about that shark tank 

100
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,230
show that you,
a participant in saying that you know,

101
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,900
that there was a sort of an attractive 
woman who was in bikinis,

102
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,080
was the central focus of celebrity shark
tank or whatever.

103
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:20,081
It was a shock celebrity shark bait shop
that marked the end of my career.

104
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,690
So I like to pick that scab liked it a 
lot.

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,553
Yeah,
I'm not.

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,050
So it was always when it was already,
like Korea was

107
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,470
really fading away,
you know,

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,313
there's signs because you ride on that 
surf and people give you attention and 

109
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:33,504
you get,
you know,

110
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,770
the fantastic infantilizes you this kind
of career,

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,570
you know,
that's why you can't get,

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,673
you know,
it's so hard to wean off the mother 

113
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,590
breast of fame.
And so,

114
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,600
um,
then the car,

115
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,563
you know,
I started getting desperate and they 

116
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,870
take the nipple away and said,
oh,

117
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:49,704
I'll do anything.
Please document my gallbladder 

118
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:52,440
operation.
So they said,

119
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:53,274
here's something even worse,
getting a shark tank with Richard and 

120
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,274
grant and we'll film right?
And it marks the end of my career is 

121
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,450
peculiar,
actually receive enriched.

122
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,190
He grown up,
I would say very,

123
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,410
very talented,
bright,

124
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,573
brilliant people,
but the machinery of celebrity will 

125
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:14,351
ultimately deposit you in a shark tank.
So what was it off of them?

126
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,990
The obvious that was particularly 
revealing about that.

127
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,824
What,
what was the nature of that revelation 

128
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,540
of knowing that we were,
it's over,

129
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,170
this is it,
it's over.

130
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,220
But in the first few years of being 
ejected from the central,

131
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,360
the central spotlight is you think,
oh well this is just temporary.

132
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,590
Surely they'll have me back.
But there's telltale signs,

133
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:43,740
like when I was asked to cut the ribbon 
at Costco's for the Qa,

134
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,773
Costa coffee at terminal three,
that's another sign that things aren't 

135
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,274
going well.
So Richard and I were joking saying how 

136
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:53,180
awful this show was and really would end
our careers.

137
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,014
And then it did.
It did kind of end around then and they 

138
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,300
had a really beautiful babe from 
holyoke's,

139
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,153
you know,
who was asked to take her top off to 

140
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:05,450
practice getting into a shark tank.
So they'd say to Richard and I,

141
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,490
you aren't needed it.
Most days we weren't needed.

142
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,010
So Richard and I both bought houses in 
Cape Town,

143
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,920
which I still have because we were so 
bored in.

144
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:13,970
The rand was really bad.

145
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,803
So you could buy one for about 10 bucks.
So Richard and I went with a camera 

146
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,490
following us because they always liked 
to pretend,

147
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,990
Ooh,
this is reality.

148
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,380
We both bought houses and on day 75,
the babe with the breasts had refused to

149
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:31,010
get in with the sharks.
They had been everyday training or right

150
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,993
making or stand in a frozen freezer to 
check that she could take the cold with 

151
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,500
no top on imagine.
And she'd say,

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,040
do you think I'm being exploded to us?
We go,

153
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,240
no.
A.

154
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,180
Anyway,
the last day she refused to get into.

155
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,290
They said,
get the old ones in here.

156
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,290
Richard and I are now crammed into these
rubber things.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,740
I'm actually,
um,

158
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,400
I've actually got cystitis.
I don't know if you could say that,

159
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,930
but that's not a good thing to go into 
shark tank with.

160
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,660
So they drop us in and we're not in a 
tank and not in a cage like they usually

161
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:03,890
do for special occasion.

162
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,320
They put us in a tube,
a see through tube,

163
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,210
which means you're in the aquarium and 
the sharks watching and he's magnified.

164
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:15,140
So he comes at us.
I pissed myself.

165
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:15,974
So that urine came out of my collar and 
then Richard and I started laughing 

166
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,300
beyond and they dubbed in screams.
So it ends with,

167
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,163
it looks like Richard and I are sitting 
in the bottom of a test tube and I 

168
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,870
always say I'm the sharks just swam by 
looking for a list celebrity.

169
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,353
Anyway,
that was pretty bloody brilliant 

170
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,540
actually.
I know it does sound good now,

171
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,510
but they cut a lot out.
So it was just basically tits,

172
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,344
tits,
tits,

173
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,213
Richmond and I screaming and some urine 
coming in and coming out of her neck 

174
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,850
because credible image.
But like,

175
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:48,230
so obviously though all she told the 
story in a very humorous way,

176
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,330
it's painful.
Agonizing.

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,530
So what happened to you mentally and 
spiritually that made you want to stop?

178
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,230
Well,
you know,

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,410
I had a lot more life before and nothing
sadder than an old celebrity.

180
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,900
Nothing,
you know,

181
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,803
it used to be Panto was the pits.
Now it's one of those reality shows 

182
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,690
where you eat a cockroach.
So I thought this ain't happening,

183
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,610
you know,
and people saying,

184
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,460
weren't you?
And I go,

185
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,420
was I who,
you know,

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,470
it was never me.
Anyway.

187
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,300
So I thought jumped now jumped before 
the party.

188
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:21,360
The party's over,
you know,

189
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,763
before,
you know,

190
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,810
before you're not invited anymore.
So I,

191
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,800
I jumped right out and went to school to
get a degree in psychotherapy,

192
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,500
which was.
People let you know,

193
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,000
drop me and laughed and said,
oh,

194
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,130
it's psychotherapist,
but I just needed something.

195
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:37,080
I knew I wasn't going to be a 
psychotherapist,

196
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,570
but you got me a new group of friends.

197
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,660
I had to wean myself like coming off of 
drugs off,

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,730
you know,
getting on the tube and nobody going,

199
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,860
oh fuck,
I know who you are now.

200
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:47,850
I go,
do you know who I am?

201
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,020
And they go,
fuck no,

202
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,790
buy a ticket.
Like everybody else,

203
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,780
you know,
that one.

204
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,210
The arrogance had to be squeezed out 
like sweat.

205
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,730
And then eventually I had my new 
friends,

206
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:57,720
I went,
I studied,

207
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,351
you know,
young,

208
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:01,950
and then I'd study winnicott and then 
I'd studied bowlby and I got really,

209
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,420
you know,
I thought this is great.

210
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,663
Tell me about,
did it feel like you were picking up 

211
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,650
something that you would describe?
Brain started getting a honed again,

212
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,290
you know,
it started to come to life and then,

213
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
um,
and then I had to,

214
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,370
then I had a serious breakdown in my 
third year.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,870
That's when everything crumbled.
And I think it like before you invent,

216
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,910
reinvent yourself,
there has to be a death.

217
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,470
I always think of the Phoenix,
you know,

218
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:30,630
before he rises,
it was death,

219
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,050
you know,
that everything shuts down all your,

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,540
everything that was your reality is 
taken away.

221
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,780
There's just nothing.
And then some of us,

222
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,893
and I always love this expression,
this is where you either turned into 

223
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,440
wine or vinegar,
which coincidentally young did say.

224
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,300
So I started to,
um,

225
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,690
I've,
it was in that institution a long time.

226
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,690
Will Your institution.
Yeah.

227
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,900
And it was so bad that I.
Oh,

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,833
this is tragic.
At one point the BBC threw me another 

229
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:04,401
bone and I did a show for a.
It was a BBC Internet,

230
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,920
right?
Not like it is now.

231
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:08,754
Sex seems like a show called Ruby's room
or something that three people would 

232
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,230
hear.
It was about mental illness.

233
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,820
So,
uh,

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,380
every week,
uh,

235
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,830
three per a person would come to my 
house that was the idea with a different

236
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,320
pathology,
so I'd have schizophrenia or,

237
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,440
um,
physical dysmorphia or bipolar,

238
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,363
and then I take them in a way to have 
tea and they'd sit with my cat and my 

239
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,214
kids would come in and then I,
because I knew how to interview them 

240
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,120
because they're my people.

241
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,283
Then at the very end it would say,
here's the symptoms and here's what you 

242
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:36,924
can do about it.
Which I thought was really responsible 

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,670
and the show was sometimes hilarious by 
this time I was,

244
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,593
I couldn't get on tv,
but that was a great show even if you 

245
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:47,070
caught me out.
So again,

246
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,904
I don't want to get better because it 
was a blessing that I got kicked out 

247
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,480
now.
Um,

248
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,333
and they'd come over every week and this
is how bad it was when I first got the 

249
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,284
job,
my first guest was a depressive and I 

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,330
had 10 shows to go.
So I was in the institution.

251
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,800
Ed had to get me pick me up from the 
pick me up from the institution.

252
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,953
I've I put lipstick on.
Everybody in the institution applauded 

253
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,383
and said that was so brave.
Imagine you know that's from the cream 

254
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,374
of the crop.

255
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,453
I went home.
I'm sitting with a depressive and I'm 

256
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,303
from an institution dripping,
dripping in sweat and trying to pretend 

257
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,790
you were who you used to be and the 
depressed person is looking at me going,

258
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,500
man,
you are more fucked than I am.

259
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,530
Of course nobody can see when you're 
mentally ill.

260
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,530
So I did this shaking slightly,
but they think,

261
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,640
oh,
she's being funny.

262
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,550
Finished the interview and then was 
taken back to the institution.

263
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,043
So my first show clinically.
What type of mental illness were you 

264
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:42,964
suffering from an the Sam?
I will always have its clinical 

265
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,300
depression,
depression.

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,430
I don't get up.
It's vanilla depression.

267
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,323
It's not the up and down.
So that was a long time in there and I 

268
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,410
tried to.
I had regions.

269
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,840
They said you have to leave because 
you're not finishing.

270
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:03,841
So everything was taken and then 
gradually when I came out and that was a

271
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,601
bad time,
you know,

272
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,090
I'd sit for weeks on end in a chair.

273
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,940
Did you ever get this where you'd look 
at the shower and think,

274
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,960
oh man,
I had some day.

275
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,794
I hope I can get into that again because
it's not feasible that you could ever 

276
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,050
take a shower.
It's,

277
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,820
it's,
it's too confusing.

278
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,763
So the nurse would come and hold my hand
and then she finally take me to the 

279
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:25,294
shower after a month and then eventually
she got me to the door and then 

280
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:32,110
eventually she took me to the park and 
so I was saved.

281
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,333
So you were experiencing the,
the despair and that despair fools like 

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,310
her sort of an absence of any.
Anything,

283
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,460
live force,
any energy.

284
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,880
What have you learned about psychology 
or neurology?

285
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,240
These helpful to you in understanding 
your own personal experience with regard

286
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,300
to it's an extremist?
Yeah.

287
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,343
Well,
to study the brain is such a relief to 

288
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:05,884
understand the pathology of it because 
then you think it's not my imagination 

289
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,240
because in everybody looks is feeling 
that they're making it up.

290
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,330
Come on,
Mike.

291
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,920
Ruby.
Uh,

292
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,070
everybody thinks they're making it up.
I mean that,

293
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,933
that's that.
So the disease isn't necessarily 

294
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:22,750
depression.
It's shame.

295
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,973
That's what we all suffer from it.
It's like saying to somebody with 

296
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:27,990
Alzheimer's,
Oh,

297
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:31,520
come on,
you remember where the try harder.

298
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,540
Just think,
okay,

299
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,240
where is it now I've taken it again.
I swallowed it.

300
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,990
Go.
That is cruel.

301
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,530
So let's say to understand it,
you're neurologically.

302
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,050
Same thing as let's,
it's a brain.

303
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,100
I find it even

304
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,933
as a person that sort of personally 
knows about mental illness and knows a 

305
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,190
lot of people,
I still sort of defined mental illness,

306
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,630
annoying because the name.
Because your brain is an organ.

307
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
Do you know what I mean?
If you flipped yourself upside down,

308
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:07,490
would you call your feet mental illness?
It's a.

309
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,840
do you know what I'm saying?
Oh,

310
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,620
you look physically well.
What the fuck does it mean?

311
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,810
Mental,
mental is physical.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,100
It's an,
it's an Oregon.

313
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,750
It's the only one that when it breaks 
down,

314
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,320
you don't get any sympathy cards and yet
it runs everything.

315
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,560
So the ignorance of the world is 
astonishing.

316
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,410
Why do you imagine or what do you think 
that is?

317
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,150
Um,
there's always been a stigma,

318
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:30,751
so I'm,
you know,

319
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,240
there's always been women at 55 lose 
their jobs.

320
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,790
I'm not naive,
you know,

321
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,710
I,
I'm not one that goes,

322
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,430
it's not fair.
It was always a taboo,

323
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,970
you know,
because people may think they are by the

324
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:42,810
grace of God,
go,

325
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:43,441
I,
you know,

326
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,080
it's only a hundred years ago.
I think we were burned at the stake,

327
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,210
so it,
but it will leave,

328
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,044
you know,
the gay movement suddenly now 

329
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,140
homosexuals are everywhere in a minute.
The whole gay thing will change again.

330
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,630
It'll be,
that'll be the last taboo.

331
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,810
But where we are now is still in an era 
of shame

332
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,313
and I'm not,
you know,

333
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not too,
it's not fair.

334
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,630
That's the way it is.
If you were to examine the template of a

335
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,140
bigotry against a sort of an inverted 
comments,

336
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,660
minority social groups such as 
homosexuals,

337
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:15,494
it's because of the sort of,
the costing of the dominant class is 

338
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:22,940
shadow into those groups.
You sort of talking about James Baldwins

339
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:27,941
analysis of the category of Negro is 
because it bears the shadow of the white

340
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,503
dominant class,
so if it is in terms of attempting to 

341
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,913
follow the,
that idea that it's a maligned and 

342
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,700
outcast group and it's not something 
that's essential.

343
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,140
Because when I think about mental 
illness,

344
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:39,974
I think,
well perhaps it's because if perception 

345
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,250
itself is warped,
you can't.

346
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,910
There's nothing that you can trust.
There's nothing tangible there.

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,880
And when a human being looks the same as
they always look,

348
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,280
but they're behaving differently.
I find it very,

349
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,114
very.
I find it frightening when other people 

350
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:58,480
are in the exhibit in mental illness.
Um,

351
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,460
but from a sort of from a just because 
it's not tangible.

352
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,360
And yet,
you know,

353
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,600
my professor said,

354
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,173
I'm not bitching again,
had a bill gates put the money into 

355
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:11,450
mental health instead of malaria.
We would know what it is.

356
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,313
You would be able to define depression 
just the way you can down to find 

357
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,374
cancer.
And that's only because it had a lot of 

358
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,520
money thrown at it.
Not because it's some mystical,

359
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,280
you know,
it's serial disease.

360
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,320
It's just that nobody threw the money 
in.

361
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,460
It's as simple as that.

362
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,500
So you think no matter how seemingly a 
theorial something might be,

363
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,320
it is on some level mechanical on like 
whether it's consciousness,

364
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,770
so consciousness a,
d,

365
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,620
a,
d,

366
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,030
O w.
we're going to continue.

367
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,430
I'm going to bash us 15 minutes every 15
minutes.

368
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,470
Careful what I said about consciousness.
So the mechanics consciousness.

369
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,380
There's a whole nother ballpark,
but disease,

370
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,214
you know,
the way we can look and see how cancer 

371
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,970
is formed.
Sure it wasn't possible,

372
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,400
you know,
a thousand years ago.

373
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,440
Now it is.
Everything is.

374
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,710
It's a disease that's mechanical.
Consciousness is a whole different ball.

375
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,593
Park consciousness,
the relationship between consciousness 

376
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:13,431
and presumably the brain is integral a,
the capacity to understand the brain can

377
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,570
understand disease.
It's a,

378
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
you know,
it's a technical glitch,

379
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,173
but it can that the consciousnesses,
what the hell is that we just don't 

380
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:24,754
know,
but like,

381
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,643
but is there,
but given the perspective and 

382
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:33,291
consciousness are possibly synonymous.
Then the understanding of mental illness

383
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,460
and consciousness are,
I think integrated,

384
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,443
but that there is a relationship between
mental illness and the nature of a 

385
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:46,710
person's consciousness because it's your
consciousness that is becoming warped,

386
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:47,544
isn't it?
At least that's what's manifestly 

387
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,750
happening,
but we don't know what consciousness is.

388
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,093
Louis Wolpert says,
I'm sadnesses to depression where the 

389
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,640
tumor is to cancer.
Meaning that's.

390
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,600
God said.
It is something.

391
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,470
There's something physiologically not.
It's not.

392
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,600
It's a tumor.
That's what it is.

393
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,680
Consciousness is a much bigger ballpark.
It,

394
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,020
um,
I know what you mean is that if you have

395
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,030
a malignancy in your,
in your brain,

396
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,710
abby,
it's gonna Affect your thinking.

397
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,870
But you know,
there are people,

398
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:19,704
if you know,
I love the man who thought his wife was 

399
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:22,171
a hat.
You know,

400
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,900
all those extreme things that I think I 
even put in my book,

401
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,660
people who assumed that their arms are 
real,

402
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,300
you know,
are,

403
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,430
are the,
are their enemy.

404
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,740
And so what's that illness?
I have it written down.

405
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,140
They chopped their limbs off other 
people,

406
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,974
you know,
see their mother and they see it that 

407
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:37,524
she's a stranger or they see their left 
hand and it looks like it's trying to 

408
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,070
kill them.

409
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,903
Those are brain diseases.
They can easily be marked as to what's 

410
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:48,520
missing.
What's their consciousness is a,

411
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,810
of course it,
it,

412
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,810
it,
it,

413
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,643
um,
it inflicts itself on how the person 

414
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,564
thinks,
of course,

415
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,270
but they're still conscious.
They still,

416
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,520
the moment they wake up in the morning,
however,

417
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,920
you know,
the way we express ourselves as a teeny,

418
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:04,350
teeny grain of sand on a,
you know,

419
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,090
an iceberg,
the size of Mars.

420
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,300
So how you think and how you talk has 
nothing to do with,

421
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,343
you know,
it's a teeny bit of consciousness 

422
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,150
because consciousness is everything.
You know,

423
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,040
it's your heart rushing through its 
proteins being made.

424
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,870
It's,
we don't even know,

425
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,440
you know,
get,

426
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,390
get somebody who's in physics in here 
and I'm,

427
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm at his feet with the relationship 
between wellness,

428
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:27,714
mental wellness and mindfulness that 
you've been exploring really in all 

429
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,124
three of these books.
It seems to me that it's using tools 

430
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,920
that have been available for a long,
long time,

431
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,940
Millenia primarily through a theological
means and

432
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,301
the,
the,

433
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:54,301
these are predicated mostly on the idea 
of cleansing the consciousness,

434
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:59,800
having a relationship with an aspect of 
yourself that's not mechanical,

435
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,490
that is not the body is not the brain.
So what,

436
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,043
given that your latest book is a monk 
and a neuroscientist and you exploring 

437
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,320
mindfulness,
exploring wellbeing,

438
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,950
exploring being a human being.

439
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,070
Yeah,
it's not.

440
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,110
The monk is obviously from the mindful 
school,

441
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,260
did neuro scientist is very much,
um,

442
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,080
how,
how,

443
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,100
what addiction is,
how the future works with how evolution,

444
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,230
you know,
affected us,

445
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,073
that,
you know,

446
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,890
how we actually do evolve,
um,

447
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,100
how,
how relationships are formed.

448
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,993
He comes from the very mechanical side 
and the other one is the mind and most 

449
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:36,300
of them are married.
They completely agree on every front.

450
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,430
So that's to me really reassuring.
Also,

451
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,620
they're funny.
They have a good sense of humor.

452
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,040
Um,
but to take mindfulness,

453
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,933
mindfulness was made simple,
simple simply for the west by Jon Kabat 

454
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,460
Zinn who was dealing with people in 
pain.

455
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,180
It wasn't for any mystical experience 
and then my professor,

456
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,014
Mark Williams started to use mindfulness
for psychological reasons for people 

457
00:21:58,381 --> 00:21:59,214
with depression,
so they're using some ancient wisdom as 

458
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:06,921
young did to everybody borrows and they 
put it all in using MRI scanning,

459
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:08,670
which is only,
I don't know,

460
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,563
it's not that old and they obviously did
a lot of research and it was 

461
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:13,920
mindfulness.

462
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,710
It had the best results.
It wasn't like somebody showed up with a

463
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,544
Bindi and decided,
I'm going to push this one because you 

464
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:20,514
know there's a market in it.
They literally did experiments on the 

465
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:26,550
works and cognitive and mindfulness had 
the best results,

466
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,790
but that doesn't mean for everybody.
I mean,

467
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,440
know what's good for me is going to kill
you.

468
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,180
Do you know what I mean?
They say jogging is good.

469
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,020
Well,
the guy got,

470
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,730
the guy dropped dead.
Who'd invented it?

471
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,193
So we.
Part of mindfulness is understanding 

472
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,150
where's your tipping point,
how much you know,

473
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,830
how much is good for you,
and when does it tip into sickness?

474
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,320
When is it a habit?
When does it go into addiction?

475
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,580
When am I working in my flow and when 
have I tip and now I'm going to burn out

476
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,340
my immune system.
That's what mindfulness is good for,

477
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,500
is that you can check your internal 
temperature.

478
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,510
I can't get into the Buddhist stuff.

479
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,600
Tell us what mindfulness in your 
understanding of it and how you practice

480
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,300
it means just for people listening to 
this.

481
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,400
Well,
I don't do the woo woo stuff.

482
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,263
You know,

483
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,070
that that was not my,
what was appealing.

484
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,433
Uh,
I could give you the scientific reason 

485
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:17,540
which really turns me on how to do it,
how to do it is.

486
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,240
But I like what happens in your brain 
when you do do it,

487
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,920
because if I explained to sit up and 
said,

488
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:22,754
will you lie down?
And then you get up and then you lie 

489
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,470
down and you get up.
I've got to show you my six pack for you

490
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,281
to actually go,
oh,

491
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,050
I get it.
So if I say,

492
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:31,700
this is what you do,
you sit down.

493
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,030
I have to explain what the effects are 
in your brain.

494
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,130
So when you sit and you have a focus,
when you take your mind to focus,

495
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,010
let me just say,
should I do my spiel?

496
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,120
Usually we're in a high state anxiety.
That's the culture we've created.

497
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,730
You know,
50 years ago it wasn't so bad.

498
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,563
Now distraction is our middle name,
so that means there's a part of our 

499
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:54,734
brain that's primitive called the 
Amygdala and its aroused when we feel 

500
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,170
threatened and that's what the court is 
all out.

501
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,380
Okay?
We used it with dinosaurs or whoever the

502
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,780
enemy was.
As soon as the incident was over,

503
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,730
we got calm again.
Okay?

504
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,283
The problem is it never shuts down and 
that's why were so many people are 

505
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,190
burning out.
Kids are cutting.

506
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,550
That's the situation is that we're 
flowing cortisol the whole time.

507
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,280
That's all it is.
And it leads to every problem.

508
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:22,460
We have physical ones too,
so stop thinking mental.

509
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,140
Too Much Cortisol Burns causes cancer,
diabetes to infertility,

510
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:27,974
obesity,
all the problems are because of the 

511
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,600
cortisol.
But if you start to focus on one of your

512
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,150
senses because of the cortisol or you 
could send me,

513
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,800
those are the conditions that create 
causal,

514
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,180
like the cortisone is a,
what's happening everyone one level,

515
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,173
but like also what really needs to 
change the conditions of created 

516
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,380
conditions that creative,
but because we aren't really thinking,

517
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,400
you know,
not any more,

518
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,140
we're more at the mercy of technology.

519
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,130
Yeah.
Nobody's,

520
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,860
everyone's going,
oh,

521
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,640
let's shut technology down.
What we put it there.

522
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,430
That is our evolution.
You know,

523
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,470
we used to um,
evolve to adapt to climate.

524
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,320
Now we adapt to culture.
It is our culture,

525
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,290
but we don't have the genetic variants 
to deal with it.

526
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:10,670
So now they're having to bring in things
like mindfulness and they'll be in a few

527
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,370
years,
there'll be mental fitbit's a bet you to

528
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,204
be able to test your own cortisol 
because left to our own devices in this 

529
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,280
world,
addictions out the window,

530
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,230
you know,
I mean at its height,

531
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,850
obesity,
the whole thing.

532
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,010
I mean,
we know what the situation is,

533
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,460
but the result is you.
Gosh,

534
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,700
Cortisol.
So the thing with mindfulness,

535
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,170
when you focus on a sentence,
just go with me on this.

536
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,150
The immediately there are,
you're not thinking anymore,

537
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:35,984
you're focused on a sense.
So the Amygdala goes deactivates and 

538
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,730
this other part called the insula.

539
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,590
I'm making it simple.
Activates,

540
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,723
okay?
Each time you do an exercise where you 

541
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:49,340
watch your mind gambling,
then you focus on a sense it deactivates

542
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,170
the other one activates and the more you
do it,

543
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:52,004
just like a sit up that insulin gets 
buffed like a muscle so that when the 

544
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,110
shit hits the fan and you get really 
stressed,

545
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,680
it's easier to pull to a focus because 
you've got,

546
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,000
you know,
you've done the workout.

547
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,350
And then that,
that,

548
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,440
those voices going,
this is shit,

549
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm an asshole.
Why am I depressed?

550
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,340
Nobody else's depressed.
It's quieter.

551
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,203
What sense do you use?
I usually follow my breathing and the 

552
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,154
thing is it's portable,
so I don't have to sit on a gluten free 

553
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,270
cushion if I'm on the taxi here.
Um,

554
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:23,090
you know,
rather than see,

555
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:26,990
they've actually said that obviously 
they do scans on people mind wandering.

556
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,400
It turns out that mind wandering makes 
us really miserable and also you're,

557
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,470
you're,
you're missing three,

558
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,660
four year life.
You can't,

559
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,703
you can't.
And ordinarily a out of five thoughts 

560
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,540
for a negative.
That's just human.

561
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,860
Our proclivity as humans,
and again,

562
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,530
it was for good reason because if we 
didn't think negatively,

563
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:49,560
we would have been eating,
so we always have to be on our toes.

564
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,943
Anyway.
The thing with mindfulness is virtually 

565
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,853
you,
you get this,

566
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,680
it's a lion and not a Bush better not to
sing a Disney too,

567
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,700
because chances are you wouldn't be here
in the evolution stakes these days.

568
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,770
Yeah.
How does.

569
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,980
I can see how that works.
Anyway,

570
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,630
I'm jumping around,
but the point is,

571
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,464
is that I met.
I can lose my temper like anybody and 

572
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:12,150
rage is still my drug of choice,
but the,

573
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,020
I can get the cortisol down quicker so 
it doesn't give me the heart attack.

574
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,883
How does it work in practice?
Then thought I'll get up in the morning 

575
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,100
and to me it's a new habit like brushing
my teeth.

576
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,050
I tried to do it at home,
but all I do is track my breathing.

577
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,050
That doesn't mean there's no thoughts.
People get this wrong.

578
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,090
The only time there's no thoughts is 
when you're dead.

579
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,630
That's it.
So you watch the shit coming through.

580
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,200
You know,
the,

581
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,630
you're an idiot every but oh God,
I got and Russell brand.

582
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,370
He's such a genius.
I'm such a moron.

583
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,010
Why did I even do this?
I didn't write this show.

584
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,390
Oh my God,
I'm bluffing.

585
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:46,710
Everybody's going to get,
you know,

586
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:47,550
the usual.
Oh,

587
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,710
don't forget to get a toaster.
The toaster.

588
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,320
It has to got to be fixed and you need 
more tips.

589
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,320
Don't corn,
Russell.

590
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,430
Show get some cue tips was why wasn't I 
a ballerina?

591
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,930
What did my mother,
okay,

592
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:00,510
this could go on forever.
So they're going,

593
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,530
but because I'm used to watching them,
you know what I'm used to watching.

594
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
They're more like a radio in another 
room.

595
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,280
I sort of expect them and go,
oh yeah,

596
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:11,910
that's tracked number 42 there.
Strack number 77.

597
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,670
Of course you admire Russell.
That doesn't mean you're an idiot.

598
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,100
Just let it go.
Let it go through.

599
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,173
Yeah,
but you are still a little bit of an 

600
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,670
idiot and he's looking at you like 
you're.

601
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,690
You know what I mean?
All that.

602
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,480
So I sort of.
The minute you can watch your thoughts,

603
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,720
you're not a slave to them and some will
be true.

604
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,583
Maybe you don't like me,
but the point is I didn't waste my 

605
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,970
energy thinking about it.
If you're an asshole,

606
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,130
then I'm an asshole.
Do you know what I mean?

607
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,860
Whereas before,
and this is where the cognitive thinking

608
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:39,780
comes in,
you get caught in a habit.

609
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,613
I really thought I was the stooge that 
everybody thought I was an idiot and I 

610
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:47,700
can blame it on my parents.
You can blame it on whatever you want to

611
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,560
go on and on about it.
Life is short,

612
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,530
so instead of that,
when I get my normal records,

613
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,660
I can kind of.
If you go to a,

614
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,490
if the minute you go to a sense thinking
lowers your listen,

615
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,810
you listen,
or you could,

616
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,820
you could,
you could focus on some things.

617
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:07,590
You could use any sensory information.
You could use me re-designated attention

618
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,390
Arab's used those beads.
You know,

619
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,760
if you,
if you focus on the sense of the beats,

620
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,210
it's a very smart thing.
If you're,

621
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,603
that means that there's part of your 
body that's not involved in the 

622
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,180
thinking.
It's,

623
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,790
you know,
so of course the thinking comes through,

624
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:21,624
but you're,
you're,

625
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,610
you're laying back a little bit.
So you're going,

626
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,660
oh,
I see what I'm thinking.

627
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,960
It's not necessarily true.
Now let's rethink.

628
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,560
Maybe Russell actually likes you.
Let's just break the habit.

629
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,733
He adores me.
Now what interests me is how many of 

630
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:41,070
these men in this particular technique,
mindfulness east,

631
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,160
found in

632
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,430
theology now like I'm sort of aware like
anybody,

633
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,264
that there is much in a religion in 
scripture that is sort of of its time 

634
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:54,430
and is used to underwrite bigotry,
power and establishment.

635
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,240
But why?
Why,

636
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,073
when I become fascinated is when in 
theology there are techniques that are 

637
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,383
effective in helping us to moderate 
control our consciousness and improve 

638
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:05,944
our lives,
which they cannot possibly have had 

639
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,590
access to the which in their case can't 
have been underwritten by the technology

640
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,660
that is currently being examined with.
So I think,

641
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:20,110
how do they know in the vader's that 
this is going to work?

642
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,580
How do they know?
I don't know.

643
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,260
It's fascinating though,
Huh?

644
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,290
I know they knew that they knew,
but they were uh,

645
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,890
you know,
somebody went bingo.

646
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,270
But the thing is they've also put nuns 
in a scanner and the very fact that they

647
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:36,230
pray also lowers the Amygdala.
Amazing.

648
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,870
So I'm really 30 minutes.
There are,

649
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:40,704
you know,
there are techniques that are you 

650
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,890
feeling okay,
can I get some key tips?

651
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,940
Can Get qtip told me it'll be gone.
It'll be moisturizer.

652
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Don't you worry there'll be something to
replace.

653
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:55,614
The key tips

654
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,310
are constant morphing need in your 
consciousness.

655
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:02,130
I have this to this thing you say about 
three quarters of your time.

656
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:02,964
This is that my inability to be present,
particularly in pleasant situations 

657
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:09,600
really troubles me.
I've,

658
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,680
I am a,
I need intensity in my life.

659
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,730
You know,
I had a recent,

660
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,950
had an experience where I hung out with 
two men I didn't know well,

661
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:19,470
separate occasions on the same day,
the first part of the day.

662
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,050
Very sort of a lighthearted,
lovely occasion.

663
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,093
And I sort of thought,
why are you not fully present for this 

664
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:25,404
while you were observing this later on 
in the thousand situation was quite 

665
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,340
intense,
but I was there,

666
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,410
you know,
I felt sort of somewhat threatened,

667
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,450
not entirely safe,
but I was very,

668
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:34,284
very present.
Something in my makeup means that I pay 

669
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,640
more attention when I'm.

670
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,210
No,
no,

671
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,080
no.
See,

672
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,590
that's only because the neuroscientist 
was so hip on this stuff.

673
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,953
I would ask questions of the monk,
of the neuroscientists and this is 

674
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,714
something he,
he makes me feel better that you're not 

675
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,690
the only one if we,
um,

676
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,670
whenever we're focused on anger or you 
know,

677
00:31:57,671 --> 00:32:01,600
the negatives,
that's sort of in a way us at our best,

678
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,430
you know,
we were built for danger.

679
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,940
So with this kind of when there's 
nothing to think about,

680
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,480
we really like it were,
like you said in your book,

681
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,310
we're all addicts to something,
you know,

682
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:14,320
it's now it's a lot of thought,
you know,

683
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:16,780
I think I have to have sex.
I think I have to have q tips.

684
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,270
I think I have to.
It's just the chase.

685
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,433
The chase is much easier when there's 
something fearful or Europe against the 

686
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:24,380
wall.
It's just like a,

687
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,280
an the animal lurks within us.
So yeah,

688
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,393
it's almost like a chemical stream 
that's internally moving that we 

689
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:31,514
subsequently narrativize,
but that's why once the q tips are 

690
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:36,770
achieved,
the moisturizer will be required because

691
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:40,070
the chemical in both continuous.
What's so interesting

692
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,903
is that we feel the emotion first.
Like I'll feel to drive and they put 

693
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,260
scanners on people.
I'll feel it.

694
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,000
And then two seconds later I'll think 
it.

695
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,900
So your thoughts are the last to know in
a way.

696
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:50,734
So if you're driven,
let's say you're in the addiction of 

697
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,870
anger,
right?

698
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,730
It'll kick in,
you'll look for people,

699
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:57,470
you'll make excuses like saying,
oh yeah,

700
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:59,600
I'll give up smoking tomorrow.
Oh yeah,

701
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,650
sure.
I don't have to eat,

702
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:04,070
but I think I will eat.
Your brain will outsmart you every time,

703
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,860
but it's your insights.
They get the urge first.

704
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,813
I sort of said in the book it was like a
hive of bees and the queen is sitting 

705
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:13,520
there.
She and she suddenly wants,

706
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,330
let's say a starbucks.
She thinks because she wants it.

707
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,164
You're going to get a starbucks,
but there's a zillion worker bees in 

708
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:21,140
slave bees in valet parking fees.

709
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,213
They're already buzzing with each other 
and whoever buzzes the loudest has made 

710
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,800
the decision to get the latte.
Then the queen things.

711
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,270
Oh yeah.
That's what I wanted.

712
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,373
There's been a vote in every cell in 
your body and before you actually kick 

713
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:34,934
into something and we're.
And the juice of anger and rage is so 

714
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:40,860
much more addictive.
Nobody ever gets addicted to Kale.

715
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,693
I'm really trying to create that.
Don't you won't drinking stuff five a 

716
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,290
gallon,
still don't like it.

717
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,730
No.
I once I thought,

718
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:50,390
you know,
I,

719
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,470
oh,
juice is good for you.

720
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:55,910
So I made a big thing of it and I went 
on the train and drank it the next day I

721
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:56,744
spent my day vomiting and they,
then I figured out I had drunk the 

722
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,060
equivalent of four football because it's
also his stuff for football fields.

723
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,160
I had food in my body

724
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,420
drinking because of the stuff rubin's 
don't.

725
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,470
So this,
um,

726
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,340
so the understanding consciousness from 
a mechanical perspective,

727
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,423
the mind,
the mind or people in academia so 

728
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:25,621
particular about the meeting,
like my point is these are,

729
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,820
if you have a mechanical understanding 
as expressed through that analogy around

730
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,860
the hive mind and aspects of it,
you know,

731
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:33,694
the sort of the essential self being the
queen bee and different aspects of the 

732
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:37,690
mind being different,
you know,

733
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,530
different bees within it.
But what

734
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,260
these are the consciousness and we only 
know about the queen.

735
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
So when you say consciousness,
we have no idea

736
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,210
except of course many of the,
uh,

737
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,093
tech,
the techniques that I am interested in 

738
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:55,790
which incidentally are sourced from the 
same place as mindfulness.

739
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,530
Just another aspect of it.
They say that we can attune ourselves to

740
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:05,531
an aspect of consciousness that is free,
is truly witnessing all else.

741
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,210
And I will.
Well,

742
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,480
how could it be because you are 
remembering so you know,

743
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,443
you,
but what my experience of my experience 

744
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:17,540
of meditation is that it's only 
retrospectively that go,

745
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,291
oh yeah.
Wow.

746
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,124
I wasn't in that moment.
I will just then that's already 

747
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,304
happened.
I wasn't thinking and cataloging what 

748
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:27,560
went on for one minute or a second or 
for five minutes,

749
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:28,394
who knows,
because my understanding of time it has 

750
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:32,580
been removed.
Subsequently I narrativize it and go,

751
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:33,710
oh,
that was what was happening.

752
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,280
So I'm having a different relationship 
with in those moments.

753
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,030
I'm not thinking,
uh,

754
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,053
you know,
I want to have sex or I'm not good 

755
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,780
enough,
or this might,

756
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,610
I'm afraid of this or a desire that 
there is a cessation in that.

757
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,773
So that's it for me.
That's another aspect of meditation 

758
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:51,834
that's important,
which I think can change our 

759
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,520
relationship in a more,
uh,

760
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,763
a more total way or a more extreme way 
than just using it as a technique to 

761
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,890
calm down,
which I think is bloody valuable.

762
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,410
It is.
And you're completely right.

763
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,660
I get very excited about the mechanic 
that,

764
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,070
but that's my problem.
You know,

765
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:08,910
the uncle say,
oh,

766
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:09,850
get off it.
Come on.

767
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:10,684
It is,
it is a practice of spirituality and I 

768
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:16,080
have an allergy to that,
but why?

769
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,550
Because I,
you know,

770
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,384
I grew up at the time where I was 
rebirthed and then somebody shoved a 

771
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,150
crystal up my ass and then,
you know,

772
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,250
religious persecution drove your family 
from.

773
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,810
That might be it.
Yeah.

774
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,644
I didn't even think of that.
So if I can't see it or I can't smell 

775
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:31,770
it,
I don't buy it.

776
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,700
But of course the point of mindfulness 
is a.

777
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,760
and I have a hard time saying it to 
develop.

778
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,203
I always call it the c word compassion,
which now I talk about in the book and 

779
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,920
presence.
Those are also the point of it.

780
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,963
But you see my proclivities always go to
the daddy won't think I'm smarter than 

781
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,171
less.
I know the,

782
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,700
you know,
the physiology of it.

783
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,560
Daddy will think it's another cookie 
stuff,

784
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,390
which Oh,
I've just had a revelation.

785
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,980
We must kill,
must die killing us.

786
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,740
I didn't realize you did.
This is like 8,000

787
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:05,574
years of shrinkage you just did is the 
reasons probably I'm holding on to the 

788
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:11,850
sciences because my dad said everything 
I did was cool stuff.

789
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,860
There's not just that though,
Ruby.

790
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:14,694
This is all our father.
Patriarchy itself is built on 

791
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:18,414
materialism and mechanistic thinking 
precisely because it can be commodified 

792
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,034
and sold and as soon as we begin to 
access aspects of consciousness or self 

793
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,720
that are beyond mechanistic and 
materialistic thinking,

794
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,440
we begin to dive,
dive voltage,

795
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,363
understand access realms where our role 
here is no longer the role of the 

796
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:42,030
consumer,
the civilian,

797
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:43,980
the citizen,
but something quite different.

798
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,700
And the thing that fascinates me about 
your work,

799
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,563
I,
I think that what I think you're doing 

800
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:50,514
beautifully and what cannot be disputed 
as you're making it accessible to a p 

801
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,220
and people need like,
like you.

802
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:57,054
People need to understand it in terms of
material and mechanics and patriarchy 

803
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,790
and if that gets people to understand 
it,

804
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:03,660
that's brilliant,
but what,

805
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,703
but what I am fascinated by is how will 
people accessing this information 

806
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:11,040
without any of these tools.

807
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,903
And what else is there?
Because I think you're monk friend is 

808
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:14,634
right.
It is about compassionate is about 

809
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,404
presence.
People have been talking about it for 

810
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:17,994
Millennia.
Knowing that our salvation is in that 

811
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:20,484
direction and the father.
I don't think he's solely and uniquely 

812
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:23,574
external,
but the father like you have just 

813
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,310
expressed,
we carry with us.

814
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,293
It becomes all of our father,
both inner and outer and it prevents us 

815
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:33,720
from exploring neurological circuitry 
which might give us,

816
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:34,050
you know,
uh,

817
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,240
say new world to your time back at you.
You should write a book.

818
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:37,690
Well,
I'm,

819
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,750
I've got a pen.
I've made the first tentative steps into

820
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,810
the chest.
That's a brilliant thing.

821
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,750
And I just had an epiphany about my dad.
Go on that.

822
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,420
You're still trying to press.
I can't.

823
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,860
I can only do one pip otherwise now come
on very.

824
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,930
There are series of exactly what goes 
wrong.

825
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,290
Michael Epiphany's is they can do a 
moment dialogue.

826
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,713
He gave me multiple,
multiple epiphany's barely even moved 

827
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:05,710
off the chair and the epiphany's carrier
on the train.

828
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,903
She could never walk again.
We're making sport at this rate while 

829
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,910
she's.
The woman is permanently.

830
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,971
Um,
so,

831
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:17,740
right.
So you think that there is an obvious.

832
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,663
Obviously there is an aspect of your own
psychology even in your sort of 

833
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,200
enlightened,
modern.

834
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,430
You're right that the,
the,

835
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,160
the,
the father and all of us motivated me to

836
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:30,520
seek,
but it means it's a very thin slice.

837
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:32,170
You know,
the mechanics are the thin slice.

838
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,590
The bigger consciousness is the real 
mccoy.

839
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,960
I obviously it wisdom.
It's Buddhism.

840
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,590
That's the real mccoy.
I find it difficult to talk about,

841
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:46,591
even though I studied it at Oxford,
but these guys opened consciousness.

842
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,330
You're right,
they didn't define it because it doesn't

843
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,164
have,
you know,

844
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,260
I think Einstein said,
if we're not conscious,

845
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:54,790
how do we define consciousness?

846
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,860
You know,
they didn't define it,

847
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,790
but they experienced it.
These guys open up where it's timeless,

848
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,200
you know,
these are the 10,000

849
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:03,610
hour guys.
It's timeless.

850
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,080
There is no,
um,

851
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,213
you know,
they do tests on these monks the whole 

852
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,531
time,
you know,

853
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,640
doing the,
uh,

854
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:13,770
there's a blink test where most of our 
Amygdala with sound,

855
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,613
you know,
because they show really disturbing 

856
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,810
pictures.
But these guys,

857
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,240
their Amygdala,
it's more complicated than that.

858
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,030
But they're not.
Their Cortisol doesn't rush language,

859
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,360
you know?
So it worked.

860
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,200
It happened to be that it could have 
been people who were astrologists.

861
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:32,950
It could've been a scientologist,
it happened to be Buddhism.

862
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:35,650
Would you say that it happened to be,
but they would say no.

863
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,633
We have this technology passed down from
the Buddha who had to stop saying it as 

864
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:40,840
a Westerner.
You know what I'm saying?

865
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:43,030
They knew who the WHO,
you know,

866
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,350
with our arrogance,
we think,

867
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:46,150
well,
the fact that I was sitting there,

868
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:46,984
what was he doing it meanwhile they knew
everything and so what fascinates me is 

869
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,890
what else I know and what else they 
would teach us if we follow this down.

870
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,873
He's not going to just.
Why do you think I live with a monk 

871
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,270
through your different modes?
Well,

872
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,620
he lives in my house but.
But his job is,

873
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:04,000
he works for Google and he works for 
facebook and he works for banks and they

874
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,920
all long to learn this piece,
you know?

875
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,380
And how do is this guy,
by the way,

876
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:09,550
this monk 10,
he,

877
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,650
he's,
he's the guy at the monk in the book.

878
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,270
I'm using your gas now.
He doesn't know we let the monkey.

879
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,350
I shifted monkey.
And is that bad?

880
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,011
Well,
yes.

881
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,830
I think it is popped a monk in the spare
room.

882
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,210
The kids left.
Right.

883
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,230
And that there was this room and I 
thought that is so such a great move.

884
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,390
But I met him.
He was doing a conference and he.

885
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,224
Boy,
can he,

886
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,300
he's articulate.
You went to Oxford because he western?

887
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,530
Yeah,
his mother.

888
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,543
I know this is weird.
You remember the Kumaras not mirror the 

889
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,160
other lady,
she's his son.

890
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,211
He said,
sure.

891
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,950
He's the son.
So He's,

892
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,770
he's,
his story is unbelievable.

893
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,480
And uh,
he went,

894
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:51,314
he was an addict and he went to clean up
many years ago at Sammy link and they 

895
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:56,810
give a,
they,

896
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,490
they give a course,
you know,

897
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:00,400
for a year to clean up your act.
And he,

898
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,653
he got so into it.
He became the fully ordained monk and 

899
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,990
I'm talking five years of silence.
It's,

900
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,270
they don't just pass this card out and I
have to say his vibe in my house.

901
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,200
I called it my air freshener in or the 
toilet duct,

902
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,210
you know what I mean?
You can't get a better vibe.

903
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,010
Do you meditate with them?
Yes we do.

904
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,331
Yeah.
Well,

905
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:21,164
he travels the world,
he's in Jamaica and now with Google I 

906
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:25,980
think because in tech stuff or doing 
meditation,

907
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,280
they all long to do,
you know,

908
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:30,830
to learn meditation for different 
companies.

909
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,760
They pay him and he,
the monk isn't allowed to have money,

910
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,900
so he's building retreats.
So he's just built one in.

911
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:39,734
Um,
I think Southampton and then he's 

912
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,240
building another one in Scotland.
They're not allowed to make money.

913
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,820
So he's making the extreme ends of the 
country.

914
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,833
He's coming around the coastline 
building retreats and he's not allowed 

915
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,590
to have money.
It's curious,

916
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,710
isn't it?
The retreats for white people to kind of

917
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,130
go and get it,
get a massage.

918
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:55,821
This is for,
you know,

919
00:42:55,821 --> 00:43:00,821
Buddhist nuns and things.
It also trade critiques are matching the

920
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,093
retreats and retreats have that thing.
You go to a hotel and there's a candle 

921
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:07,160
in a stone.
So they go,

922
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,033
oh yes or no.
And now this appropriation of spiritual 

923
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:13,964
doctrine and the commodification of it 
is something that I am kind of aware of 

924
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,393
and it's peculiar when sort of great 
tech monoliths such as Google and 

925
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:27,560
facebook recognize its efficacy and 
essentially say,

926
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,420
how can we commodify this?

927
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:34,220
How can we utilize this for profit?
How can we turn the light?

928
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,083
Because you said that you know that your
experience has been that it's increased 

929
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:41,150
your compassion and it's increased your 
presence.

930
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,040
Now you may find yourself in a situation
where I presume you still have the drive

931
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,180
that your wife had because it's part of 
my DNA.

932
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,253
So what do you,
what you're doing with it and let me 

933
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:55,310
know you're doing this,
but how is it working for you with this?

934
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,750
How is your ego?
How is your sort of self laceration,

935
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:02,270
self flagellation,
how's that all going now?

936
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,670
Well,
it's got the same tone.

937
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:06,140
You know,
we don't change skin.

938
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,551
It's,
you know,

939
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,950
I can feel the same qualities,
but as I said,

940
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,170
it's,
I can't think of anything better.

941
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,440
And Jon Kabat Zinn said it.
It's more like a radio in another room.

942
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,220
Like I can grab it and be Ruby again and
part of me so addictive,

943
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,180
you know,
if you show me,

944
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,283
I don't know,
Jon Kabat Zinn gave me a really good 

945
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,360
review it last night for the book,
the sides,

946
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,200
you and he's my.
That's my.

947
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,093
He invented mindfulness.
So my next thing was to write John and 

948
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,160
say,
do you think I could come over

949
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,540
and do my show for you?
I mean,

950
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:37,380
he's just the ambition.
I can feel it.

951
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:37,791
You know,
it's,

952
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,570
it's an,
it's like an animal.

953
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,400
It's,
it's the,

954
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,880
you know,
when I see the alien and I go,

955
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:43,770
hey buddy,
I know exactly how you feel,

956
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:49,170
but it's not wild ambition that I,
that made my career with no talent.

957
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,393
I would not have developed talent,
but it in the beginning I wouldn't take 

958
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:57,060
no for an answer.
I just showed a bunch of me.

959
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,470
They said,
but you can't ever TV show.

960
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,760
I said,
I'm showing up.

961
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm here.
Turn on the cameras.

962
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,881
They said,
well,

963
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:03,960
who the hell are you?
I said,

964
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,100
I'm here.
I've arrived.

965
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,053
What about,
so do you think this is something that 

966
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:07,794
can be for really interesting?
You said something interesting and I 

967
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,304
went off.

968
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:12,803
I'm happy with tangent.
Do you think whereas it could be 

969
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:15,354
described and diagnosed neurologically 
or do you think there's another 

970
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:20,820
component to that?
This drive,

971
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,670
this willingness,
this ongoing desire?

972
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,020
Well,
it's dopamine.

973
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:28,590
It's the same thing that gets people 
fixed and fixed on approval,

974
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,950
fixed on rage,
fixed on,

975
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,730
you know,
I now from doing.

976
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:33,760
Who Do you think you are?
I,

977
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,653
I get it.
My dad got out of their country two 

978
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,640
seconds before he would've been 
annihilated,

979
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,550
but he never shut it off.
When he got to Chicago,

980
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:44,070
he ate his way through.
He lived in rage.

981
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:47,970
He became the tyrant he escaped from and
that's how I lived.

982
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,280
I will eat you alive if you get in my 
way and now it's just,

983
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,630
it almost destroyed my family,
whatever,

984
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,553
you know,
because I wasn't around when my kids 

985
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,040
were young and now because of,
of watching the mind what?

986
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,240
Just watching it and going,
okay Ruby,

987
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,330
but without whipping myself because you 
know if you hit the animal,

988
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:07,920
it gets more violent.
I go,

989
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:09,420
calm down,
calm down,

990
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,700
let's use that anger when we need it.

991
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,070
This isn't perfect.
This is my ideal.

992
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,620
Cool.
And then when you know when,

993
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,010
when the man hasn't come to fix your 
fridge and it's been a year,

994
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,080
use that anger.
Well Ruby,

995
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,243
go on the phone and do what you do,
but then when you put the phone down 

996
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,753
then don't go call somebody up and go,
you know what I did because that son of 

997
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:32,040
a bitch didn't show up and I do some of 
this off on it.

998
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,183
Get off and then I've got it on and then
I started picking other things to make 

999
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:38,220
me angry because I want more just like a
junkie.

1000
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,743
So kind of understanding that I will 
give somebody hell and it's so tempting 

1001
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:45,420
because it does taste more delicious 
than being nice.

1002
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,650
Wba said,
every artist

1003
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,690
you must create his own religion and you
are creating your own religion.

1004
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:54,674
Sourced as it necessarily seems to be in
your case from a secular understanding 

1005
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,100
of modern scientific ideas and it is 
working for you.

1006
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:04,943
You're telling us some of your code,
some of your methods for coping with 

1007
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:09,644
your personal human condition.
So now you're saying that some of that 

1008
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:13,304
source material,
the drive is being repurposed 

1009
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,230
effectively and have your relationships.
For example,

1010
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:21,200
if your husband and your three children 
are they,

1011
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,730
those relationships are improving

1012
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,970
but they are improving.
But then my kids are.

1013
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,250
My two daughters are in comedy now and 
the engine starting to were,

1014
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,133
you know,
of me and I'm becoming Ethel mermen to 

1015
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,280
push them and they go back off and I 
feel too,

1016
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,610
but eventually I do have to back off 
because it's your kids.

1017
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:43,120
I can't devour them the way my dad 
devoured me this time.

1018
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm backing off.
He ate me alive and you know,

1019
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,060
he died and we were not friends.
What do you mean you live?

1020
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,260
He just,
uh,

1021
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,630
he overwhelmed me,
you know,

1022
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,390
they,
it to mold me like a piece of clay.

1023
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,750
They wanted a rep,
they wanted a photocopy and I wasn't it.

1024
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,030
So they kicked the shit out of me.
He meant to be.

1025
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,220
I was meant to be.
I do know,

1026
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:05,320
you know,
like my mother was perfect.

1027
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,760
She spoke eight languages.

1028
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,980
She married a tyrant.
Really bad move.

1029
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,013
A just a nice Jewish person,
I guess not interesting for them to get 

1030
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:16,510
something outside of a d because I was 
uh,

1031
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,980
I,
I got really,

1032
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:18,923
I didn't get any grades.
They were below the toilet because I 

1033
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,710
was.
Now I know I was traumatized.

1034
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,270
I couldn't think they'd say,
what books did you read it?

1035
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,180
And I go,
um,

1036
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,353
I couldn't.
So I was putting the remedial class and 

1037
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,340
my brain was frozen and I thought it was
because I was dumb.

1038
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,890
There were traumatized by your father.
They were wild.

1039
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,650
I wrote a book way earlier called,
how do you want me?

1040
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,023
Yeah,
how do you want me?

1041
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,020
And Carrie Fisher edited it and she said
my parents were as crazy as hers.

1042
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,740
There's nothing else to say because hers
are the a list.

1043
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,600
And my parents were as dark as it comes,
as dark as it comes

1044
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,450
by that you like.
And this isn't to be diminishing,

1045
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:56,284
you mean sort of ordinary domestic 
darkness as in there's not talking 

1046
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:00,480
sexual abuse and violence.

1047
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,960
Really a lot to do with say,
oh,

1048
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:05,470
but there's violence and there's fear 
and there's psychological torture.

1049
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,430
Go on.
No,

1050
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:06,970
no.
Psych.

1051
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,250
I mean add is a nice man who I'm 
married.

1052
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:10,084
He said when he sees my parents,
he wants to take their head and Jeremy 

1053
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,343
Chapman,
the side of a table because of the 

1054
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:17,134
cruelty

1055
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,423
and the Philip Larkin talk.
Why they're responding to a sort of 

1056
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,730
massive social trauma and political 
power.

1057
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,540
No,
I didn't know where they came from.

1058
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,640
They didn't tell me about the Holocaust.
It was never mentioned.

1059
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,900
So they passed it to me.
So I had noises of.

1060
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,053
I never watched a film about Nazis 
because since I was a kid I heard 

1061
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:37,824
screaming in my head and that's because 
they gently sublimated it and past that 

1062
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:42,264
noise.

1063
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,440
You think that the law,
I mean that's not genetic.

1064
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,274
Is it?
That sort of some sort of manual 

1065
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,410
psychological transference.
Then I put my hands up,

1066
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:53,820
I don't know.
Torture,

1067
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:54,743
curious.
Mystery remains at the beginning of 

1068
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,300
psychoanalysis as separate from 
neurology.

1069
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:04,140
There's these sort of distinct schools,
Freud who it's too pricey,

1070
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:04,974
dreadfully believing the psyche is built
upon repression and primarily repressed 

1071
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:12,640
sexuality and young who maintained that 
there was that,

1072
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,483
there was a mystery and a,
a collective unconscious and a 

1073
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:23,810
transcendent aspect to who we are in 
sales on the button to.

1074
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,430
I'm into that dude.
So what?

1075
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,383
So what,
so you love young so that because for 

1076
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:28,580
me,
a lot of it,

1077
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,850
like in there like I love this Melville 
quote,

1078
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:36,800
I hear a lot of all human sciences but 
passing fables,

1079
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,110
meaning that if you'll look at and go,
oh,

1080
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:40,370
how cute.
Quantum theory,

1081
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,293
you know,
like,

1082
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,510
so like w,
w,

1083
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,353
w what in the work of young you find 
fascinating from your perspective of 

1084
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,700
someone who understands numerology and 
the.

1085
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,993
No,
but let me say the answer to everything 

1086
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,020
isn't mechanics.
It's just I hold onto it.

1087
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,110
That's my problem.
I see.

1088
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,310
Yeah,
it's not cool.

1089
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,230
It's not that reductionist,
but it's me showing off,

1090
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,380
you know,
for.

1091
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,850
I really liked meditation because it 
makes me much prettier.

1092
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,893
And um,
and I sit and I sit in front of my 

1093
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,160
Buddha and I liked,
you really liked me then,

1094
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:13,050
but I think,
hey,

1095
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,670
throw that Amygdala.
It's like me tossing my dick out.

1096
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,140
Very nice ticket.
Walsall smothered in Amygdala

1097
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,770
by law.
So what do you like about you?

1098
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,290
You're like,
they're sort of archetype

1099
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,103
the shadow.
The shadow is so interested in chorus 

1100
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,370
because,
you know,

1101
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,170
Freud wanted to be a neurologist but you
couldn't find a live brain,

1102
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,970
you know,
so he was guessing there is no Edd,

1103
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,380
there is no metaphors and similes,
metaphors.

1104
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:43,620
And he was kind of spot on too.
But he went to literal.

1105
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,460
Whereas there is something that isn't 
mechanical,

1106
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,160
that isn't neuroscience of something 
that we're,

1107
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,710
that lives below as something looks.
I,

1108
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,380
maybe it's my addiction,
maybe it's the rage,

1109
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,020
but it's something that when the mind 
does meet it,

1110
00:51:58,021 --> 00:52:01,320
the light shines on the darkness.
There is a kind of piece.

1111
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,950
And that is mindfulness too.
It's the dark meeting,

1112
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:05,960
the light,
you know,

1113
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,930
it's the,
it's the,

1114
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,450
it's the anima and the animus.
There's a marriage.

1115
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,890
And so resident fighting yourself with 
those abusive thoughts,

1116
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,950
which I accept because if you get angry 
at those thoughts,

1117
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,610
this is a more mundane quote,
but if you run from the monster,

1118
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:23,130
it chases you and if you face it,
it runs from you.

1119
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,190
So there's a marriage and he was very 
much about,

1120
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,260
you know,
the male and the female side,

1121
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,200
the dark and the light.
And that's as far as I can take it.

1122
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,880
He was right on the button.
I mean,

1123
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:35,610
if that's not stealing from Buddhism.
And he was into Mondalez.

1124
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,250
And of course archetypes is completely 
correct.

1125
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,970
We aren't one thing.
I'm not just ruby who's like at this age

1126
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:44,070
and I don't feel female.
I really don't.

1127
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:46,110
If you woke me up at four in the morning
and said,

1128
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,033
what sex are you?
I'd really have to say I don't know 

1129
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,093
because I don't feel it.
And we should understand we're not a 

1130
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:55,020
stereotype.
This body is a,

1131
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,350
is always a cesspool of genes and 
experience.

1132
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,470
And I could pull a card at any time,
you know,

1133
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,980
I'm living proof.
I was a moron at it as a kid.

1134
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:05,814
And then ended up in Oxford,
who the fuck would have thought that 

1135
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:08,574
one?
It's just if you let it go and you 

1136
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:12,750
really study because it ain't coming to 
you.

1137
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,220
That brain has got its neuroplastic.
You can really develop this brain.

1138
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,080
It's going to be harder when you're 
older.

1139
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,560
But if I start learning Chinese and I 
start,

1140
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:22,394
you know,
whatever I will have the wiring that a 

1141
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:26,010
30 year old doesn't have,
I suspect,

1142
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,843
but a lot of people listening to this 
will suffer from mental health issues 

1143
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,350
because you know,
I attract them and obviously you do.

1144
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,273
Yeah,
my people.

1145
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,760
So people can change.
They can change.

1146
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:39,060
But let me just say with the disease,
you know,

1147
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,680
again,
we don't know about this.

1148
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,260
If you have cancer,
you can't think your way out of it.

1149
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,100
Do you understand that mental illness?
Well,

1150
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,490
you don't get the fear.
You can lower the fear.

1151
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:52,530
You can with depression,
you lower the shame.

1152
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,460
Which means that when I feel the little 
nips of the depression coming,

1153
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,533
I.
because I have a little bit of an 

1154
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:00,090
overview,
I know what to do.

1155
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,880
I don't get busier,
which is usually my way to go.

1156
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,770
I'm perfectly fine.
I'll show up at your,

1157
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,950
I'll say showed a bit of charity for 
safe.

1158
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:08,784
The puffin,
like I give a shit last time and I took 

1159
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,484
up scuba diving at Christmas under 
brightened pair to show everybody else 

1160
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,810
and then you end up in an institution 
for five months or take on a lot of work

1161
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,883
to get the cortisone,
which is the very thing that's making 

1162
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:23,820
the depression about depression,
about.

1163
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,840
So this time I see it coming.
I shut everything down because I respect

1164
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:30,720
that disease.
I checked into a little retreat,

1165
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,220
no TV and I just sat and bit the bullet.
It hurts like fuck,

1166
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,900
but it passed faster because the court 
is always down and that's why Kabat Zinn

1167
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,740
worked with people in pain.
Focus on the pain because if you don't,

1168
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,730
your whole body is the essence of pain.
Focus in on where it is.

1169
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,620
Okay.
I'm not completely depressed,

1170
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:50,454
but there is depression,
so that doesn't mean I still take 

1171
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:55,650
medication,
but I have a different relationship with

1172
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:56,450
it.
Gosh,

1173
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,680
that's really fascinating and really,
really helpful.

1174
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,723
And what I'm enjoying very much about 
this conversation is the evident 

1175
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,760
marriage between spirituality and 
science.

1176
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,613
Uh,
I feel that this is going to play an 

1177
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,140
important part in our conversation.
I mean,

1178
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:13,974
you and I,
but I mean culturally going forward 

1179
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:20,160
because my senses and it's one of the 
things we've been looking at continually

1180
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:22,140
over the course of these podcasts.

1181
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:22,700
But,
uh,

1182
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,670
you know,
Adam Curtis,

1183
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,380
it was that said,
oh my God,

1184
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:28,290
the old thing is dead and the new thing 
has not yet been born.

1185
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,040
And like we're the age of managerial 
politics,

1186
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:35,220
this age of bogus,
institutionalized religion,

1187
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,203
all these things coming to a halt and 
people are looking for ways to connect 

1188
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,440
with their essence.
Ways to understand their story.

1189
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,860
But it's got to have the right language.
It's got a feel real.

1190
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,530
People can't pose through it.
But I sent that.

1191
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:50,364
There's much in this stuff,
but we've talked about are around union 

1192
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,653
archetypes are mostly because we need a 
way to access the mystery and the 

1193
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,520
mystery.
I don't mean a woo woo thing.

1194
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,503
I mean,
there is a terrain that can never be 

1195
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,460
contained by our limited capacity for 
knowledge.

1196
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:09,560
That's why,
I mean I,

1197
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,453
I might be pulling this out.
We weren't going in this direction is 

1198
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,700
this all comes down to it are,
are working to as a tribe.

1199
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,013
It all went wrong when we,
when we suddenly went agricultural and 

1200
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:22,883
we lost each other and I think in this 
world we're too isolated and I have 

1201
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:27,454
these.
I have these things called frazzled 

1202
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:31,340
cafes were groups of people.
Well,

1203
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,580
I didn't mean to swerve.
I just good.

1204
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:37,030
I always the real cure.
The real thing for compassion,

1205
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,193
this is the road is,
is that we start to be human again with 

1206
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:41,980
each other.
You know,

1207
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:42,814
meeting it's smaller groups maybe and 
not doing cocktail bullshit where you 

1208
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:46,840
have to say,
how's your kid?

1209
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:48,670
Like I give a shit.
You know,

1210
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,680
life is hard enough when you talk to 
people.

1211
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:53,590
It's completely superficial.
So anyway,

1212
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:57,010
from my experience in the theater,
I set up these groups.

1213
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,950
If you go to Fresno Cafe Dot Org,
put down your name,

1214
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,610
we get in touch with you marks and 
Spencer's gave me all their cafes.

1215
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,443
They shut it down and then groups of 15 
meet every two weeks with a facilitator 

1216
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,780
and all these people,
it breaks your heart.

1217
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,330
It's so touching.
They're scared in the beginning,

1218
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:15,550
like little frail humans and they're all
ages,

1219
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,930
all colors,
all you know.

1220
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:22,140
And suddenly they start to speak human 
to say they're not mentally ill.

1221
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,590
They're like all of us,
you know,

1222
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:27,430
they opened their hearts and by the time
you leave they're all holding hands.

1223
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:29,280
They've exchanged phone numbers and 
they've.

1224
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,363
Some groups have been going for a year.
They have their tried and I know that 

1225
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,710
that's part of all this is that we're so
alone and nobody's comparing notes.

1226
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,450
I didn't like that idea.
I think you're quite right about like.

1227
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,363
So you found out Harare.
Come on and just talk to us through the 

1228
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:48,984
sort of.
One of the driving ideas in his book 

1229
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,290
sapiens is how the advent of 
agriculture,

1230
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:57,400
which is obviously an economically lead 
notion meant a huge.

1231
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,423
I'm not the expert mentors,
so if people urbanizing coming together 

1232
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,630
and people becoming sort of units in an 
economy,

1233
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:09,040
as opposed,
I'm losing a certain necessary essential

1234
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:14,041
connection that lucky he explained to 
you that book agricultural works for one

1235
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,650
Straw society,
but it doesn't work for the majority.

1236
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,910
Now bumped it up,
bumped it up,

1237
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,744
bumping up and technology works for so 
many things just like they needed to go 

1238
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:28,260
into the architectural stage.
But we are.

1239
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,183
Our brain is still caveman.
We don't know how to adjust to this 

1240
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:33,260
population,
but this technical,

1241
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:33,720
this,
uh,

1242
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,553
this notion of theological,
continued progress is underwritten by 

1243
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:43,120
the same idea as agriculture.
We are progressing,

1244
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:43,954
we are going forward.
And I would say that that requires a 

1245
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:51,961
mechanistic and materialistic Veltin to 
continue and to you say,

1246
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,441
no,
no,

1247
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:54,670
no.
There is a mystery.

1248
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:55,683
All the things that we access through 
the senses on by Necessity Limited and 

1249
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:02,680
unless we find a route back to who we 
are,

1250
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,543
who we are as humans,
I've wished something is like I have in 

1251
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,464
my own life,
a collective eyes to support groups and 

1252
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:15,160
community groups where we do talk to one
another and very open,

1253
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:16,180
honest plane.

1254
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,010
Why are you lucky?
Yeah.

1255
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:21,680
It's like the gift of a of addiction in 
my case,

1256
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,633
but I think you know,
but there's nothing to stop us creating 

1257
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:28,140
societies based on a different model.
Creating groups on a different model of,

1258
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,103
well,
we need an only commune on the economic 

1259
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,134
circumstances.
Certainly struck me recently how 

1260
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,820
ridiculous the kids socializing shopping
malls,

1261
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,400
that's where they go.
If you're not spending money,

1262
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:44,060
you're not congregate in,
you're not coming together so we can ran

1263
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:44,894
sack and attack religious institutions 
or we like and God knows how corrupt 

1264
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:49,214
they became,
but it was a place where people went 

1265
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:53,630
together to do something other than buy 
something exactly when.

1266
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,920
It's the same thing if,
when we had churches in a gathering,

1267
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,203
again,
we didn't need extraneous methods or a 

1268
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:06,881
mental fitbit.
That was a community was being human.

1269
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,680
It's a group that's human,
not an individual.

1270
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,450
An individual alone is like a finger.
So,

1271
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:13,284
um,
it's the loneliness and know the being 

1272
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,270
open to saying,
I'm fucked.

1273
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,193
I don't.
I need to be contacting people and 

1274
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:20,834
saying,
here's what's going on in my mind is 

1275
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:22,844
that what's going on in yours?
And there will be such relief when that 

1276
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,054
happens.
What do you think of this thing that 

1277
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,270
Yanis Varoufakis said when they were in 
their egos?

1278
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:33,320
The individually we exist in like he's 
sort of a person that don't really,

1279
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:35,780
like he said that he thinks matter came 
before spirit.

1280
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:39,690
So I disagreed with him.
Talking about consciousness must've come

1281
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,690
from matter rather than Matt coming from
consciousness,

1282
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,240
but he said that you,
that we exist in dialectic,

1283
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,800
that we exist in relationship to travel,
you know,

1284
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,490
what is self if there aren't other 
people to relate to.

1285
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:53,660
So our whole notion of what it is to be 
an individual is wrong.

1286
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,100
So what do you,
what in your work long.

1287
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:56,934
I mean they,
you know,

1288
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,033
the mother builds the child's brain 
through her reaction that a kid is just 

1289
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:06,320
a blob of fat unless the mother starts,
which was my case,

1290
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,110
um,
she tries to keep me up and then dressed

1291
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:10,953
me and gave me these hideous haircuts 
and I was sent to school as a blob of 

1292
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:14,900
fat.
Yeah.

1293
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:18,140
So,
but the only way a human being is molded

1294
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,890
is through the compassion and the 
emotion of the mother.

1295
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,350
She teaches the kid what it is to be 
human.

1296
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,270
So we,
I love this expression,

1297
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:29,660
we work like neuro Wifi.
If I was in a rural state,

1298
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:32,660
I pass it straight to you.
So we infect each other,

1299
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:35,870
but we could infect each other.
Maybe with things like mindfulness,

1300
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,720
I can only teach you compassion and give
you compassion.

1301
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,120
Now I can't do it alone,
but if my,

1302
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,880
if the certain and there are chemicals 
involved,

1303
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:47,160
then oxytocin switches on chemicals,
chemicals very.

1304
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,980
I like a nice bit of Mumbo jumbo of a 
morning on a good road,

1305
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,040
but a good ball when you get that sexy 
thing.

1306
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,050
That's the chemical.
I'm sorry to say.

1307
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:57,884
There is no consciousness involved.
Something goes a little bit of juice 

1308
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:03,360
goes to the penile area.
I'm not talking about sex rule,

1309
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:04,194
but you did that all in your own mind.
I love Mumbo jumbo means a rhubarb 

1310
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,730
Halabaloo no,
no monkey business.

1311
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,930
I meant the monkey business.
No,

1312
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:13,843
but I'm saying compassion is could be 
reduced to a chemical and we do talk 

1313
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,120
about in relationships like

1314
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,383
why chemicals,
where do they come from and what holds 

1315
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,710
them together.
What invisible grid.

1316
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,610
Let's see.
I'm not as smart as you.

1317
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,440
That's the problem.
A mess.

1318
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:35,160
Finally we agree on my pencil in 
egotistical.

1319
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:38,130
I'm indulgence.
How you going to really be?

1320
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:39,330
Um,
what I'm going to say.

1321
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,160
I like that thing you were just ending 
on about that.

1322
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,730
We find it difficult to individually 
rate because like when something happens

1323
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:45,564
around me and my parents,
but I can't see it objectively because 

1324
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,900
they are immeshed in the self that is 
witnessing it.

1325
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,973
So thank you very much for that.
You've got go because literally there 

1326
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:56,910
I'm wrapping this up,
not because I want to,

1327
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:57,744
but because it's my train produces.
It says you've got to get train in 25 

1328
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:02,064
minutes to go to east bumfuck.
I can't imagine why I'm spreading the 

1329
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:06,110
joy.
Well,

1330
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,190
they need doing these shows.

1331
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,360
I love it.
That's fantastic.

1332
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:12,180
I love the show is the show that I came 
and saw.

1333
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:16,550
To me it's a meeting of mind and ego.
The perfect marriage.

1334
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,290
Yeah.
Who comes first?

1335
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,550
Um,
ruby is,

1336
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:23,580
I'm usually the ego.
Surely selfish the mind,

1337
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:25,200
but then mind is sort of all 
encompassing.

1338
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,520
Ruby,
thank you for coming on here.

1339
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:28,920
Thank you for your letter.
You plug your book properly.

1340
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,510
Uh,
Rubin's new book,

1341
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:31,344
how to be human.
The manual is released in January and 

1342
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:33,744
there's a very good,
at least one good quality on the front 

1343
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:36,174
of it.
Get you can preorder it now on Amazon 

1344
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:43,200
because preorders is good for people,
so right now a ruby.

1345
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,034
Thank you for coming to talk to you.
Thank you for giving us some time to 

1346
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,810
look good.
You're beautiful inside cameras.

1347
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,680
I.
Oh,

1348
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,370
Oh,
I didn't.

1349
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,203
Fuck.
I didn't hold my stomach or you'll be 

1350
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,170
beautifully unselfconscious.

1351
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,340
Ruby.
Thank you very much.

1352
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,450
Thank you.
Thanks.

1353
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,823
