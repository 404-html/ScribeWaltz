1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,570
But it was when I picked up the course 
in miracles,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,290
which doesn't claim to be for everybody.
But if the two of you,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,133
you know it,
what I got from the course in miracles 

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,430
and I was in my mid twenties at the 
time.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,980
I'm not saying that this had not been 
another things that I read,

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:20,010
but for whatever reason I didn't get it 
from other things I had read.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,510
And that's that there is no coming to 
God except to the person in front of you

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,000
that that is,
you know,

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,570
the course of miracles says belief in 
God is doesn't mean anything.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,433
It's the experience of God and the 
experience of God is our love for each 

11
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,350
other.
I love how in the course it says,

12
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,610
some people conspire with God who do not
yet believe in him.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,130
It's like you and I were talking before 
about atheism and so forth.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,940
So,
yeah,

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,860
I learned that the loving other people,
everything is secondary.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,220
And my capacity to reach across the wall
that separates me from others through my

17
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,620
own judgment,
to my own attack thoughts,

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,163
uh,
to my own failure to take 

19
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,660
responsibility,
self righteousness or whatever that work

20
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,620
on myself is the spiritual work.
Ah,

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,853
pay yourself so that you are able to 
feel God or love or whatever where it's 

22
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,580
convenient in your relationships with 
other people.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,563
This is,

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,800
that'd is the experience at the cod.
Oh,

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,823
tell us more.
While the course in miracles says there 

26
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:23,000
is no getting to heaven,
um,

27
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:23,834
this says heaven is entered two by two.
You cannot get there unless you take 

28
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,044
someone with you.
And Heaven is not a condition or a 

29
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,540
place,
but an awareness of our oneness.

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,900
So the course is not trying to get us to
believe in God.

31
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,030
It's trying to get us to believe in each
other.

32
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,810
If you're in front of me,
you're my spiritual lesson and you're my

33
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,644
path to God.
The courses everyone you meet will 

34
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,464
either be your crucified or your savior 
depending on what you choose to be to 

35
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,104
them.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,480
Uh,
on my own,

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,433
like just literally on my mom to moment 
feel like a lot of my life was somehow 

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,790
this ossification of loneliness,
of dreadful solitude,

39
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,030
pain of loneliness.
I revisit it somehow often when alone,

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,010
even briefly,
intermittently like,

41
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:10,760
uh,
you know,

42
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,290
I arrive here,
it's late,

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,120
I go to the room and I feel sort of 
headachy and post flighty and alone.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,460
And I have to remember that when I 
talked to other people,

45
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:21,980
if I prepare myself in the manner in 
which you have described,

46
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:26,981
I will feel God and loving other people 
even in just incidental communication.

47
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,990
Like when I talked to her personal,
excuse me,

48
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:32,690
do you know if there's any yoga here and
the person really takes,

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,010
oh yeah.
Let me try and find it.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,821
I think,
oh yeah.

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,180
People are beautiful sometimes on my own
I get pretty scared.

52
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,530
Like,
you know,

53
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:39,951
like,
oh,

54
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,784
I'm going to be attacked or people won't
be beautiful or the world won't take 

55
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,180
care of me.
Have you over time,

56
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,140
been able to come cultivate a sense of 
this,

57
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:55,141
a faith in God through relationships 
that will be sustainable even in periods

58
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,890
of solitude,
suffering,

59
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,120
pain,
an insurance.

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,153
Yes.

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
How did that happen?
And when I have been these times of 

62
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,950
pain,
I wonder when was the time of wilderness

63
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,900
for you or the garden?
I wrote a book called tears to triumph,

64
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,734
which is exactly about that,
about the application of spiritual 

65
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:19,390
principles to human despair.
One of the issues that has been very,

66
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,343
um,
that I've been very passionate about is 

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,350
talking about they sociopathic economics
and how,

68
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,783
um,
even human pain will be turned into a 

69
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,550
profit center if there's money to be 
made for some corporation.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,880
Um,
I'm very concerned about what I think of

71
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,714
as the psychotherapeutic 
psychopharmacological industrial 

72
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,400
complex,
which has chosen,

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,373
uh,
for the sake of $1 billion industry to 

74
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:50,590
medicalize human despair.
And the truth of the matter is,

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,060
um,
depression.

76
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,894
And I'm not talking about bipolar or,
or schizophrenia that's outside my lane 

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,110
outside of my purview.
But the normal spectrum of human despair

78
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,010
is my lane.

79
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,360
Because the real spiritual path does not
just take a yellow smiley face like this

80
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,770
and put it over everything.
I'll be happy,

81
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,604
be happy.
Buddha would not have begun his path of 

82
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,834
enlightenment.
And until he crossed his father's walls 

83
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,464
and saw suffering for the first time,
Moses was sent by God to the Israelites 

84
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:25,771
because they were suffering in,
in Egypt as slaves and Jesus suffered on

85
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:30,430
the cross.
So the real spiritual outlook recognizes

86
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,383
the suffering of the human condition 
when we are living outside the context 

87
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,990
of our love for each other.
So that,

88
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,711
you know,
if you,

89
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,420
if you had a heartbreak,
uh,

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,710
uh,
divorce,

91
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,840
financial failure,
bankruptcy,

92
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,420
lost someone you love,
these things are painful,

93
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:50,260
but they're not mental illnesses and 
what us,

94
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,290
and that's why in that book I write,
this is what Buddhism says.

95
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,050
This is what the Old Testament says is 
what the New Testament says.

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,320
Aa or anything else you,
you,

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,010
that's why you keep coming back.
Because it's a rough day to day.

98
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,910
It's recognize it's a rough day to day.
It's recognized.

99
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,920
It's a rough day to day.
And if you're left on your own,

100
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,410
God knows what your mind might lead you 
to do.

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,580
So when you know principals,
whatever your path is,

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,560
um,
and you practice them.

103
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,410
So you asked about myself.
Um,

104
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,680
okay.
Marianne.

105
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,630
Um,
and I've,

106
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,480
I've lived two periods of time that by 
any,

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,690
by any means today would be called 
clinical depression.

108
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:31,390
But even that's such a scam.
All that means that somebody in a clinic

109
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,730
set it.
There is no blood test,

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,890
right?
But if you've been there,

111
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,724
you,
you know it.

112
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,190
Okay?
Marianne,

113
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,190
you number one,
you don't even think this is going to be

114
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,610
done quickly.
So none of this like just,

115
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,720
you know,
today people say,

116
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,830
well,
your mother died a month ago.

117
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,540
Aren't you over it yet?
No.

118
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
Okay.
It's gonna take time.

119
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,754
Number two,
who are the safe people who can 

120
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,900
accompany you on this?
Who are the people who will bear witness

121
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,734
to your agony during this time?
What are the things that you're gonna 

122
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,594
need to support you?
Make sure you have a lot of a bubble 

123
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,340
bath.
Uh,

124
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,770
make sure that you stay with your 
meditation even though you don't want to

125
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,480
stay with your prayer work.
Uh,

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,790
make sure you show up for other people.
You will be,

127
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,580
you will have a tendency to isolate 
during this period of time.

128
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,310
You must not do that.
You must get up and work.

129
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,144
Your subconscious will put aside your 
despair while you're showing up for 

130
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,880
other people.
And then when you come back from that,

131
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,970
you'll go back to crying again.
There was an art to navigating despair.

132
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,173
There is an art to navigating depression
and the spiritual spiritual principles 

133
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,210
lead us there.
There are seasons of life.

134
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,670
I quote in that book from Roca where he 
says,

135
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:41,810
let me not squander the hour of my pain.
