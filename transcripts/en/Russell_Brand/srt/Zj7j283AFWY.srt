surviving abuse and relationships,
has seen her become a familiar face on 

5
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,224

She spent 17 years working with people 

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,140
in crisis in some of the toughest,
the states,

Manchester.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,060
Emma can eat welcomed onto the skin.
Thanks for coming on.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,060
Thank you for having me.
Oh,

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,410
well,
that's.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,860
I suppose to understand your background 
a little bit,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,150
so could you tell us a little bit about 
the therapeutic work you do?

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
I guess that my background begins when 
as an adolescent I was sent to the 

16
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,000
psychological system,
so I was a regular truant.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,030
They have problems at school and when I 
kind of went and saw a psychologist,

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,210
what I found was I just couldn't engage.

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,043
I didn't feel like they listened in a 
way that progressed me and I kind of 

20
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,790
remember thinking at the time,
why can't adults speak to young people?

21
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,624
In a way that respects the fact that 
they are intelligent and know who they 

22
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:25,230
are to some degree,
so I kind of thought and ruminated on it

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,700
and even though I had problems at 
school,

24
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,534
I decided that was the direction I 
wanted to go in to actually be able to 

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
transmit my own experiences into some 
way of understanding of the young 

26
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:36,270
people.
So that's what got me into therapy.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,530
I did a psychology degree initially and 
then moved into therapeutic context,

28
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,364
so studying more client centered didn't 
necessarily fit me because I'm quite a 

29
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,584
challenging person.
I like to use challenge in therapy what 

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,773
it means and so your a therapist,
but it sort of conventionally inferior 

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,743
p,
the therapist is what managers listen 

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,710
and you stick your in there and go,
yeah,

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,950
I mean that's the type.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
One of the things that I've tended to do
is to feel that even though there are 

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,033
therapists that are challenging,
but certainly client centered isn't so 

36
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,054
egan and Roger's aren't necessarily egan
and Rogers or just to have the kind of 

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,613
God so client centered therapy.
But I think purism is an interesting 

38
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,244
area.
Full stop because I kind of really 

39
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,644
struggled with it and I was training and
I was really lucky at Manchester 

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,393
University that they kind of allowed me 
a bit of a freedom to express my own 

41
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,574
beliefs in what I thought I wanted 
therapy to be and I kind of argued that 

42
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,180
I couldn't ever be either of those types
because I'm not that person.

43
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,720
And even when you watch therapists and 
action who claimed to be pure,

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,033
often you'll see they're not.
They're doing something kind of 

45
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,404
different.
So I learned in the long run the best 

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,600
thing I could be in therapy with me,
just me,

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,733
so that I felt that my presence and 
conversation and experience with the 

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,690
client's journey that really authentic 
and that's what's effectively worked for

49
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,380
me.

50
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,380
You think that part of the role of 
therapy is to discover a kind of truth,

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,083
a truth of the client's experience.
Is that so do you think it's necessary 

52
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,784
for you to be authentic in that?
Absolutely believe that authenticity is 

53
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,494
key.
Full Stop.

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,600
I think that we talk about authenticity 
as if it's quite easy to achieve.

55
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,434
Just be yourself is a classic example of
things that people say to you when 

56
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,700
you're growing,
go up and when you're an adult,

57
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,020
just be yourself,
but actually being yourself takes a huge

58
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:35,020
amount of courage,
a huge amount of self discovery,

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,873
a willingness to be wrong,
a willingness to learn all the time and 

60
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,784
it's quite scary.
So I would say that I try to be as 

61
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,534
authentic as I can be all the time.
I'm sure at times I get scared and that 

62
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,054
makes me wear a mask or I'm convinced 
that somebody needs me to be or 

63
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,524
authority,
so I'll put one of those and I have to 

64
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,534
work against it,
but I think that's human nature to some 

65
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,164
degree.

66
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,320
Went at Stanford,
that was in there a couple of weeks ago.

67
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,190
He's like an explorer survivor.
Yeah,

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,940
I know.
He's like a bit like bear grylls.

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,540
I think he's the grunge bear grylls.
That's how I see him.

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,783
It's like a shelf stripped back bear 
grylls who said that when he spends 

71
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,820
prolonged periods of time on his own,
the uh,

72
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,743
what do you know that that is the 
aloneness itself is more challenging 

73
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,674
than the survival aspects of what he's 
doing because he said that when you're 

74
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,323
in relationship with another person,
you're constantly refining yourself and 

75
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,610
adjusting.
And he very interesting.

76
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,170
They used these guys like even now as 
I'm looking at you and I'm seeing if you

77
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:38,890
approve of one sign and was really sort 
of quite fascinating.

78
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,083
So when you're talking about when it's 
talking about like having an experience 

79
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:50,230
of an authentic self,
it must be a difficult thing for anybody

80
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,370
to achieve because we responding to such
a lot of stimulation.

81
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,350
So sort of stimuli.
Absolutely.

82
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,184
I mean everybody seeks approval.
Everybody to some degree wishes to be 

83
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,964
liked.
But at the same time I think my journey 

84
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,743
began when I started to feel like it was
actually me wanting to police the world 

85
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:12,550
and get liked by everybody that was 
possibly making me exhausted.

86
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:15,460
And I wasn't really reflecting on what I
needed.

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,713
And there was almost like a desire to 
just accept that it isn't selfish to 

88
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,230
concentrate on the self,
it's self full,

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,393
and to actually strip back what I 
thought people wanted to know about me 

90
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:32,401
and wanted me to be like,
and to just be myself and to some degree

91
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,770
in my therapy,
I think that's what works.

92
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,880
That I don't feel that firstly I need to
be judged by my clients.

93
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,970
And conversely I don't judge my clients 
either.

94
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,193
The,
when we experienced that thick 

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,600
conversation that kind of occurs as a 
thickness in therapy,

96
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,890
I know that people.

97
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,723
Who Do you mean by that thickness?
I think practitioners who may be 

98
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,354
listening to this or get it and probably
people the falling in love or having 

99
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,190
really,
really intense relationships.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,353
It's almost like there's a northern 
context to the relationship and other 

101
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,810
feeling in the room like this.
Something bigger,

102
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,060
wider,
more cerebral,

103
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,880
but almost touchable.
Even though it's not that.

104
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,223
It's like a sense of knowing that this 
is where we're meant to be in that 

105
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,544
moment and just feeling completely 
connected and almost like within a 

106
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,434
bubble of something good.
I'm not saying it isn't with pain or 

107
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,110
that there isn't challenged,
just that it's good.

108
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
You can use the role of the therapist 
then to somehow recreate what sounds to 

109
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
me like you're describing there may say 
is a kind of spiritual experience that 

110
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,560
people perhaps to do.
You know,

111
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,890
the example you used is like when you're
in love with somebody.

112
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,883
I like that like in a non romantic 
context that it that would pop pop 

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,513
possibly a person with a mom or a rabbi 
or a priest or a shaman where you feel 

114
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:54,854
like I am being myself.
Here I am present kind of dangerous 

115
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,740
place to go with people,
isn't it?

116
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,093
I think that throughout history,
wherever you are and whatever culture 

117
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,660
and society,
they'll always be people who,

118
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,494
as you talked about then have different 
definitions but essentially help to 

119
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,334
navigate.
I think that my job in my therapy is 

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,474
navigation.
I'm not saying I absolutely direct the 

121
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,474
journey,
but if the truest waters ahead or if 

122
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:22,700
people keep making the same errors,
it's my job.

123
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,610
I feel to help them engage with that 
process,

124
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,444
learn,
move forward and not end up in the same 

125
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:28,934
position so to speak,
so I don't think it's my job to tell 

126
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,144
people what to do,
but I certainly think it would be 

127
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,493
without courage to listen to people 
constantly making the same mistakes and 

128
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,334
not encourage them to explore different 
avenues and to see different vantage 

129
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,194
points and that's something that I stay 
true to within my therapy and it's 

130
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:48,214
something that I think my own therapy 
when I was training was always the 

131
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,600
frustration.

132
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,523
I always felt like I wanted this person 
who was sharing the space with me to 

133
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,710
kind of fundamentally feel like they 
were with me.

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,873
I know that if you've not had therapy,
you might have experienced that with 

135
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:07,460
your parents or your friends.
That might be moments in your life where

136
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,260
you just feel that that person is with 
you.

137
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,810
You don't even need to have words.
There's just a sense of being.

138
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,930
And I used to feel a frustration that I 
never felt that.

139
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,890
So potentially if I'm looking at it on a
psychological level,

140
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,260
you know,
there is a level of me wanting to create

141
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:26,261
that experience for my client because I 
think that everybody in life needs to be

142
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,194
able to replicate that.
I think true happiness comes from 

143
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,680
feeling that you find are those that 
share that space in that way and then if

144
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,514
you have had that in therapy,
you can go out and when you feel it 

145
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,560
elsewhere,
you know it's good and you want to stick

146
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,660
with it.
And that's something I think it's really

147
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:45,230
important to almost transplant that 
experience into reality for the client.

148
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm going to say some bold things now.
He'd come those bold things.

149
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,253
I think it's difficult for me to make 
grand statements because I only know 

150
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:56,490
what it's like to be America like in 
America or in or broadly speaking,

151
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,920
so privileged western democracy type 
places,

152
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,070
but it seems like there's some sort of 
mental health crisis going on.

153
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,920
Addiction epidemics,
self harming,

154
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,970
a in disorders.
It seems to me like sort of a.

155
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:08,804
and you know,
I know there's more information 

156
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,284
available.
I'm sure there's all sorts of social 

157
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,030
factors and various contributors leading
to this statement.

158
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,820
It seems like people are crying out for 
some sort of connection to nature.

159
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,830
One of the people are very much respect 
to early guests on the show.

160
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,843
Adam Curtis says that politics is as 
lost its ability to talk about feeling 

161
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,000
the way that people feel that politics 
has become sort of managerial.

162
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,781
That people say,
well,

163
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:31,614
we'll manage this for you.
There's no real vision of where we're 

164
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,840
going and what sort of the great sort of
like in the last century,

165
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,674
sort of the,
the great religious institutions have 

166
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:43,350
been challenged politic,
the great sort of experiments of fascism

167
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,184
and communism broadly.
We know once again we can say kind of 

168
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:52,281
failed or certainly fascism revver level
look at that and so like,

169
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,250
you know,
like mental,

170
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,143
like psychiatry therapy,
sort of like in a way a relatively new 

171
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,540
science and its relationship with 
neurology was an anatomy.

172
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,374
It's going to be ongoing as these 
connections and observations and new 

173
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,870
maps and merge.
But excuse me,

174
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,763
I feel that the,
the work that's being done in 

175
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,893
understanding how individuals feel in 
how groups feel it's going to be vital 

176
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,620
in reforming the way that we see 
ourselves,

177
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,230
the way that we participate in,
in society.

178
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,420
Um,
so emmy,

179
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,490
Emma,
as you have indicated,

180
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,180
a lot of people don't have the privilege
of engaging in therapy.

181
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:36,420
So how do people employ these 
principles?

182
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,310
What should we be looking for?

183
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,383
I mean,
I think that therapy is the ideal where 

184
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,580
you don't need it not wanting to get rid
of my job,

185
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,810
but ideally communities,
societies and neighbors,

186
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,120
friends,
people who are around you,

187
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,460
they can be the thing that you actually 
need.

188
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:54,690
And it would be my ideal,
you know,

189
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:59,280
the Nirvana would be that we support 
people without the need for any of that.

190
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,443
I think the medical model in the UK and 
in Western world is something that 

191
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:05,424
obviously has benefits to some degree,
but I think we're missing this vital 

192
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,310
link.
My feeling is that when I'm working with

193
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,310
so many people who are maybe suffering 
from really,

194
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,144
really severe depression and anxiety and
people who have manifestations with 

195
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,820
eating disorders,
for example,

196
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,073
when I'm hearing their stories,
I feel that compassion and empathy and 

197
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,643
time,
a nurture and a real engagement with 

198
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,124
getting to know the dysfunction and then
recognizing the function from within 

199
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,654
that dysfunction is what's required,
but that takes a huge amount of time 

200
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,780
when we're looking at it in the 
therapeutic context.

201
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,040
Money as you noted,
because the NHS is really burdened.

202
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,430
You know anybody out there who thinks 
that practitioners aren't trying to do a

203
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,264
good job.
It isn't that it's just the amount of 

204
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,904
people who genuinely need that care 
aren't receive and get and when you get 

205
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,570
that practitioner they're working with 
high level crisis,

206
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,210
do you not kind of doing the early 
intervention.

207
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,044
So for me the bigger question is how can
we as a society start to be more 

208
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,510
compassionate to people around us?
That's the big thing for me.

209
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,260
I always make an effort to get my note 
to know my neighbors.

210
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,990
It's a northern thing.
It's a working class thing,

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,600
right?
I'm going to be living in now.

212
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,320
Let me interfere in your business.
I'm also a trained therapist.

213
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,154
Now,
notice you're not communicating very 

214
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,910
well when you live on.
Yeah.

215
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,260
Obviously that would be one way of doing
it,

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,480
but you know that kind of thing that I 
think we have.

217
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:43,020
These are measurable opportunity in 
society to make ourselves more healthy.

218
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,093
You said things like going outside and 
even when you're working with people in 

219
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:48,744
despair,
one of the big things that you want to 

220
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,230
do is look at their diet,
looking at their exercise regime,

221
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,064
look at how often they get outside,
look at who they socialize with because 

222
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,350
human beings are human and they're 
social animals,

223
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,184
and if they haven't got access to any of
those things are they're not eating 

224
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,570
efficiently and they're not exercising 
at all,

225
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,613
that's manifesting more problems.
So helping people to deconstruct is one 

226
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:09,174
of the things I would say.
You don't need a therapist to explore 

227
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,743
how to impact on your life more 
positively through food or through the 

228
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,794
amount of exercise you give yourself or 
the white light that you get on your 

229
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,764
skin or the Times that you knock on your
neighbor's door and ask for a cup of 

230
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:22,584
tea.
There are things that are within reach 

231
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:24,834
to everybody.
Even people who have low socioeconomic 

232
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,610
standards can still afford to eat 
better,

233
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,450
if that makes sense.

234
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,040
What interests me about the work that 
you do is you see that on this podcast a

235
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,110
lot.
It's very cerebral now know your sort of

236
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,260
a qualified clinicians,
so like you know,

237
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,000
like not like I recognize that you can 
also communicate on that level,

238
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,520
but say you know,
when we're talking to people that are,

239
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,820
as it were,
conventional academics,

240
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:58,821
it's likely you feel the weight and 
freight of their experience and study.

241
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,193
But when I'm like for,
it's like one of the reason I'm doing 

242
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,420
this podcast because I do a degree 
religion in,

243
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,830
in global politics.
So as university,

244
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,664
when I'm sitting in someone's unpacking 
the upanishads for me or vedic 

245
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,120
literature,
what I'm always thinking and probably is

246
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,640
affecting my ability to learn is how 
does this relate to me now?

247
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,780
Like you know me now out,
do I apply that if this doesn't apply to

248
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,510
my experience of being human than a,
I don't care.

249
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,070
You know.
And you know,

250
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,933
like I know a lot of people will listen 
to this podcast where mental health is 

251
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,540
probably the thing that's uppermost.
I know there's a lot of people listen to

252
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,090
these things for self betterment.
They want to learn,

253
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,043
they want to know more stuff.
But I think a lot of people that are 

254
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:41,250
like,
right,

255
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,083
yeah,
I'm not happy and like sort of self 

256
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:44,240
harm,
eating disorders,

257
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,320
drink too much.
Thanks so much.

258
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:46,850
Drugs,
feeling alienated,

259
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:47,684
feeling lost and like something like in 
a guy in her next door neighbor and ask 

260
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,330
for a cup of tea says something about 
the kind of society we're living in that

261
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:56,750
that's bloody sounds like quite radical 
thing to do.

262
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,243
It does feel like that for lots of 
people because we've kind of become so 

263
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,950
disassociated from to some degree what 
makes us happy.

264
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,233
I also think we spend a lot of time 
trying to avoid difficult feelings 

265
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:12,500
because we've been told that difficult 
feelings or something we should run from

266
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,334
or feel ashamed of or challenge in a way
by using alcohol or drugs or sex or 

267
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:20,900
anything that helps us escape those 
feelings.

268
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,990
For me,
I did that the years,

269
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,720
you know,
I run away from all of the feelings that

270
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:28,554
essentially I needed to confront so that
I could work through them and find why 

271
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:32,574
feel is a piece with the part of me that
I think I felt was dark and it's not 

272
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,020
dark.
It's just human.

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,370
But before I can reach others,
I have to reach into myself.

274
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,690
I have to feel that connection with 
myself.

275
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,990
So the reason I can ask now and I asked 
people for what I need if.

276
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,883
Because I know that I have enough 
resources within myself to manage 

277
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,033
whether they reject me or otherwise,
and that's something that's given me a 

278
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,174
real freedom average to get there 
through accepting that I was never ever 

279
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,093
going to find what I wanted through the 
avenues that I was seeking in the man 

280
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,233
you know,
had an aneurysm and having all of those 

281
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:16,370
areas of my world that I thought were 
bringing me happiness,

282
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:19,940
but that was so temporary and moment or 
a that they really gave me,

283
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,390
I suppose what you were saying earlier 
on like that spiritual connection,

284
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,224
that sense of.
I like the fact that I think I'm really 

285
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,700
this tiny little.in
infinity,

286
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,130
but that that's amazingly miraculous and
the this moment is blink of an eye of my

287
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:35,484
consciousness is mindblowing and taking 
it and reframing it from that 

288
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:42,650
perspective has been incredibly helpful.
Firstly,

289
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,484
because it gives me a humility where I 
know that as long as I do as little 

290
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,290
harm,
I hope I've done

291
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,300
a decent job and go on,
go on,

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,753
go into a therapy session with as little
damage as possible with fuck every one 

293
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,890
smack in the mouth.
How does.

294
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,973
See.
I understand what you're saying about 

295
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,030
sort of like a,
you know,

296
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:06,864
the sort of miracle being and acceptance
that is difficult to resolve yourself 

297
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,790
outside of yourself.
How did you get there though?

298
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,624
How did you get from being an adolescent
who was a truman and inferred that 

299
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,110
heaven is him played its part of your 
journey.

300
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,093
How did you become disillusioned?
We've had aneurysm and is it that 

301
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,180
reached you because you said you were 
initially,

302
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,014
you were not a lot.
You didn't feel satisfied with the 

303
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:33,240
therapeutic experiences you had as a 
teenager.

304
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,620
What you must,
I'm guessing,

305
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,710
have had some kind of satisfying 
experience with therapy at some point.

306
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,400
A lot of it was to do with the self work
that I did so many years ago.

307
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,593
Not that I do this now.
I kind of became quite intrigued with 

308
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,090
things like the runic alphabet and using
things like an overview of a runic.

309
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,770
Every day I started writing to myself,
journaling myself,

310
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,790
learning that actually it was okay to 
make mistakes.

311
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,633
One of the big things that I used to do 
is go to bed and over analyze every 

312
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,870
single conversation that I'd had for 
fear that I would have offended somebody

313
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,660
and then everything.
Honestly,

314
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:09,540
every day it was exhausting and then I 
learnt that actually,

315
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,950
you know what?
It really,

316
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,630
it doesn't matter unless there was 
intent there late.

317
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,780
I might offend people.
I might upset people.

318
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,703
I might at times hurt people,
but my intention is not to accepting 

319
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:27,941
that I can't always be responsible for 
another human being's pain or resolve or

320
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:32,080
journey and instead the all I can do is 
be with them on it.

321
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,090
Even if they reject me or if they accept
me.

322
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,370
That's the journey of life.
That's it.

323
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,473
That's what I'm here for.
I think having children was a big 

324
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,390
awakening.
When you say,

325
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,190
what was it?
No,

326
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:44,024
15 years ago I had a baby and everything
I thought had meaning just totally 

327
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,064
transformed like all I believed.
Until then was that though as this book 

328
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,500
search in life that there was this huge 
search for something,

329
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,600
if anything,
this thing that filled this gap,

330
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,270
I'm not suggesting that everyone runs 
off and acid.

331
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,263
Yep.
But the minute I held him like I'd had 

332
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,004
no maternal experience or feelings,
I got pregnant because I was told I 

333
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:11,054
couldn't have children,
so one I'd always lived a life where if 

334
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,160
you told me I couldn't do something,
I would find a way to do it.

335
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:18,770
That's still a philosophy I kind of live
my life by,

336
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,020
but I had fertility treatment.

337
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,853
I had a baby.
I held him and I was blown away because 

338
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:28,010
there was this magnificence of being an 
ordinary,

339
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,993
ordinary miracle.
Just an everyday thing that people do 

340
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,710
all the time,
but he changed everything.

341
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,890
Like he made me the best version version
of myself.

342
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:37,724
He made me realize I was far more 
compassionate and patient that I even 

343
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,493
knew I cut those resources to be.
Both of my children have consistently 

344
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:46,924
reminded me that I have an abundance of 
love that I never even knew I could tap 

345
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,590
into and everybody finds something.
Eventually.

346
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,500
Some people find exercise,
some people find nature,

347
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,040
some people find friendship for me.
Motherhood.

348
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,330
Motherhood was it.

349
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,430
You did thank you that you have.
Oh well you,

350
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:08,264
you said some things that are about in a
way embracing convention and identity 

351
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,990
because I've had a similar experience or
I'm having quite new for me,

352
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,170
still a similar experience as a parent.
This like certainly disrupting myself.

353
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:25,750
Centerdness trying to stick to the self 
centered but as someone.

354
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,763
Several people in the house.
But you also earlier in it you talked 

355
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,240
about sort of like.
You know what again,

356
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:37,241
as I say like often when I'm talking to 
like academics and stuff in here,

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,320
if like runic letters or the itching 
come up,

358
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,463
right?
People would like you clear off because 

359
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,440
this is like,
like you know,

360
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,470
we live in a that don't really like to 
recognize sort of folk.

361
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,981
I guess.
I don't know.

362
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:54,814
Folk history and something I'm becoming 
more and more interested in and I know 

363
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:58,631
that sort of,
again,

364
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:03,631
given that you are a psychotherapist,
like that is interesting,

365
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:04,490
isn't it?

366
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,990
That I'm fascinated by Carl young.
I'm fascinated with.

367
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's intrigued with like Kundalini Yoga 
and the itching and ways of dealing with

368
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:19,021
the mystery because let's face it,
the unknown is where we all get to.

369
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,640
I was listening to,
um,

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,060
sort of a debate or a conversation I 
suppose between Sam Harris,

371
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:30,070
the atheist,
that neurologist and sort of pundit and,

372
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,940
and Richard Dawkins and they were 
talking about how,

373
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:34,774
you know,
it's like the sort of the beauty of the 

374
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:38,830
theory of evolution and it's certainly 
sort of his magnificent.

375
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,664
The way I'm packed.
Our understanding of sort of material 

376
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,540
evolution of,
you know,

377
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,310
it's a great masterpiece in determining 
ideas of like,

378
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:51,670
of all time.
But like of course it says that,

379
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,533
you know,
we,

380
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,693
we can,
we don't know how it begins or how it 

381
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,590
can begin this moment of inception.
So at some point,

382
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,453
you know,
like we all have to interface with the 

383
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,300
unknown and,
and I,

384
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,143
I suspect,
and I sort of feel like I know that 

385
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:11,860
there are limitations for our capacities
as human beings to hold knowledge,

386
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,020
but knowledge is potential for 
knowledge,

387
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:16,990
is infinite capacity for understanding 
is fine,

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,320
that there's going to be faith is going 
to be required,

389
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,400
a way of dealing with the unknowable is 
going to be a requirement now like when,

390
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,253
if we have a type of culture that 
prohibits that because it's seen as woo 

391
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:31,760
woo or sort of like.

392
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,100
I think actually one of the things that 
I'm sensing is it sort of a part of this

393
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:36,934
is to do with Patriarchy and misogyny.
The oppression of the female principal 

394
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,903
of the flow of things in a male nurse is
a kind of a self contained idea in a 

395
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:47,884
way.
The female femininity as it relates to 

396
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,570
creativity,
both biologically and socially is a sort

397
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,440
of a.
It I sent down,

398
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:58,274
I'm being very basic here,
but this is kind of a flow to the idea 

399
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,560
of femininity.
I wonder,

400
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,540
uh,
how this printer,

401
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,650
how men can embrace their own femininity
and how,

402
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:12,940
uh,
the feminine principle being bought into

403
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,803
life and it like as sort of these,
these ideas of connectedness that you 

404
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,100
talk about,
uh,

405
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,943
how,
what do you think is the significance 

406
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,140
and how can we learn more and how can we
enact them?

407
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,340
I think that the men this modern age is 
a confusing one.

408
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,270
I think there have been so many changes.
There's so much more androgyny.

409
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,670
Women obviously,
and rightfully so,

410
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,910
at least getting to a point where there 
is more equality,

411
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,953
certainly not equality,
but in the western world there is more 

412
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,104
equality.
I think that the thing that men need to 

413
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,250
acknowledge is that firstly,
the human

414
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,990
animals and the need for connection is 
absolutely instinctual.

415
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,991
It's not about them being weak because 
they need somebody to support them.

416
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,403
When they vocalize their pain and men 
just don't vocalize their pain as often 

417
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:03,680
as they should.
That's why it kills them.

418
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,280
That's why suicide is such a high rate 
in men under 40 for example,

419
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,030
we know this,
but actually taking that step,

420
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,103
that brave step to say,
I'm in pain to say I don't know what to 

421
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,184
do,
to say I'm confused with all these 

422
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,050
stereotypes and schemers about what a 
man should be.

423
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,520
To me.
When you become at one with yourself,

424
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,354
male or female,
you recognize the very thing that you 

425
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,480
need as a human is to just say,
I'm a mess.

426
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,763
I'm a mess sometimes,
and within that mess is something 

427
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:37,394
incredibly beautiful masterpiece based.
I tell all my clients and particularly 

428
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:46,190
in the man who struggled with the 
authenticity and the ability to just say

429
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,024
I'm in pain and to not know what to do 
is to acknowledge that that's a 

430
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,180
completely generic feeling.

431
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,043
That's the human condition.
If anybody tells me they know exactly 

432
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,030
why they're here and they know exactly 
what they're doing,

433
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,820
then I think that they're not being 
honest with themselves.

434
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:02,720
I think,
in fact,

435
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,613
it's the wonder of not knowing that 
makes life the journey that becomes the 

436
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:07,874
potential to make everything that you 
experience in this world feel that it 

437
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,940
has something more guttural,
more cerebral,

438
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,460
as you said,
like there's something more,

439
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,440
I don't know what that is,
and it's okay.

440
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,750
It's the not knowing of knowing to some 
degree,

441
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,913
so what do men need to do?
I think they need to trust themselves 

442
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,084
more.
They need to trust that you don't need 

443
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,484
to have the answers to find a way and 
that there'll be people around you who 

444
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,620
will offer you that spark of support and
that the only way that we can start that

445
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,550
is when we give permission to each other
to follow that through.

446
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,803
So for every man to give another man 
that permission for every woman to meet 

447
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:49,430
that permission with care and compassion
because it's not just a male thing.

448
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,720
If we want our men to be protective 
leaders,

449
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,500
then it's very difficult for them to be 
weak and vulnerable.

450
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,950
Likewise,
women want to be leaders as well,

451
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,550
but at the same time the androgynous 
confused and,

452
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,670
and I think that that's why we're having
so many of these problems because it's a

453
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:10,520
very simple process.
Acknowledge how you feel.

454
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,070
Tell some day,
vocalize it,

455
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,170
received the support,
work up,

456
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,010
support a move forward.
It's not an atb experience,

457
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,100
but it's certainly a place that begins 
the change we need to connect more.

458
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,440
We choose not to is a choice.
Everything's a choice.

459
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,810
That's what we're choosing to do,
which using not to.

460
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,420
We're in a tender world,
a throwaway world,

461
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,553
a world where actually deep connection 
is something that's almost becoming 

462
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,953
avoided just because there is so much 
able connection that isn't really with 

463
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,590
those things are compromised and goes.

464
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,890
As human beings,
you know,

465
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,873
we used to be this kind of really small 
group of people as you would know and 

466
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:52,590
you know who did use things like 
divination,

467
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,453
things that kind of made sense to them 
and in that community that worked 

468
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:00,390
effectively.
We see that in the past and yet for some

469
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,690
reason with materialism and capitalism 
and as you said,

470
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:04,524
the politics and let's be honest,
the place where it doesn't serve us to 

471
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:11,040
care for people because that's the wider
discussion,

472
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,874
isn't it?
It doesn't serve people who are doing 

473
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:17,040
well to some degree to care for those 
who are not.

474
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,280
And yet the answer is that that's the 
answer.

475
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:23,100
And everyone who really thinks about it,
I can see that.

476
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,090
It curious how on a sort of a very basic
level,

477
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:27,924
things like eat the food that's in 
season in the place where you're living 

478
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,920
is like a sort of good for you because I
like,

479
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,763
they're sort of like,
there's a sort of a little code that's 

480
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:36,560
all there.

481
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,140
So if a food's known season,
it's haven't been transported,

482
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,520
it won't be good for you.
Like,

483
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,930
so I wonder if there is an analogy with,
like you said,

484
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,931
with compassion and um,
and sort of a subtler forms of feeling.

485
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,373
And I wanted to ask you about sex and 
sexuality both as a therapist and as I 

486
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,550
am mother of both your sons,
teenagers,

487
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,980
teenagers,
two teenage boys.

488
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,110
So how do you.
I'm like,

489
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,290
you're a therapist.
You produce,

490
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,193
so like gender and sex.
They were recovered with time where all 

491
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,760
of this stuff is being repoed and 
reexamined.

492
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,643
And so like as a mother of two sons who 
are presumably at a point where these 

493
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:26,190
kind of ideas are integral,
how do you,

494
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:29,010
uh,
what kind of instruction,

495
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,650
what kind of work do you see your role?
Um,

496
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,484
in my role as a mom since day when it 
has to have conversations with them 

497
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,490
about everything.

498
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,830
And I mean it,
I don't care who judges me for that.

499
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,903
I don't care who judges me because at 
the end of the day I'll talk to them 

500
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:41,634
about porn.
I've talked to them about what a girl 

501
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:46,500
will want on the first day and what she 
definitely won't want.

502
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,613
I talk about the political standards 
that are given to women as far as their 

503
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:54,060
objectification of their bodies or 
sexualization of young girls.

504
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,430
The expectations young girls put on 
themselves.

505
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,503
I constantly tell them that they are 
essentially the future generation of 

506
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:05,760
young men and that they have to 
consistently accept that women girls are

507
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:10,710
equals and I'm absolutely honest.
I mean we'll still,

508
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,150
I'm so honest,
you know,

509
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,750
they know what porn is.
They know why porn exists.

510
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,673
They know what that does some degree to 
women and they accept the things that 

511
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:23,490
they see if they see them.
That's not real.

512
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,700
That's not what we're looking for in 
good relationships.

513
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,950
Whatever you want in a relationship is 
great.

514
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,770
Whatever suits your fancy,
that's okay in a loving,

515
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,604
committed,
connected relationship or at least in a 

516
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,330
mutually respectful relationship.
Mr.

517
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:39,690
Do you think then that the porn is the 
sex?

518
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,410
What our action movies to life and,
and,

519
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,373
and if so because I've started to think 
of porn is very sort of toxic and 

520
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,920
dangerous thing and I have a 
relationship with it.

521
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,350
There's a bit like,
you know,

522
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,680
I find it hard to not look at 
pornography and it's one of the things I

523
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,750
think that shouldn't look at porn.
Porn is bad,

524
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,883
but like if you like,
but you also are you less puritanical 

525
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,023
kind of thing?
I don't think that porn is necessarily 

526
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:05,900
bad because I think that it has a place 
in chain Cina.

527
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,120
We're obsessed with bodies.

528
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,953
We like watching people have sex.
We liked the fact that people have 

529
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,074
different interactions and fantasy is 
really important and particularly for 

530
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,343
men and women who like to have visual 
stimulus when that happened to 

531
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:18,160
masturbate,
that can be really,

532
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:18,994
really helpful for them.
What I don't like about porn is it 

533
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,264
consistently places the woman on the 
whole as a submissive and it also 

534
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:26,974
suggests that women like certain things 
that I've never met a client 

535
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:34,120
particularly who likes the fact that 15 
men are going to come on their face.

536
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,850
I have to say that's not something that 
the average one wants,

537
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,730
but that kind of footage is viewed again
and again and again.

538
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,960
Do you think that must be the men when 
looking at pornography?

539
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,100
The fear must be a component.
I'm getting if,

540
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:48,934
if,
if Paul needs to demonstrate men as 

541
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:51,940
being powerful,
it seems to move it.

542
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,773
It might be catering for the fact that 
men feel impotent and powerless trying 

543
00:30:56,141 --> 00:31:00,790
to redress that,
so there's a an a bias in pornography to

544
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:05,200
men being powerful because in effect men
feel powerless and impotent and afraid.

545
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,153
I think that's a really good way of 
describing it and when I feel almost 

546
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:13,300
like there's an underlying rage within 
porn when I see some of it,

547
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,223
you know,
when I constantly look online to see 

548
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,340
kind of what is being mirrored out there
at the moment.

549
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,174
No.
So what expectations would be informed 

550
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,034
on 15 year old boys and girls are 
looking at the expectations and what 

551
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,160
they should want in relationships or in 
one night stands or whatever.

552
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,750
I feel this like rage that it's almost 
like we have to abuse her.

553
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:36,130
We have to destroy her to some degree.
She has to enjoy it even though it's not

554
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,083
clearly enjoyable and that concerns me,
but it also suggests that there is some 

555
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:47,491
kind of change in the way that we are 
playing out our sexual fantasies.

556
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,660
I want people to realize that whatever 
your fantasy,

557
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,350
that's okay.
As long as it is respectful.

558
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,350
As long as the other person is premium 
party to that,

559
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm willing to be within that fantasy 
itself.

560
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,720
I don't think anybody should be afraid 
of exploring it.

561
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,990
I constantly teach my clients that shame
is the worst thing you can have in sex,

562
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,630
and one of the things about porn is I 
think that's a big part of it.

563
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:18,631
That same rage and shame that we almost 
play out these things on screen that are

564
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,553
uncomfortable.
Why is shame find its way into 

565
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,524
sexuality?
Because we're shocked because we're 

566
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:25,864
ashamed of our sexuality early in life.
I think that we are taught shamed so 

567
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:30,934
much in our society.
I think from day one you are told that 

568
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,610
sex is bad.
You can only do it at this age.

569
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:37,990
You should only do it for this reason.

570
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,823
You should only do that with this 
protection that you kind of have this 

571
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,070
rhetoric already,
but then at the same time,

572
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,170
because we don't just have these really 
open,

573
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,000
honest conversations when kids are 
growing up,

574
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,133
you know,
how often does somebody go into a 

575
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:53,030
classroom and talk honestly about sex?
Talk honestly about relationships.

576
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,130
So honestly about how good it is and how
bad it can be so that you've kind of got

577
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:58,964
rid of any need for the shame and you've
engaged with everybody in a way that 

578
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,154
they can acknowledge they don't need to 
feel stupid or embarrassed or 

579
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,154
humiliated.
We formed those norms because our mates 

580
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,750
at school are kind of making us feel 
that what we're doing,

581
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,584
if we're having sex,
it's promiscuous or what we're doing if 

582
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:18,200
we don't have sex,
frigid.

583
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,520
Those kinds of conversations occur 
because adults aren't guiding them.

584
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
Like how do we help kids grow into young
men and women who love sex and embraced 

585
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:31,070
it for what it is and feel no shame.

586
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,290
We do it by just being honest with them 
and people are horrified about that.

587
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,360
I'll talk about on tv,
I'll say,

588
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:39,194
let's just start educating them from day
one and people think you're stealing 

589
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:44,300
childhood,
but you're not stealing childhood.

590
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,583
Your creating solid allard.
Adults who can become well adjusted in 

591
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,714
the way that they feel about sex.
How can you do that sort of with a 

592
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,373
group?
Because I suppose the reason that 

593
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,670
there's the,
the,

594
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,503
the suggestion or you're still in 
childhood is because it's like these 

595
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:02,660
children are not interested in sex and 
your imposing it on them,

596
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:03,494
you know,
so there's an argument of normally like 

597
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,093
around in a way enforcing and 
establishing norms around types of 

598
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,054
sexuality.
Isn't it like in clause 28 being a 

599
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,310
famous example of like,
Oh,

600
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,173
don't teach kids that are almost 
sexuality is normal because otherwise 

601
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:20,710
they'll find out that it's normal.

602
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,390
So,
uh,

603
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,880
so I suppose the,
how do you teach a group like a group of

604
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:29,714
children because presumably there are 
children that have different 

605
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,360
expectations,
levels of curiosity around sexuality.

606
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:37,100
How can,
how can you teach it?

607
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,440
I think that you teach it early,
really,

608
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,510
really early.
And when I say honestly,

609
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,600
five years old onwards,
I'm not talking about having sex at five

610
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,970
years old.
I'm talking about what sex is,

611
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,580
how you arrive,
why your born.

612
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,720
That starts the beginning of the 
conversation by when kids.

613
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,910
Because presumably what,
when,

614
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,550
when I was thinking about it before he 
was answering,

615
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,384
I was thinking right when I would teach 
my kid about sex will be when the kid 

616
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,740
asks.
No,

617
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,583
I wouldn't talk about when they ask 
because children are full of fear 

618
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,863
children.
I think that so many adults forget to 

619
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:09,980
look back to how it was,
you know,

620
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,230
I can remember clearly when I was four 
and five years old,

621
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:14,900
I used to suffer from really terrible 
ticks as a child.

622
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,733
Like I had really,
really bad touch which have been 

623
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,813
twitching about our terrible,
terrible techs have every single one of 

624
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:24,850
them from linking.
Next let's try to getting.

625
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,900
And um,
it was anxiety.

626
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,070
It was a physical eyes.
I didn't want to feel anxiety.

627
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:31,904
So I use text to manifest that.
And it was because I was so aware of 

628
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,940
everybody else's judgment around me.
People would say things to me and open.

629
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,080
Like I remember a guy saying to my dad,
oh,

630
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,470
she's such a funny girl that was there.
I was far.

631
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,613
I was five.
And I've looked back on those times and 

632
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,093
always transplanted the recognition that
these kids out there that everyone 

633
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,700
thinks it just these naive little 
players in life,

634
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,633
they're hypersensitive,
hypersensitive and they're having these 

635
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,784
conversations and they're worried about 
friendships and they haven't a clue why 

636
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,440
the world's working the way that it's 
working.

637
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,990
But you know what you can do.
You can make them feel so safe.

638
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,660
Adults can make kids feel so safe.
When I was working on projects where the

639
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,760
young people had had no education,
where they were involved in the criminal

640
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,400
justice system where people had 
completely given up on them.

641
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,563
The first job that I had was to make my 
boys and girls feel safe because it was 

642
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,250
a feeling that everyone assumes people 
know,

643
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,250
but very few people really know how to 
do it.

644
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,760
By being authentic is number one.
By reassuring them that they're okay.

645
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,390
Even when some of that actions are not 
okay,

646
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,920
that fundamentally within them there is 
an okayness that we can find that and we

647
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,230
can manifest it and that they can move 
forward.

648
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,363
My boys and girls and I say my boys more
than my girls because my 80 percent of 

649
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:55,800
my boys came to the projects,
about 20 percent were girls.

650
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,760
So I run um,
crime concerned projects.

651
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,920
I run college projects.
It was Pru,

652
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,783
pupil referral unit.
So when kids had failed in mainstream 

653
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,750
education,
they would come to me,

654
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,410
but they would come to me after that 
failed in a mainstream pru.

655
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,880
So I got the Pru,
Pru,

656
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:16,881
kids and I remember that.
I remember my life that are low.

657
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,600
That's wild though.
Yeah,

658
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,350
well I remember like those times with 
summer,

659
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,350
I honestly in my head,
summer,

660
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,010
um,
I still keep in contact with some of the

661
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,320
young people if I'm honest.
It's a long time since I worked on those

662
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,154
projects,
but what I recognized immediately was 

663
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,750
that they hated me when they first 
bought,

664
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,400
they hated me.
They were like,

665
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:38,940
one called.
I was called posh batch was number one,

666
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,840
even though I'm not working class,
but my accent was different to theirs,

667
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,133
but it was okay.

668
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,980
So there's a scowl.
If you've been kicked out,

669
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,940
the thing that you go to when you're 
kicked out or things you might feel like

670
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:54,330
audrey hepburn after rex Harrison is my 
fair lady,

671
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,790
but you know what result,
that was the key.

672
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,760
The key to me was one,
always being myself,

673
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,110
always using the opportunity to inspire,
not to take away my boys particularly.

674
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:05,944
You had had their self esteem eradicate 
it to such a degree that but nine years 

675
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:10,140
old,
they weren't in the classroom.

676
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:10,974
They were sent outside to play.
They didn't know how to read and why at 

677
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,681
13,
14,

678
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:14,461
15,
16.

679
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,710
If you can't read and write,
you don't feel like you belong.

680
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,320
You don't have access.
Shamed.

681
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,410
It's horrible and that's the other thing
when you talk about academia as well.

682
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,230
Academia is amazing.
People are really bright.

683
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,213
They seek out and suit themselves with 
that area of expertise and it's 

684
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,700
brilliant,
but at the same time it creates a elite.

685
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,450
My boys would look at people in 
education,

686
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,870
even people with gcse is let alone 
doctorates and professorships.

687
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,123
They would see an us and them.
My whole experience in life with my 

688
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:49,744
clients,
with the young people I had the 

689
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,200
privilege to work with,
with my children,

690
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,393
I want it to be as an author.
I want it to feel like there is no 

691
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,620
difference.
We are human,

692
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,100
therefore we're equal.
I may know this and you may know that,

693
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,490
but there is something intrinsic.
I say to every single client that I have

694
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,820
when they're questioning themselves more
than nature,

695
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:10,654
as you brought up nature before and 
everybody has their own opinions on 

696
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,500
this.
Personally,

697
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,720
I think nature has an answer for 
absolutely everything.

698
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,554
I think she's incredibly bright and she 
knows exactly what she's doing and why 

699
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,020
she's doing it.
Whether we see those solutions or choose

700
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:23,854
to ignore them,
whether politically we're allowed to 

701
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,280
have those solutions or have them with 
help from us.

702
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,010
That's the difference in that 
suggestion,

703
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:30,844
you know,
but one thing I know is that every 

704
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,914
single human being out of all these 
billions of people have one thing to 

705
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,064
print.
I don't for one minute believe that 

706
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:43,291
mother nature decided to give every 
single human being a marketing so unique

707
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,570
to them that that wasn't reason and 
purpose.

708
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,150
I teach every single child that I ever 
worked with.

709
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,283
Every client you were marked,
you were marked with something that 

710
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:57,910
stands you out from every other person.
Finding it is the issue.

711
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Finding it of beautiful.
I think that that word communicate.

712
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,380
It means create community.
Create connection.

713
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,810
Absolutely.
So you're good at doing that.

714
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:13,510
Then it was this thing up,
so add to get rid of them.

715
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,463
Terrible ticks,
which is a phrase that when it first 

716
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:17,134
came out,
I'm sure called Constellation in an 

717
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,000
audio medium that might be a new teller 
for show.

718
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,470
Actually terrible ticks presented by Mr 
Kenney with several ticks,

719
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:28,720
but do self down.
I'm higher,

720
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:32,230
I terrible texture.
I am still happy.

721
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,650
Where's your,
where are your tie control them?

722
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,060
How sometimes I go to the toilet and I 
go back for a bit.

723
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,500
I still have my texts I have is um,
it's physicalized anxiety.

724
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:49,150
So I'm quite,
I would say I don't really feel low.

725
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:52,380
I don't really feel anxious,
but I'm aware that like anybody,

726
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:55,000
I have a certain amount of stresses and 
strains in my world and my life,

727
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,280
so my brain kind of just go,
ah,

728
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,500
just give yourself a bit of a twitch 
that's better than twitches and I do,

729
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,693
you know what?
I can still remember my mom when I was 

730
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,700
seven years old and I was quite a cute 
little kid with blonde pigtails,

731
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,590
but mum was working class,
but you know,

732
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,830
a really,
really great mother and she would put my

733
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:15,650
hair in pigtails.

734
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,920
She put me in a red coat.
She always coordinated everything.

735
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:19,660
We didn't have a lot,
but she made a real effort.

736
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:22,750
Me and my sister would look like we were
kind of quite well to do kids,

737
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,593
you know,
walking down the road and then I would 

738
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,070
cough,
do my neck,

739
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,963
do molag,
throw my shoulders out and she would 

740
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,214
just look at me with absolute despair.
There was a correlation between those 

741
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:38,831
two things with what Darwin you up or 
nice and you twitching eye out like some

742
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,540
little punk.
Back in the day.

743
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,374
I didn't know how to verbalize my pain 
and at the time there were certain 

744
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,974
things in my life that felt painful and 
that was a way of using my body to 

745
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,094
express my sadness.
I'm only learning now quite late in 

746
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,174
life.
How muck of it being a person too much 

747
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,800
or in the intellect and the body is 
where so much happened.

748
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,160
So you go get into your body.
Yes,

749
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,050
yes.
That's a big thing for me.

750
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:08,210
That has been a huge learning curve for 
me.

751
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,313
I used to analyze everything I used to 
feel that I had to work out every 

752
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:14,324
intrinsic piece and cellular experience 
that I had and it created so much noise 

753
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:23,060
and volume and what I've learned to do 
more recently is find this acceptance of

754
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:23,894
silence and switching off and allowing 
myself to kind of meditate on how my 

755
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,154
body feels like how my body feels,
not how my mind is and it's been so 

756
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:34,880
soothing and so helpful.
Pop Mindfulness of course,

757
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,930
isn't it?
I'm like,

758
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,800
I,
um,

759
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,813
like do Jujitsu and I'm probably one of 
the best people ask it in the world by 

760
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,600
one hour a week,
one hour,

761
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:46,290
where are like body.
Yeah.

762
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,163
I'm in my body and like sort of I'm 
physically close to another man 

763
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,740
wrestling.

764
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,573
It's sort of like,
it's our love it what you said before 

765
00:42:55,101 --> 00:43:00,101
about sex that is probably a really good
way of describing how the perfect sexual

766
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:01,634
encounter is.
It's when you're not in your head is 

767
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,840
when you're fully engaged with your 
body.

768
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:10,730
When you see yourself as playing and 
having pleasure and getting pleasure and

769
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:11,564
having no shame and just allowing 
yourself the experience whether that's 

770
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:18,350
in a one night stand or a longterm 
committed relationship and it's possible

771
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,890
and it's practical,
but you have to work through all of that

772
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,860
volume and get to a position where you 
accept your body before can move forward

773
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,720
or how do you block the territory.
It's a return to a point that we,

774
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:31,280
uh,
like we started.

775
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:36,281
But then you sort of terrible ticks.
And then for meditation like,

776
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,563
you know,
like introducing the subject of 

777
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,324
sexuality of children.
You said don't wait for them to ask 

778
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:43,550
about it.

779
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,250
Start introducing this one.
W,

780
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,690
W how?
Just have conversations with them.

781
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,130
You know,
from a very early age,

782
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:51,860
I started to talk about the anatomy of 
my body,

783
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,783
my children.
I was a single mom for quite a long 

784
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,170
time,
so as a single mom I had one bathroom in

785
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,004
my home,
which meant that my children always saw 

786
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:00,284
me naked,
so I started to have conversations with 

787
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:05,270
them about my body so that they 
understood what my boobs were,

788
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,283
what my vagina was.
They still laugh at the word vagina 

789
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,890
because we really had fun back in the 
day discussing all of those things,

790
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:16,280
the differences about that bodies then 
how they came about,

791
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:20,960
why they existed,
then what sex was and why it was and why

792
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:21,794
sex is something that they should one 
day enjoy and always feel that I'm the 

793
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:28,010
person they can come and converse with 
the barrel,

794
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,280
that both my boys are 13 and 15.

795
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,573
I don't know how I created them.
There are a lot better than I probably 

796
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:36,240
deserved if I'm really honest.
You know,

797
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,074
they're great kids,
but one of the things that strikes me 

798
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:42,960
about them is their emotional 
intelligence and they do not have fear.

799
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,470
They do not have the fear that I had 
about asking,

800
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,830
you know,
my son will talk to me about porn.

801
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,370
He'll talk to me about the fact that his
friends are talking about sex.

802
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,490
He'll have conversations with me about 
them and it's so,

803
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,450
so reassuring because it was simple.
It was simple.

804
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,540
I just made the communication clear that
there was no shame,

805
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,340
no embarrassment.
It was open.

806
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,900
I think it's because you want imagines 
that it will not,

807
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:10,734
you know,
that child's going to go into an 

808
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,410
environment where,
like in a moment ago,

809
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:16,260
we were talking about the kind of what 
exists in the world of porn,

810
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,960
the kind of access but young men,
boys,

811
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,510
girls are going to have to pornography.

812
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,200
But he's giving them some given a 
curious,

813
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,173
um,
usual on my assumption is dangerous 

814
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,950
messages are,
how is your life,

815
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,300
how do you feel as a therapist?
Is My prejudices Mr Kenney human being.

816
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,343
But how,
how is like a sort of a natural 

817
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,220
understanding of sex,
sex,

818
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,223
Julie consensual,
loving adult play where we communicate 

819
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,450
how like how's it going to survive that 
kind of institutional a deviation.

820
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,600
I fully believe that human beings know 
how to find that way.

821
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,790
I have a hope consistently.
People say,

822
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,240
how'd you work in certain circumstances?
For example,

823
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,120
with sexual abuse or with murdered 
children,

824
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:06,954
you know,
things like that that people would 

825
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,810
really struggle to work with.
How do you work with it?

826
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,270
And it's because I always have a sense 
of hope.

827
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,163
My belief system is hope orientated.
I think that no matter how much you 

828
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:21,801
present people with these caricatures,
these characatures of sexuality,

829
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,184
these characatures of having sex on 
screen in such a way that very few 

830
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:28,440
people would ever want to encounter.

831
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,780
In the end,
we don't want it.

832
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:33,210
We desensitize ourselves to it and we 
move on.

833
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,283
I hope that women,
if porn continues to hold itself in our 

834
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,304
society as it seems to be doing,
I hope that women start to feel that 

835
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:46,770
they should be involved in directing and
creating because fantasy is lost.

836
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,180
There is no fantasy in that.
It's so physical and mechanical.

837
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,320
There has to be something deeper.
Can I ask a question like,

838
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,330
because we hear this idea of like,
of course that is a one vision of female

839
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:03,150
empowerment is women being involved in 
the creation of pornography,

840
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:03,984
but in a sense isn't that a sort of 
coopting of femininity into a mountain 

841
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,830
bike because like you know when you sort
of say,

842
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,660
you know,
to raise a May being prime minister,

843
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,600
is that good for feminism?
Was Margaret Thatcher being present?

844
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,290
And of course it's good that women are 
in politics,

845
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:24,291
but I feel like like it's not actually 
doing the job that we're trying to do.

846
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,730
I have a second.
I would say,

847
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
don't get me wrong,
I would much rather what we have in our 

848
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,250
society is a far better relationship 
with sex.

849
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,143
It's as simple as that.
I wish that every young person growing 

850
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:45,211
up and every adult could learn early on 
to feel that their body is an incredible

851
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,070
tool that something they can really 
relate to.

852
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:48,904
They can enjoy that.
We could have experiences in society 

853
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,900
where people can go to lessons and 
actually have sessions with people where

854
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,840
they can really construct an identity 
with the sexuality,

855
00:47:58,990 --> 00:47:59,823
whether it was correct help for people 
who unfortunately have horrible sexual 

856
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:04,660
experiences.
You know,

857
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,643
the statistic is harrowing.
One in six children are sexually abused 

858
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:11,080
before the age of 16,
one in four girls,

859
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:12,580
one in eight boys.
That's real.

860
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,360
So people are growing up with a 
dysfunctional identity towards sex.

861
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:17,880
So a lot of it is the unraveling.

862
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,713
And when you say about porn,
porn kind of volumizes the negatives as 

863
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,034
well.
And I kind of wish that there was more 

864
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:28,660
regulation around that because I think 
you're never going to get rid of porn,

865
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,883
but I'd like to see women as equal 
players because you get these really 

866
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:37,441
kind of stereotypical vibes about what 
women should want and it's turning the.

867
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,460
I always thought,
I know this sounds awful by.

868
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,360
I say to people when I'm talking about 
sex,

869
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,660
you never been talking to younger 
people.

870
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,470
Don't expect anal sex and fisting when 
you have sex for the first time.

871
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,390
That's not what women want and it's not 
what you should feel you're pressured to

872
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,224
do,
but if you're watching this kind of 

873
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,800
stuff and that's your learning 
experience,

874
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,790
you absolutely think that that's a 
potential in the room scenario.

875
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,090
What pressure for guys,
what pressure for girls,

876
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,420
so to some degree it's the regulation,
but will that ever happen?

877
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,253
Of course not because it makes a lot of 
money and money will always be the 

878
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:11,674
bigger winner in life is extraordinary.
The way we have to incorporate these 

879
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,780
external influences on what is governing
the flow of what is normal,

880
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:24,340
what's determining normality.
It's interesting when something comes up

881
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,150
as a a,
a,

882
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,650
a bowl.
The word in a podcast as listing.

883
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,900
No,
not at all.

884
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,360
Please don't apologize for it.
Of course.

885
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:32,194
Like I record,
like I once heard about when there was 

886
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:39,160
earlier attempts to regulate the 
pornographic content for fisting was one

887
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:39,994
of the things that they looked at 
without considering the role that that 

888
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:49,111
plays in nonheterosexual communities.
I'm like,

889
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,083
sorry.
So regulation can often be used as a 

890
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:53,644
tool to normalize as opposed like when 
we're having open conversations about 

891
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:01,570
what sex is,
what sex should be,

892
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,613
but it's very important that that 
remains open and inclusive and 

893
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,653
nonjudgmental about different types of 
sexuality and the thing that I heard 

894
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:12,680
that made most sense to me was consent,
consent,

895
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:15,400
consent,
and who can't give consent,

896
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:18,340
children and a more mentally ill people.

897
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,400
Yeah.
I think though that the whole porn area,

898
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,120
it's one of those places that could have
purpose,

899
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:27,880
if that makes sense.
Could be something that could inspire or

900
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,530
it could be somebody that could free 
years and allow us our fantasies,

901
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,830
but to some degree the fact that a lot 
of people feel intense.

902
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,490
Shame watching porn plays into that dark
psyche anyway.

903
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,563
So I would like to see more people just 
normalizing the conversations around 

904
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:46,120
sex,
about talking about that preferences,

905
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,160
about expressing their fantasies without
fear.

906
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,520
I think there's so much fear built up 
within the sexual arena.

907
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,913
And Kenny,
thank you very much because I think 

908
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:58,690
communication is going to be vital in 
all areas of mental health,

909
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,553
all forms of human expression.
Verbal and sexual and it feels to me 

910
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:05,620
like the way that we relate to our 
feelings,

911
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:06,454
the way that we relate to forms of 
expression is vital in this time of 

912
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:10,114
disjunct,
in this time of Fisher separation 

913
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,000
conflict in so many fields like you 
know,

914
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:19,510
to once again find union,
but between people that no matter only I

915
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:23,670
suppose start with communication.
What an incredible journey it's been.

916
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:28,671
It seems for you from a great 
communicator to communicate.

917
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,463
I think you should have your own podcast
and that should be the strap sex talk 

918
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:40,370
obviously will be the title wherever 
Kenny,

919
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,270
but the strap from what was that a true 
and it's a congruent communicator.

920
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,680
Brilliant.
Listen,

921
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,170
thank you so much.
