1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,980
My accent changes,
I'm terrible,

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,410
may bounce up and down that class ladder
like little trees,

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:05,244
football in La,
like when I'm around like sort of like 

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,980
my girlfriend really torments me for 
life.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,150
She's like,
how much I love working class men.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,020
Like when we went to think it was called
Jewsons to pick up some gravel.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry that that's my life.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,103
And there's this bloke there called mark
and he came over and wanted to fight 

9
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,504
ots.
You laughed at that episode when it a 

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,073
photo and I was not a lot and I said 
goodbye to him in an overly elaborate 

11
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,150
way.
Can I even wave to him a second time for

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,180
another apartment?
Cherry out the window.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,440
No,
actually I think I might turn off,

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,350
but you don't sit at my.
Oh,

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,990
I taught our pal.
Good solid of Alpha power.

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,360
The tomato sauce,
guidestar.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,020
Bloody Cockney.
It's absolutely ridiculous.

18
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,210
What's going on?
Well,

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,130
that's exactly why we change our voices.
Uh,

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,590
interestingly,
the more we know this study,

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,650
we have to change our voices to talk to 
somebody.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,730
So soon as we started talking to each 
other without agreeing to do so,

23
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,803
we started to breathe together because 
you have to do that is have a 

24
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,324
conversation.
You have to coordinate how you breathe 

25
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,350
because that lets you time voices going 
back and forth,

26
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,600
the turn taking conversation.
So physical,

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,840
it really is.
And we also matched the pros,

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,060
the pitch and precedent by voices and 
the rhythm of our voices.

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,970
We start to bring together,
because you've got this very rhythmic.

30
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,804
He's like,
he's like a dance conversation and you 

31
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,950
can only do that dance if you start to 
align your behavior.

32
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,780
So that has to happen to talk.
And then the more you like someone,

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,930
the more you will start to do other 
things,

34
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,550
to change your voice,
to bring it towards them.

35
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,490
So there are studies that have shown 
that the more a man likes a woman,

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,990
well he will raise the pitch of his 
voice to be nearer to hers,

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,973
just notes.
And everybody's super self conscious 

38
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,894
about

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,023
right.

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,760
And you believe that you'll start to use
the same words.

41
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,594
You start to use the same pronunciation 
jeep and start to use the same grammar 

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
as each other and the and the more you 
like.

43
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,634
The most communication is here.
That's the whole point of it is that 

44
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,540
we're trying to make a connection with 
one another.

45
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,140
We're trying to defy the material prison
of our anatomy.

46
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,880
You're feeling trapped and it's the 
voice.

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,030
This thing that is not really holy or 
truly Uba vibration emanating from you.

48
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,023
That is your misery that you've sent out
in the world to make connections and 

49
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:15,594
communication with God.
I'm good at this and I'm just making 

50
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,640
this shit up,
but it's always there.

51
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,360
So it's always expressing like a lot of 
you that you don't realize and it's also

52
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,194
expressing how you feel about the people
that you're talking to fairly 

53
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,284
unavoidably.

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,153
Oh No.
I'm going to start watching myself back 

55
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,010
on track because one day Sundays we do a
bit of funny bit in my standup show,

56
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,844
right?
Where I talk about when we did this 

57
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,660
interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of 
the things that we make jokes about,

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm going to buy way.
I mean me because.

59
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,843
Because I'm mentally ill,
I consider myself for about nine people 

60
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,580
might actually have people at work with 
her in the room I'm like,

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,123
is that I love about how I go through 
these different personas when dealing 

62
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:53,670
with Jeremy Paxman,
they start very light and affable.

63
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,504
Then I got really serious and then I get
very sort of either deliberately or not 

64
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
deliberately,
but unconsciously referencing ethnic 

65
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,640
speak rhythms.
Yeah,

66
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,703
very working class based because I 
obviously see myself as speaking on 

67
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:13,780
behalf of outsiders and I use it as an 
attack technique.

68
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,700
It's very interesting to watch and your 
marketing because we can mark similarity

69
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,340
with it.
You can mark difference because.

70
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,831
Yeah,
right.

71
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,090
Because I'm definitely not try.
I don't go.

72
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,740
I knew I'd have to say.
I'm like,

73
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,620
no,
listen,

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,620
I'll take you down.
It's like ridiculous.

75
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,820
It's like a grime single,
but it's.

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,673
It's still playing your apps,
your eyes marking out your position to 

77
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,110
him as clearly and how you're doing 
that.

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,620
What you're saying.
I'm not like,

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,710
I don't particularly want to be you,
God.

80
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm just telling my cell phone.
