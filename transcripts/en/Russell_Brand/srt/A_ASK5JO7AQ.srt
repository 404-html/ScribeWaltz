1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,070
Welcome John to the scheme of Russell 
brand.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,953
My guest today is Andy [inaudible],
the accomplished presenter and writer 

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
and he's the cofounder and voice of the 
headspace app in his early twenties 

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,134
midway through a university degree in 
sports science and he made the 

5
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,680
unexpected decision to travel to the 
Himalayas to study meditation.

6
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:20,514
Instead,
it was the beginning of a 10 year 

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,160
journey,
which took him around the world.

8
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:23,994
Como La,
culminating with ordination as a Tibet 

9
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:30,480
and Buddhist monk in northern India.
He's transitioned back to normal life in

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,314
2004 sorry,
I'm training briefly at Moscow state 

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,124
circus before returning to London to 
complete a degree in circus arts with 

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:39,894
the conservatoire of dance and drama 
whilst drawing up the early plans for 

13
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:48,510
what was later to become headspace.
Welcome andy to under the skin.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,403
Thanks Russell.
Even though under the skin in this 

15
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,564
instance is taking place in your studio 
where you actually welcomed the 

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,040
headspace.

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,650
Thank you very much.
It's very generous of you to,

18
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,710
we've never done this before and under 
the skin we've always recorded it,

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,390
you know,
in various places.

20
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,250
In London,
we're in Los Angeles now.

21
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:10,251
We're in a one of the facilities of 
headspace and it's wonderful to be here.

22
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,564
The reason that I was strongly motivated
to meet you was because people kept 

23
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,440
mentioning headspace in under the skin 
at Stafford,

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,430
the a survival expert and I call him the
grunge bear grylls.

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,264
Not that I don't love bear grylls would 
be straight standard bear grylls 

26
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,260
vanilla.
I love that guy too,

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,630
but it's Stafford.
He's like the Nirvana version.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
He loves headspace and more and more 
people were mentioning headspace to me 

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,170
and I thought I'm going to have to meet 
the people that are headspace.

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,550
Thanks for coming in and this by the 
way,

31
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:44,580
I held this place you,
you're very welcome.

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,750
If you're,
if you're in La,

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,730
this is lovely to hear your voice.
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,620
I will take you,
I'll take you up on that.

35
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,380
Thank you.
That's really very generous of you.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,070
Now what as defined to headspace thus 
far,

37
00:01:56,071 --> 00:02:00,350
even though I know it's been a 10 year 
journey is it seems to me and and I,

38
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:05,351
I used the APP myself that you are 
making a meditation accessible,

39
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,070
fun.
Hello,

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,640
quill.
Hopefully I think you are.

41
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,980
I love the little animation videos at 
that and they're like,

42
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,814
what the reference points are for those 
creatures that I don't know quite what 

43
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:17,670
they are,
but I like him.

44
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,280
I love your tone.
I was talking to someone,

45
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm over here acting at the moment and 
uh,

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,700
I was talking to another actor on set 
and he was talking about meditation,

47
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,870
the challenges that he faces.
It goes,

48
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,490
you want to do headspace mate?

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,260
Like it's just like a British bloke 
going,

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,200
all right,
sit down.

51
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,960
Remember,
you don't need to shut your eyes.

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,480
Just relax.
It's not complicated.

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,490
And maybe,
hopefully you've watched the video.

54
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,500
If you haven't,
you might want to watch that now.

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,340
Like I don't,
and I sort of like what I feel like part

56
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,340
of what I've been trying to do myself is
to make,

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,560
not meditation because I'm not qualified
to bring it to people,

58
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,890
but certainly the conversation around 
spirituality,

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,060
I wanted to make it more accessible.
Tell me how this journey began for you.

60
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,040
Uh,
the journey into

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,380
meditation or headspace.
More specifically,

62
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,090
I think initially headspace.
How come you,

63
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,880
when I'm going to set up an APP and 
popularized meditation,

64
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,650
how have you done this?
Yeah,

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,020
well,
it's important to say,

66
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,190
so I'm,
I'm just,

67
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm just a,
I'm a cofounder,

68
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,660
so the other cofounder,
rich,

69
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,410
um,
rich pearson,

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,750
so very,
very dear friend now.

71
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,770
And this was,
uh,

72
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,683
was something that we came up with 
together and we've had an amazing team 

73
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,180
of people and also I love so much love 
and support from people along the way.

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,790
I think an ungrateful person because 
you're the real deal.

75
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:35,290
I knew you're a monk so you're not this 
brilliant idea of Ed space and I'm going

76
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,124
to smash it.
You're obviously is totally humble 

77
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,020
person to tune into the limitless,
but it's also the truth as well.

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,000
Cool.
We meet rich,

79
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,110
so we,
um,

80
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,790
I,
I left.

81
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,860
Um,
so I left the monastery and,

82
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,070
and decided to start teaching.
I was doing,

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,050
um,
one-to-one in a clinic back in,

84
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,420
back in London.
So this was,

85
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,920
you know,
we'll look at the circus thing later.

86
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,310
Um,
but kind of after the,

87
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,730
the circus,
I was kind of okay.

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,773
I knew kind of the language that I 
wanted to use and w and I knew by then 

89
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,554
what techniques,
so I kind of felt would work outside of 

90
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,790
the need to even feel compelled to do 
that.

91
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,020
And why did you think I want to 
popularize meditation?

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,410
What was the sense that you had that it 
was necessary?

93
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,440
This isn't,
this is more tricky cause it wasn't,

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,990
it wasn't like a,
a plan.

95
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,320
So in the same way people asking you,
why did you go away and become a monk?

96
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,070
I felt an overwhelming sense that that 
was what I had to do.

97
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,130
And I wasn't able to necessarily put it 
into two words.

98
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,430
And I didn't come up with a list of pros
and cons of,

99
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,600
of being a monk and not being a monk in 
the same way when I left the monastery,

100
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,410
I guess if it's helpful to take a step 
back and when I was teaching meditation,

101
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,244
so I had,
um,

102
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,920
uh,
the monastery had asked me to teach at a

103
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,754
meditation center in Moscow and I ended 
up living there for just over four 

104
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,600
years,
four and a half years.

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,273
And I would see different types of 
people and I'd often get expats coming 

106
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,364
along and they really wanted to learn 
meditation and they really wanted the 

107
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
benefits of meditation,
but they didn't necessarily want to 

108
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,424
adopt a faith.
They didn't necessarily want to chat to 

109
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,903
a guy in robes and to come into this 
kind of place where there was a lot of 

110
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,160
ritual and tradition.
So that was,

111
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,810
I think,
the beginning of me thinking,

112
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,803
well,
there's this need and what's more 

113
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,480
important to me?
Is it teaching meditation or is it being

114
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,314
a monk?
And I felt very strongly that teaching 

115
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:24,640
meditation was,
was more useful and that I could present

116
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,200
it in a way that I,
you know,

117
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,520
I didn't,
it didn't matter whether I was wearing a

118
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,390
shirt and tie or whether I was,
whether I was wearing kind of ropes,

119
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,830
you know?
So that was the beginning.

120
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:33,664
I would say.
What's the best thing about being a 

121
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,614
monk?

122
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,363
Strange as it may sound,
not having anything because there's 

123
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,620
nothing to worry about.
So yeah,

124
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,620
freedom you give,
you give away.

125
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,873
I mean,
which is strange because you're living 

126
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:53,680
within four walls and it's very kind of 
institutionalized in some ways.

127
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,730
But within that there is a,
you know,

128
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,643
freedoms from within and there was a,
an inner feeling of freedom and there's 

129
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,240
no,
you don't have to achieve anything.

130
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
You'd have to prove anything.
You don't have to worry about losing 

131
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,650
anything.
You own nothing that there's,

132
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,480
so there's a real sense of freedom in 
that.

133
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,363
In your case,
it was a Tibetan monastery in the 

134
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,300
Himalayas,
is that correct?

135
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,650
So it was,
uh,

136
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,130
I started in Himalayas and then I went 
to Burma and trained in a,

137
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,400
in a Burmese monastery.
And then eventually I ended up kind of,

138
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,263
uh,
going back to Tibetan monastery and 

139
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,360
doing five years.

140
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,830
And it's about in tradition.
Yeah.

141
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,850
Really?
Yeah.

142
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,730
And you,
the relationship with the guru,

143
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,350
I teach her,
it's kind of sacred thing,

144
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,540
isn't it?
Who is your teacher?

145
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,530
He is.
So,

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,700
um,
I think there,

147
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,030
there are different types of teachers 
along the way,

148
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,864
you know,
so there were more kind of instructor 

149
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,780
kind of type teachers are there,
people who they're the real deal,

150
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,640
they've,
they've put in the time and they've done

151
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,474
it.
But there,

152
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,940
there may be not kind of considered sort
of like as a,

153
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,941
as a guru or something like that.
And someone who was incredibly important

154
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,600
in my own personal kind of journey was 
a,

155
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,443
he's an Irishman called,
called Donald and Donald Donald was a 

156
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,340
real deal.
Like he,

157
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,270
he was,
he trained and he did just over 12 years

158
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,260
in,
in retreat,

159
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,840
in longterm retreat.
Um,

160
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,570
where did you encounter him and were 
already done them 12 years.

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,010
So he did 12 years.
He was,

162
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,844
he was on his way to the Himalayas and 
he stopped off at a monastery 

163
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,240
[inaudible] monastery in Scotland,
which is back in the 60s.

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,370
It just opened,
it just started.

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,713
And the Abbot of the monastery persuaded
him to stay and do a six month retreat 

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
rather than go to India.
And he finished a six month or to treat.

167
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,251
And they said,
well,

168
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,084
look,
we're just about to start the first 

169
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,430
three and a half year retreat,
you know,

170
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,170
would you,
it's the first one in the west.

171
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,004
It's kind of ever happened.
The Tibetans have this three and a half 

172
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,100
year retreat,
you know,

173
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,840
would you like to do it?
And Oh yeah,

174
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,520
okay.
It's fairly easy kind of going guy.

175
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,450
And he was like,
yeah,

176
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,230
sure,
I'll try it.

177
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,230
And so he did that one and then he did 
another one and then he did another one.

178
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,300
And by the time I met him,
he'd,

179
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,190
he'd left the monastery.
He was never a monk,

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,470
so he was in that,
you know,

181
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,060
he went through that process,
but he did it as a lay person.

182
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,650
And,
um,

183
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,483
by the time I met him,
he was in Moscow and that was my main 

184
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,710
kind of reason for going out to Moscow 
to meet him and train with him.

185
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,500
And you wanted to meet him?
I really want it.

186
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,890
Why did you want to,
I just met the,

187
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,910
the Abbot of the monastery in Scotland.
I'd gone back there and,

188
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,803
um,
a friend invite me along and I remember 

189
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,330
just seeing the picture of this guy,
you know,

190
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:30,020
and it said that he was at the Moscow 
kind of center and there was just,

191
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,320
there was something about him which 
resonated.

192
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,870
And I felt really strongly that there 
was,

193
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,310
there was something for me to,
to better understand and learn.

194
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,030
And because he'd gone through that 
journey,

195
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,580
he'd come to as a westerner,
he'd gone through,

196
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,340
he'd kind of,
my understanding of it is,

197
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:50,010
is that he'd sort of transcended the,
the,

198
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:50,844
the tradition.
So he was no longer kind of stuck with 

199
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,310
the words and the concept and the 
frameworks.

200
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,230
And so he kind of operated outside of 
that,

201
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:03,231
which allowed him to communicate in a 
way which just struck a chord,

202
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,163
which I'd never really kind of 
experienced before because I'd always 

203
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,950
been in foreign monasteries where it 
was,

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,230
you know,
this is how it is and it's like this.

205
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,064
And always the same language was used.
And so he kind of cut through that for 

206
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,320
me and helped me see in a,
in a really different way.

207
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,213
I think that somehow you in,
that's obviously significant as you go 

208
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,604
on along with your partner and your team
to become the founder of headspace that 

209
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:28,821
are significant men or for you with 
someone that didn't use the conventional

210
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,950
traditional lexicon by in fact 
colloquially taught,

211
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,173
taught meditation,
which is precisely what headspace does 

212
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,900
now for 20 million users.

213
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,060
So I can see why he would be a 
significant figure,

214
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,490
but it also seems significant to me,
Andy,

215
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,650
that the,
uh,

216
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,780
impulse to connect with this guy seem 
very intuitive,

217
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,000
very instinctive.
What's that about do you think?

218
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,670
Yeah,
yeah.

219
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,060
I think maybe I'm just kind of rash.
I tend,

220
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,660
I tend to kind of move from instinct I 
would say or you know,

221
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,450
I,
I tend not to over overthink things.

222
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,284
So whether it was kind of going away and
becoming a monk and that felt like just 

223
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,140
so intuitively the right thing to do.
Um,

224
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,030
I did it in the same did you did,
what was that?

225
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,210
I mean from Bristol in England,
aren't ya?

226
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,190
You're just a bloke from Bristol in 
England,

227
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,830
that's suddenly you're a monk in the 
Himalayas,

228
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,330
then you're,
there's a bit where you're nearly in the

229
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,400
center.
Cause my mate Gareth,

230
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,323
which uses the shower,
his biography sounds like a lie that 

231
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,840
you'd make up to impress a girl for a 
while.

232
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,360
Then I was in the circus then I was a 
necessity in for a couple of weeks.

233
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,890
They removed that part.

234
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,130
Kevin Keegan Mad Celtic life.
He sounds,

235
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,990
it does sound bizarre.
I think if you,

236
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,900
if you look at it as a,
um,

237
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,530
there's no way of explaining away the 
monk to circus monk the clown bit.

238
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,360
But um,
basically until the age of 21,

239
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,080
I competed in gymnastics.
So kind of,

240
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:55,914
I had the acrobatic kind of background.
I then went to become a monk and for 10 

241
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:02,140
years I didn't know exercise and that 
was something that I really,

242
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,140
really missed.
So as soon as I had the opportunity,

243
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,940
you can't,
you can't exercise as a monk.

244
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,700
So as soon as I finished being a monk,
why,

245
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,870
why can't,
why he's meditating all day?

246
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,130
That's it.
Just sitting around,

247
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,800
sitting around with your eyes closed,
not doing anything.

248
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,283
Exactly.
So and I was desperate to kind of go 

249
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:20,360
back and do,
do that.

250
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,730
So that was the first thing I did when I
stopped being a monk.

251
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
And so yeah.
And so you know,

252
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,474
I went back to do an acrobatics and 
stuff and I transitioned a bit of 

253
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,250
extremists mate,
one minute,

254
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,913
next minute year moncton and going to be
in a circus now it sounds like that 

255
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,893
focus and concentration,
one of the things he seems like he must 

256
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:38,684
have and also as a,
as I say when I listened to you on 

257
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:44,420
headspace interest in tea,
you say other stuff like it's a like you

258
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,254
must have a good relationship with your 
inner life concentration and focus for 

259
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,720
an acrobat concentration and focus for 
gymnasts,

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,880
concentration,
focus and aspect might say of uh,

261
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,773
of meditation.
So you're you but you pursued the 

262
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,910
monastic path.
Yeah,

263
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,783
we briefly spoke upstairs and like 
monastic life is determined by a 

264
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,710
structure,
isn't it?

265
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,544
You get up at a certain time,
you eat certain things and evidently 

266
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,160
you're not allowed to do any bloody 
size.

267
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,270
So like how long did you live that life?
So I lived there on and off.

268
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,280
So I started as a,
as a lay person,

269
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,350
um,
uh,

270
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,400
in,
in northern India.

271
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,050
And then so I went,
became a novice monk,

272
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,420
so I moved to,
uh,

273
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,530
moved to Burma.
Um,

274
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,070
and then I went and went on to become a 
monk in Tibet.

275
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,070
Introducers over a period of,
of 10 of 10 years.

276
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,993
And these transitions,
are they marked by Sarah many and 

277
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,300
commitment?
What are these transitions?

278
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:40,690
How would I mark [inaudible] some are,
yeah.

279
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,524
I think when you become a novice monk 
there's a ceremony and I think it 

280
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:47,110
becomes a bit more formal as you become 
a fully ordained monk.

281
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:47,944
So it was,
I didn't bring the pictures are 

282
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:52,240
upstairs,
but I'm definitely going to look,

283
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,180
you've got shaved that now.
I mean it's different.

284
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,103
I mean did you look,
cause when I first met you it just then 

285
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,231
like,
oh yeah,

286
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,300
he's a monk back are sort of like,
you know,

287
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,200
people that got a vibe.

288
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,450
Like I've tried to lighten it up.
Cause you knew though,

289
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,670
cause he knew I used to be probably,
yeah.

290
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Probably there was confirmation bias,
but also also there was the sense I I me

291
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:13,384
my background in addiction,
you sense when people have like we have 

292
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,014
drug addicts,
they're not present like well whatever 

293
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,603
type of drug it is,
there think mostly their life when 

294
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:21,874
they're not taking drugs is just the 
thing that they have to deal with in 

295
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,230
order to get back to drugs.
Now we have spiritual meditation.

296
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:31,231
People I impact it has on me is it makes
me vibrate a bit or I don't know,

297
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,710
I like,
it keeps me up.

298
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,090
I something about it.
I like,

299
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:36,920
and I remember when I was a little kid 
that we're not looking at us 25 seven so

300
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,570
when I was 27 I met this gaze there.
That was a sort of hardcore swami rather

301
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,670
not swamis from the Harry Krishna sect.

302
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,503
Right.
And when I met him it was like I got a 

303
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,830
real buzz off it.
It was like a meat and a beautiful woman

304
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:48,561
actually.
It was like,

305
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,450
I was like,
Oh God,

306
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,850
I really want to impress him.
I like him a lot of goal.

307
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,470
It so exciting.
And I recognize,

308
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,780
and then when you read autobiography of 
a Yogi,

309
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,420
I'm like,
when Yogananda talks about his guru,

310
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,250
his great love,
great passion.

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,250
So yeah,
I mean if I think,

312
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,440
you know,
you talking just now about kind of gurus

313
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,020
and stuff and I'll start off with 
teaching.

314
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,260
If I think about sort of the first time 
I met who I would consider to be sort of

315
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,480
like guru type sort of status.
Is that that Irish it Donald?

316
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,421
No,
it's not.

317
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:20,110
It's um,
it's a chap called his holiness the come

318
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,520
up and who escaped from Tibet,
um,

319
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,580
when he was 17 years old because of what
Chinese occupation and I met him back in

320
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,053
a,
those are quite serious threat to his 

321
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:31,780
life.

322
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,360
So I met him,
um,

323
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,061
back,
I don't know,

324
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:36,040
late 1990,
something like that.

325
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,280
And I remember the f even I knew nothing
about him.

326
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,263
And the first time I met him,
I can own only described that moment as 

327
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,960
completely limitless in nature.
And whether you define limitless bye,

328
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,780
bye love,
bye space.

329
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:57,230
By time there was a feeling of 
connection,

330
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,550
which I had never experienced up until 
that kind of point.

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,050
And it was without any of the kind of,
as I say that the baggage of association

332
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:06,884
or anything else.
I didn't really kind of know much about 

333
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:08,930
him.
He was 17 year old,

334
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,050
17 years old.
So he was like a kid.

335
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,010
He was a kid,
he could,

336
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,873
he was 17,
but he could have been 80 or 90 years 

337
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,544
old.
There was something about him which was 

338
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,000
completely timeless,
ageless.

339
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,403
And that for me was the beginning of a 
very different kind of journey into 

340
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,340
meditation.

341
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,660
I would say.
What happened to you in retrospect?

342
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,770
I think,
um,

343
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,020
I mean it shattered a lot of kind of 
illusions I might have had,

344
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,540
but it also was the beginning of,
um,

345
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,270
sort of,
I guess a journey of devotion as well.

346
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,930
And I think devotion is often kind of 
talked about in,

347
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,110
in different different ways.
I'm not talking about a blind devotion,

348
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,380
but a real sense of something being,
and it was personified by that person,

349
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,434
but it wasn't really about that person.
It was something kind of bigger and yet 

350
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:00,560
there was a a direction for that.
Again,

351
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,800
whether you think of his devotion or 
love or whatever there was,

352
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,660
it felt like it had a very definite sort
of direction and purpose.

353
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,120
So I felt just the connection that I'd 
never,

354
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,060
I'd never experienced before.
Inescapably Andy,

355
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,570
we are talking about quite profound 
ideas,

356
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,493
profound and powerful energies that some
wallet supersede the colloquial and 

357
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:32,141
secularized world of the headspace APP,
which I think he's a brilliant,

358
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:33,014
brilliant tool,
but part of the compromise it's 

359
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,130
continually made,
excuse me,

360
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,470
when reaching out to what we would say,
you know,

361
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,313
we would call secular people are 
nonreligious people or people that 

362
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,940
aren't spiritual,
you continually.

363
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,773
So again,
it's just a thing just to help you 

364
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,570
relax,
just making more effective at work.

365
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,853
Right?
And then how do we fit this together 

366
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,983
with this stuff that I'm kind of into,
which like seven year old kid that's 

367
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,020
like the golden child.
It's conveying some limitless,

368
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:01,190
infinite wisdom makes these person are 
irrelevant.

369
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,890
Like you sense God in someone or you 
know,

370
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:07,670
and again that's a complicated word,
but the limitless to use your term,

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,410
how do we align that with the needs of 
headspace?

372
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,250
Is it because you look at them as 
separate things or what?

373
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,550
I really don't actually.
I think it's um,

374
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,140
it's been a journey that has just kind 
of evolved and um,

375
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,003
I feel like w to suggest it's gone full 
circle suggests that something has been 

376
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,280
achieved.
And I don't mean it in that way.

377
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,143
I mean simply I've been on a journey 
where I started off with one particular 

378
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,284
kind of language in a way of kind of 
looking at the world and thinking about 

379
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,860
things I found.

380
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,610
I went through another kind of period 
where I was using different language and

381
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,740
looking at the world in a different kind
of way.

382
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,960
And then I came back to a situation 
where I'm using the old language but to,

383
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,880
to kind of refer back to that.
And for me they're not different.

384
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:55,881
And I personally,
I think the danger of kind of having any

385
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,430
kind of labels like normal people or 
spiritual people,

386
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,570
I think that is defined that the essence
is defined by being present.

387
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,883
And I think as soon as we take on the 
label of being spiritual or 

388
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:09,744
nonspiritual,
then we stepped away from the essence 

389
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,643
that we're trying to kind of describe.
So I don't feel like there's a 

390
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
difference.
There's definitely,

391
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,710
I,
you know,

392
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,020
we're talking about staff using 
different,

393
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,883
I wouldn't talk about this kind of in,
in the APP because I don't feel like 

394
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,184
it's the most helpful,
most relevant thing for the person 

395
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:29,034
coming to the APP.

396
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,220
But as we kind of,
as we kind of dig a bit deeper,

397
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,360
I think,
you know,

398
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,640
is relevant to my personal kind of 
journey.

399
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,270
Um,
and all of that informs kind of what has

400
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,140
gone into the APP.
None.

401
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,180
Nothing in the APP is not my own idea.
Nothing is kind of been invented by me.

402
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:49,680
It's really me just kind of taking,
you know,

403
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:54,600
other people's wisdom and trying to kind
of bring it together in a way that feels

404
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,310
right for people like us,
right,

405
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,080
who don't live in a monastery,
of course.

406
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes,
there is no,

407
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:03,921
it doesn't in any way undermine or 
compromise the content of the APP to say

408
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:05,994
that someone that's been a monk for 10 
years is going to have had different 

409
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,920
experiences than someone who's just 
picking up their phone and going off and

410
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,360
online 10 minutes where I'm not worrying
about my job or wherever it is.

411
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,193
You know,
that's obviously distinct is obviously 

412
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:21,450
something that you've dedicated a great 
deal of exploration toward.

413
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,510
And there's many things I'm fascinated 
about here,

414
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,840
mate,
because like when we talk about the,

415
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:28,271
uh,
the,

416
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:33,210
the devotion that is in here within a 
guru student system,

417
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,730
when you talk about the discipline and 
structures that were,

418
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,940
um,
prevalent in your monastic life,

419
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,983
it is in escapable that these models 
have been extricated from western life 

420
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,830
as we know it.
So that's a key.

421
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,930
Must be a huge challenge.
He is,

422
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,240
and I,
I,

423
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,353
you know,
if in a perfect kind of scenario like 

424
00:19:58,351 --> 00:19:59,400
maybe people,
and it's so,

425
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,243
it's interesting,
people sometimes come into the APP and 

426
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,950
they get to a point where they say,
actually,

427
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,180
I really,
you know,

428
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,350
where,
where did you train,

429
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,600
uh,
where did you do retreat?

430
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:09,434
As you kind of want to go and 
investigate kind of that a little bit 

431
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,000
more,
you know,

432
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,060
so the people who kind of follow on and 
go go down that route.

433
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,970
And so sometimes I do feel like,
yes,

434
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:18,804
there is a,
a journey that can be delivered through 

435
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,863
the APP,
but it's one part of the journey and 

436
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,780
maybe at some stage some people will 
want to go off and explore that,

437
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,790
you know,
outside of the APP as well.

438
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,141
Yes,
yes.

439
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,220
That is a,
like,

440
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,054
it's a departure point.
This is like good way of learning 

441
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,300
meditation.
Um,

442
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,583
but another one of the things that must 
be significant and it's something that 

443
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:44,700
we've touched upon already,
is the use of language.

444
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
The words don't really like,
you know,

445
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,400
we were talking before

446
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,850
andy about how as soon as you start 
talking about concepts,

447
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,550
we,
it becomes complicated.

448
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,384
It becomes complicated because you're 
dealing with something somewhat 

449
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,350
intangible.
I genuinely feel like the more,

450
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,110
the more we talk about

451
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,043
meditation,
the further we move away from the 

452
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,080
experience.
So we could just say,

453
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,270
and not say anything for now,
but at the same time,

454
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,020
like you got to say something.
And so I,

455
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:16,854
I genuinely feel like that there has to 
be some kind of conversation and it has 

456
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,420
to be signposts and has to be guidance 
as a,

457
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,680
there's an old parley kind of term.
Um,

458
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,360
and he's Kalina Mctier,
which is,

459
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,000
I believe that's from the lion king.
God,

460
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,320
God common.
Yeah.

461
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,590
I believe it's a warthog.
That's right.

462
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,730
The poly walked Paul.
And,

463
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,320
um,
so I think there's,

464
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,333
what does it mean that it means trusted 
friend or kind of like trusted guide 

465
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,210
and,
and for me that's the role that it's,

466
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,044
it's how to be kind of a rather than 
kind of laying on concepts and saying 

467
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:59,440
you should think in a certain way or you
should live in a certain

468
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,710
way,
it's more kind of,

469
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,100
okay look I went away and did this thing
and you know,

470
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,050
I find it really helpful.
Maybe I've done a little bit more than,

471
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,913
than some other people,
a little bit less than some other 

472
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,044
people,
but I'm really happy to be like a 

473
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:17,050
trusted guide into to use that 
experience and to try to find a language

474
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,423
that worked for me.
And my hope is that it works for others 

475
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,280
as well.
Definitely do.

476
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:23,750
And it really brilliantly.
That's fair.

477
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,010
Come on me.
I think you've cracked it now.

478
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,863
Like one of the great lies of our time,
it seems to me is the idea that the 

479
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,290
personal liberty is freedom and personal
liberty means that we can be who we want

480
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:40,750
to be.
But I'm starting to understand that that

481
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,420
is not the case,
that there is no such thing as a vacuum.

482
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,420
There is no such thing as a sort of an 
uninfluenced freedom.

483
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,563
What we have is I think we live in an 
extremist consumerist culture that our 

484
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,124
time is deeply influenced by ideologies,
so all pervasive that we can't see them 

485
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:59,164
because they are everything.
It'd be like trying to identify 

486
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:03,100
individual molecules of oxygen or 
whatever.

487
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,960
So like with our opposing structures,
without alternative structures,

488
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,830
our role in civilization,
our role in society,

489
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:13,150
but it comes to consume.
We consume,

490
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:15,310
we don't know how to look at the world 
differently.

491
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,800
We consume our politics,
we consume our news.

492
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,634
We have show business politicians now,
so there is a great necessity for 

493
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:28,420
spirituality to get a foothold in 
contemporary life.

494
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,670
Technology is going to be part of it.
In a way.

495
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,833
Headspace is a perfect product.
Are you surprised by the way that it's 

496
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,240
gone by the place that you found 
herself?

497
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,840
I'm not surprised the people have warm 
to the idea of practicing meditation.

498
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,280
I think it's

499
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,040
timeless.
I think is universal.

500
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,860
It's been around for thousands of years.
The need,

501
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,723
you know,
people experienced anxiety and sadness 

502
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,950
and anger back then.
You know,

503
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,880
there's in the same way that they do 
now.

504
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:02,120
I think the difference is you say now 
that it's almost like there's a bit of a

505
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,900
squeeze kind of and that we're all 
feeding now,

506
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,753
squeeze,
feeling more overwhelmed by all those 

507
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:10,310
things.
So I think yeah,

508
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,144
it's,
it's perhaps no surprise that more than 

509
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,424
ever people are looking for for that.
My only concern about it is that in the 

510
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,033
sense of urgency and need the,
it becomes in people's minds at least a 

511
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,210
a fix rather.
So it's like how,

512
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,810
how I'm feeling stressed,
how do I fix that and not sleeping?

513
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:31,430
How do I fix that?
Rather than,

514
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,443
okay,
how do I understand my life or my mind 

515
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,940
in relationship to stress or in 
relationship to sleep?

516
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,430
And that meditation is about 
understanding.

517
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,590
It's not about fixing something or 
changing something.

518
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:46,580
So I feel like that's a very delicate 
dance and balance that we're all kind of

519
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,410
engaged in state.
How,

520
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,710
how to,
on the one hand offer people the aspirin

521
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,573
because they have a headache and we 
should treat the headache and at the 

522
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:58,490
same time say wood's not about tree 
treating the symptom.

523
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:01,340
It's about looking at and understanding 
the underlying cause.

524
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,563
Is it,
does it have the potential to be 

525
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:07,820
extremely dangerous in revolutionary?
Some of these ideas in that,

526
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,683
it seems to me that the natural end 
point is it kind of throwing off the 

527
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,430
shackles of our contemporary way of 
life,

528
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:14,264
beyond even the external structures and 
perhaps more importantly the internal 

529
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:20,030
structures that make us victim to those 
external ones.

530
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,170
If I,
if people start to say,

531
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,790
well,
there's more to life than consuming,

532
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,440
there's more to life than what I do for 
a job.

533
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,550
What happens if community start forming 
around different idea?

534
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:30,770
What happens then?
Yeah,

535
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,490
I mean I think that's a really 
interesting idea.

536
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,770
You know,
and there's quite an exciting idea and I

537
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:37,604
don't think it's the differences.
I don't think it has to be this or that 

538
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,793
in,
I don't think it has to be so kind of 

539
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:44,840
extreme.
I,

540
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,090
I personally feel like it's quite 
possible to,

541
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,640
to live in the world with the world as 
it is,

542
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,953
but two at the same time to do that with
a sense of awareness and compassion and 

543
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,913
you know,
that means that we're taking 

544
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,570
responsibility for living the way that 
we choose to live.

545
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,170
And perhaps as a result,
there were some ripples from that.

546
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,990
Hopefully the other people around us 
kind of benefit from.

547
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,270
And maybe even some of those people 
might kind of think,

548
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,500
hmm,
you know what?

549
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,334
Maybe I'll do a little bit of that.
So rather than it being sort of coerce 

550
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,170
if in nature or any kind of sense of 
pushing,

551
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,004
it's more just taking responsibility for
one's own sanity and a health and 

552
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:25,570
relationships and then kind of seeing 
what happens

553
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,023
as a result.
I think you're quite right about that 

554
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:33,480
because I was thinking just as you spoke
that we are different men.

555
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,260
You and I that and the,
uh,

556
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:39,090
a monk and by nature is,
it seems that that journey is about,

557
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,520
there is some distinction,
some discretion,

558
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:42,354
some separation monastery.
Think about that sometimes when I was 

559
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,300
young,
when I met that man,

560
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,550
that man is a matter of fact.
I said,

561
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:48,384
do you think I should become a monk?
Did you think he laughed at me when I 

562
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,680
said it?
He laughed at the idea.

563
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,700
And this was,
that was then,

564
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:54,800
you know,
and,

565
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,940
but like,
I sometimes wish that I were,

566
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
I sometimes wish that there were robes 
that didn't know what my position is in 

567
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:01,340
the road.
The,

568
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,840
I don't believe in this.
This is not who I am.

569
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,700
And I don't want to talk about those 
things,

570
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,080
you know,
but like I,

571
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:07,531
but,
but,

572
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:10,770
but because I am a person that has found
flesh very,

573
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,040
very appealing and corrupting,
I've found drugs very,

574
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,180
very engaging.
I like senses.

575
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,010
I like sensuality.
I like the body.

576
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,860
So I've had to come to meditation,
Yoga,

577
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,020
spirituality with a gun to my head,
you know,

578
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,890
pretty much it's worth saying,
one,

579
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,850
I've not always been a monk.
Um,

580
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,703
so there were tight for a bit lunatic 
biography and 21 years when I wasn't 

581
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,100
monk.
And I haven't been a monk now,

582
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:39,300
right,

583
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,330
for 12 years.
And,

584
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,490
um,
you know,

585
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,101
I,
I have,

586
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:44,480
uh,
I have a wife and,

587
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:46,210
and I have kids.
And so it's,

588
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,100
it's in the same,
it might,

589
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,810
it might be different,
but in the same way,

590
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:52,660
it's not that I'm,
I'm unaffected by those things.

591
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:53,494
You know,
I was drawn to my wife because she was 

592
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:56,884
beautiful and I found her beautiful.
And so I don't know if that's what 

593
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:02,590
you're kind of talking about,
but I,

594
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:03,940
well,

595
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,790
in the,
I suppose it seems that you are,

596
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,430
when you answered that question about 
like me saying,

597
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,980
because what I see when people talk 
about spirituality,

598
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,990
I believe that like a connection to,
you know,

599
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,600
like the softly even take it,
whether it's at the extreme end of being

600
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:23,560
in a monastery somewhere in Tibet or 
listening to headspace APP,

601
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:27,730
we're talking about a true for an 
authentic relationship with this self in

602
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:29,710
inverted commerce that brings about 
peace.

603
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,960
Now for me,
there's a good deep truth in that.

604
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,840
And the more people that have access to 
that,

605
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:34,674
the truth is likely that that would have
limitless repercussions and will bring 

606
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:43,780
about a lot of change.
And I feel that,

607
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,591
uh,
your,

608
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:47,290
I agree with you andy,
that we cannot start sort of like waving

609
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,124
flags and bashing down doors and there's
nothing more ridiculous than when you 

610
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:54,220
read of conflict in Buddhist countries 
and very full of like what's going on.

611
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,260
You've missed the point I suppose.
Any religion really.

612
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,960
It's like what the believe leave.
You've missed the point.

613
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,893
Yeah.

614
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,403
I wonder about expansionism I wonder 
about evangelism because I feel that 

615
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,980
there are ideas that are need to be,
that needs to be spread.

616
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:14,650
I don't think within the limited 
conversation of contemporary politics as

617
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:15,484
solution will be found.
I think that they're just pulling 

618
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:20,150
mutations and versions of each other.
I think most people think that they were

619
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,030
experiencing a time of grotesqueness,
of,

620
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:25,040
uh,
of nostalgia,

621
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,960
ethno nationalism,
old ideas,

622
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:30,590
this weird twitching flinching dinosaur 
corpse thing with a wig on.

623
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,643
There's like a bit Kuli at time.
And I feel that precisely list solution 

624
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,270
is to get in touch with essence,
essence as you described the Andy and,

625
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,280
and I feel that,
you know,

626
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,114
like,
you know,

627
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,160
you are

628
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,993
doing this thing that's means at 20 
million people are meditating now and 

629
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,643
it's really,
it's you that's doing it and it's good 

630
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:51,334
that these good and episode and perfect 
and necessary that you are a man that 

631
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:59,830
has lived as a monk for 10 years and now
lives a lay person life.

632
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,320
Because that means that there is 
authenticity.

633
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:03,460
Because if it was me doing it,
be like,

634
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,410
hang on a minute,
this,

635
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,310
that going to have to give her for 
meditation,

636
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,870
the time is right.
You know,

637
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,090
like you're doing it with a few people 
out there doing that.

638
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,670
I bet.
I bet there are.

639
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,533
But like this is authentic and true 
foreign in spite the fact that there's 

640
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,910
like comfortable animation and it's well
put together and it's,

641
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:19,660
you know,
when I,

642
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,493
when he showed me in that room that 
you'd do the broadcast in a fire that 

643
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:23,470
he's like a chapel,
you know,

644
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,304
it's silent.

645
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,200
It's dark,
it's sacred.

646
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,160
Yeah.
And,

647
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,493
and I think like any,
any place is not defined by how it 

648
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:34,180
looks,
you know,

649
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:38,110
it's just like it's a recording studio.
But I think the feeling kind of in there

650
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:39,490
is,
um,

651
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,650
I,
I just think it's the same as anything,

652
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:42,484
right?
Like if we,

653
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,850
if we go to work in a particular kind of
space,

654
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,713
every space has its own kind of feeding 
and we don't even have to be into that 

655
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,910
sort of stuff.
You know,

656
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,070
that kind of language or vocabulary to 
even experienced that.

657
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,010
We got to one place and we experienced 
one kind of feeling.

658
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:58,600
We go to another places,
different kinds of fish.

659
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,510
Maybe we walk into a room with one 
person,

660
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,880
they're angry,
we don't even talk to them,

661
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,790
but we know that they're angry.
There's a feeling kind of in the room.

662
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,760
So this kind of stuff exists even if we 
just talk about it in,

663
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:10,900
in that sort of way.

664
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,480
So I think that's what's interesting,
that we don't necessarily have to go out

665
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,580
there and talk about it.
We can.

666
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,160
And I think it's exciting and it's good 
that some people do,

667
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:24,910
especially within some kind of realms,
but specific to meditation,

668
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,983
I feel like if each and every one of us 
takes on that responsibility to simply 

669
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:30,874
to practice,
then over time that has an exponential 

670
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,023
kind of effect because the feeling is 
such that it starts to impact the lives 

671
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,980
of the people around us.
You're right.

672
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:42,814
I think I spoke to David Lynch once 
about meditation and about potentially 

673
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,380
having confrontations with people on 
air,

674
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:51,890
like going on tv shows and thinking,
oh,

675
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:53,950
I'm going to have to advocate for 
meditation.

676
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,881
He says,
well,

677
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,730
there's no point in doing that.
Really just tell them,

678
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,390
learn to meditate and it will change.
It will change.

679
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,380
It's a practice.

680
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,300
It's something that alters your 
consciousness.

681
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,590
Suddenly.
I've become aware of that.

682
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,424
Yesterday again when I was on that TV 
set or talking to kids that are like I 

683
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,144
guess 19 years old,
his beautiful young men and I'm struck 

684
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:18,100
by how bright and brilliant and ready 
and different they seem,

685
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:18,934
and I wonder if this is some perennial 
quality of youth or young people are 

686
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,940
changing now.
If people are ready,

687
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,490
if there can be some impersonal quality 
to that,

688
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,390
uh,
God,

689
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:29,880
man,
Buddha kid,

690
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,730
then perhaps there are sort of 
meteorological spirits traveling through

691
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,230
us.
I think there's this a change,

692
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:39,100
right?
There was a shift.

693
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,670
I do think,
um,

694
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,020
and definitely,
you know,

695
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,400
we,
we work a lot with,

696
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,480
with,
you know,

697
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,180
uh,
kids and teenagers written,

698
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,570
you know,
learning meditation and,

699
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,980
and I,
I do feel like,

700
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,910
do you have,
or do you mean by that work a lot with,

701
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:53,390
so,
so going into going into schools,

702
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:57,500
developing programs for specifically,
so meditation for children,

703
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:58,334
it's,
it's in app for them to do with their 

704
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,930
parents or we've,
we've done,

705
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,690
you know,
working in schools as well,

706
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,123
um,
with the intention that it becomes part 

707
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:11,291
of the school kind of curriculum and,
and my feeling is that they have watched

708
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,680
and learned from our experiences and 
they want something different.

709
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,760
Yeah.
And there's,

710
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,860
there's a real kind of readiness and as 
you say,

711
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:22,694
like a passion about that.
And I feel like as much as people kind 

712
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:30,560
of give,
kids are really kind of tough time.

713
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,380
I actually feel that they're coming 
through.

714
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:34,214
Yes,
they're challenged by all the 

715
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,470
distractions of digital and everything 
else,

716
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:40,040
but actually feel like they're more 
altruistic in nature,

717
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:44,420
more socially minded than I've seen in a
long time.

718
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,520
Certainly our generation.
Um,

719
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,750
what do you,
uh,

720
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,340
when you're d does meditation work for 
you,

721
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:53,780
right?
You've mentioned that you're married,

722
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,614
man,
you've got kids even been through that 

723
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,684
sort of pre,
you've had quite difficult life and 

724
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:00,180
you've lost a lot of people that you've 
loved in your life.

725
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,083
I don't have,
is more difficult than anyone else's 

726
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:03,800
life,
but definitely there was some,

727
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,723
there are some key things that have 
happened that have influenced my own 

728
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,700
journey.
Does it work,

729
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,960
you know,
the spiritual life,

730
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:09,794
does it work?
Is it effective when it comes to the 

731
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:13,130
crunch,
when the pain comes,

732
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,320
when the divorce comes,
when people die,

733
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,154
when people leave you,
when you lose control of life and its 

734
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:21,020
circumstances,
do you say to people,

735
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,720
this works this way of life?
Can you,

736
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,270
can you just,
what do you mean by work?

737
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,673
Does it help with pain and misery and 
sadness and despair and loneliness and 

738
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:35,951
agony and anguish?
[inaudible]

739
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,930
my wife's listening.
Um,

740
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm not quite sure why those words.
I just mean that myself.

741
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,463
I know what you mean.
Cause the question that Gareth's 

742
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:47,511
written,
actually,

743
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,580
it's normally Garrett's here doing these
things with me.

744
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:51,170
I'm not so generous as you are.
You Go,

745
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:52,370
oh,
like Richie set up,

746
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,413
may I just take the credit,
that's my function in life is to take 

747
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,290
credit.
But like one of the questions he sort of

748
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,124
pointed out,
he goes,

749
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,163
he's seen like that me,
my way of dealing with life was I'm 

750
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,550
going to take a lot of drugs.
I'm gonna do what's,

751
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,440
you know,
I'm going to do external things.

752
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,240
I'm going to get involved in the 
material world.

753
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:10,130
Whereas evidently what you did is you 
went,

754
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:13,400
I'm going to find another way and the 
other path.

755
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,630
And,
and I did.

756
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,330
And I think,
I think he's so circumstantial.

757
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,780
I look in another,
in another town,

758
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,060
in an with another set of friends.
You know,

759
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,103
I just think it was so for all of us,
it's so specific to that time in that 

760
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:30,020
place,
in that environment.

761
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,820
Um,
yes,

762
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,680
kind of.
I'd had meditation in my background,

763
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:34,514
you know,
like I'd grown up kind of doing it and 

764
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,710
stuff and my mom.
And so that was,

765
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:40,260
that was in the background.
But definitely to begin with,

766
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,460
I think,
you know,

767
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,720
my immediate reaction was one to go to 
the pub with everyone else,

768
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,250
you know,
and then kind of,

769
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,143
I probably spent a few years of doing 
that and not really seeing a shift in 

770
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,490
how I felt,
you know?

771
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:54,324
So I went away and it became a student 
and did all the things that students do 

772
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,144
and it was great fun.
But I never felt that I had any kind of 

773
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,630
liberation beyond the,
the sense of,

774
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,703
you know,
temporary freedom that I might have had 

775
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:06,750
for a few hours on,
on,

776
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,270
on a nighttime.
The next day you wake up.

777
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:13,590
And so I never felt that deep sense of 
fulfillment that I felt was possible

778
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,700
straight away.
Yeah.

779
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:15,690
Fill that.
And then I went,

780
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,520
you bet at the time,
moment of reflection ever happening.

781
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,550
Well,
mine was maybe less extreme.

782
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,580
Just kill that moment of reflection.
That guy's got to go.

783
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,470
Yeah,
maybe I was,

784
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,600
I dunno.
Do you get angry still?

785
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,860
Do you get angry?
Of course.

786
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,900
What happens?
What do you do if you feel angry?

787
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,960
Um,
I mean I,

788
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,260
I tend not to run around kind of ranting
and raving at people.

789
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,390
I don't think it,
it manifests like that,

790
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,224
but you know,
I have a three and a half year old son 

791
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,180
and an eight month old baby and we don't
sleep very much in the house.

792
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:53,620
So it's kind of inevitable at some stage
that that anger kind of comes up.

793
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,790
And as much as as possible,
it's,

794
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,020
it's trying to bring the practice to 
life,

795
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:01,210
which is to,
is to witness it and not,

796
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,640
not to become the anger,
but to,

797
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,040
to notice the anger is,
is kind of present.

798
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,350
And sometimes I miss it.
Um,

799
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,333
you know,
as in I don't see it straight away and 

800
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,540
so I'm already kind of on my son go,
Yep,

801
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,200
why don't you just do it?
That's anger.

802
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,610
Okay.
Sometimes you might want to jump off one

803
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:25,180
of those policy and cars and they'll 
just remember are the side of the road.

804
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,231
Right?
Yeah.

805
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:26,910
Yeah.
Cause that's,

806
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,890
that's what I like thinking about it.
When we came without care,

807
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,470
me and my wife were like the first 
couple of nights the baby's jet,

808
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,403
we're jet lagged and I still got,
I remember it being like four or five 

809
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:37,950
o'clock in the morning and just go,
look,

810
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,620
we're going to have disease.
How can cause this depression?

811
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,100
I think this is wrong.
No it's no manipulation.

812
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,360
And my wife went and had lunch with jet 
lag.

813
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,610
Yeah.
Like cause me,

814
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:46,444
I think I attached very quickly to 
phenomena and states of mind so that I 

815
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,500
need meditation.
I need to be able to go,

816
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,320
oh okay this is just,
you are not this feeling of anger.

817
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,303
You are not this fear.
The fear will pass and you will be 

818
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:01,114
present now.
Like I still feel like even though it's 

819
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,380
15 years since I've taken drugs or 
drunk,

820
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,460
I still feel like I'm subjective fear in
a very powerful way.

821
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,294
Like I can be hit with fear that demands
activity is like I've gotten to have to 

822
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,130
do something.
I'm feeling this feeling right.

823
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:16,360
Smashing everything up,
run,

824
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,720
you know.
And I like,

825
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,290
so it's very hard to just,
okay,

826
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,440
just breathe in.
So,

827
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:24,610
but you're saying because the meditate,
the meditative practice that you have,

828
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,590
and of course yours is a very 
particular,

829
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,593
um,
Fara version actually is applicable in 

830
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,590
situations where the free,
you know,

831
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,940
if you're all just kicking off or,
yeah.

832
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,070
I,
I actually think any meditation

833
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,320
practice which isn't applicable to daily
life,

834
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,830
uh,
yeah,

835
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,683
I kind of wonder what's the point a 
little bit because I don't think any of 

836
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:44,140
us,
you know,

837
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,680
it's not applicable in daily life,
but fucking exactly.

838
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,800
So people sit for 10 minutes and do the 
meditate.

839
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,870
What about the other 23 hours and 50 
minutes in the day?

840
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,290
So I feel like there has to be a way of 
bringing that.

841
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,153
I just see it as if we can remove 
ourselves from the madness of our lives 

842
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:05,530
for long enough to get familiar with 
what it means to be present,

843
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,830
what it means to be open and curious and
loving,

844
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:09,664
compassionate,
then we can start to bring those 

845
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:15,550
qualities back into our everyday life.
And it's an ongoing kind of training.

846
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:15,991
And,
and I,

847
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:18,220
I love that back and forth,
you know,

848
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,660
where you know,
you know it's,

849
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,980
Oh wow.
Actually yeah,

850
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,210
that's still kind of happens.
Okay.

851
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:25,120
You go back to meditation and,
and over time that kind of,

852
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,600
it strengthens where meditation is no 
longer separate from your life.

853
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,853
Meditation is simply a time within your 
life or within your day when you pause 

854
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,823
and close your eyes.

855
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,403
That's makes sense.
This thing I've been thinking about 

856
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:38,564
lately,
like the relationship between the word 

857
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:40,484
whole and the word holy,
that there is a sort of becomes an 

858
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,024
identifiable wholeness to your life.
Meaning that if I'm out on my own and I 

859
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:50,220
feel like,
uh,

860
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,600
an attractive person pays me attention,
I don't think,

861
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,280
oh brilliant.
I'm just this guy now.

862
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:55,701
I don't,
no,

863
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:56,211
no,
no.

864
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm the guy that's got the wife and the 
child.

865
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,790
You are always that you are a complete 
person.

866
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,500
You don't compartmentalize yourself off 
into me,

867
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:05,334
Oh,
in this corner of my life I get away 

868
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,990
with this.
This is the corner of my life where I do

869
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:10,370
that.
And then what is one thing?

870
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,260
There was one thing,
they were completeness.

871
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,500
And you think the meditation creates 
some sort of connections and foundations

872
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,630
and essence?
Yeah,

873
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,010
no,
no question.

874
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:19,701
You know,
we were,

875
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:20,990
we were chatting about this,
um,

876
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,330
you met ash just before we came here and
I'll,

877
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,600
I'll buddy,
he's a lovely,

878
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:27,830
lovely guy.
And you know,

879
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:32,831
we grew up together and we were just 
chatting kind of about this idea of um,

880
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,133
and,
and he was saying kind of when did you 

881
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:38,130
first kind of really feel that,
you know,

882
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:38,640
and,
and I,

883
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,660
I still,
I still remember kind of being in,

884
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,020
in the monastery and something kind of 
just melting away where I no longer felt

885
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,630
that extreme sense of self,
a sense.

886
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:53,920
And again,
I'm not suggesting for a moment that,

887
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
you know,
enlightenment or anything like this,

888
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:56,634
but just a glimpse perhaps of of what it
meant not to feel kind of isolated or 

889
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,760
separate from the world.
And in that,

890
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,373
in that moment there wasn't,
there wasn't a person to be separate 

891
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:11,754
from every,
there was only hole and there wasn't 

892
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:16,040
even any one there to,
to experience and to think about it.

893
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:16,874
Is this the whole or is it not?
There's simply that was all that 

894
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:20,900
existed.
Oh,

895
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,701
wicked.
And,

896
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:22,534
and I,
I feel like that was a low is it's just 

897
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:28,500
an experience in those come and go.

898
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,333
And it all depends on how stable those 
experiences are and how much can they 

899
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:34,280
become a part of our lives.
For me it was quite temporary,

900
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,114
but I do feel like there was,
there was something kind of in that 

901
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:42,320
which really spoke to a different way of
viewing the world.

902
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,020
You see Buddha and Jesus and that kid 
you,

903
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,380
that 17 year old God man,
you met them catch.

904
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,800
Do you think they're living there?
You think that there's in that state all

905
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,900
the time?
It seems to be,

906
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,700
you know,
it,

907
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,401
it,
there was,

908
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,650
um,
there's one other fight if I,

909
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,543
if I can.
So it was another monastery that I went 

910
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:00,411
to,
to visit.

911
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,244
So there are this,
there's this a monastery for a second 

912
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,030
pretty much monastery and monitoring.
Oh,

913
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,873
want to transcend,
you've had enough transcendent to get 

914
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:12,680
out,
go back to your wife,

915
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,750
monastery,
Gulf.

916
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,643
It was,
um,

917
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,700
there was,
um,

918
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,810
there's a kind of an elite troop of kind
of meditators,

919
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:21,830
right?
So they,

920
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,683
um,
within this tradition they get picked 

921
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,420
out the cad you school,
um,

922
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,240
of,
so there were four main ones in Tibet.

923
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,800
Cadre was one of the four.
What's that alarm or he's a good look.

924
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,000
Um,
and he's,

925
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,863
he's very well known obviously because 
of his just transcendent wisdom and 

926
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,430
compassion.
But he's also,

927
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:43,070
he was also the head of government for a
long time and sort of,

928
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,290
although he's not the head of all four 
schools,

929
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,124
he's kind of,
he's probably better known in the West 

930
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,630
than anyone else.
And in this monastery,

931
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,340
um,
they,

932
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,173
they,
they pull the kids out pretty young and 

933
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,310
obviously the kids have to want to do 
it.

934
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,310
They have to,
and they have to show a real kind of,

935
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,530
um,
what's the word?

936
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,363
Like a lot of potential in meditation.
The families have to be on board as 

937
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:05,504
well,
and they're picked out and from about 

938
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,980
the age of 10 or 11 they're in strict 
retreat.

939
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,940
They never go outside,
they never see anyone speak to anyone or

940
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:14,774
anything.
And we were invited to this monastery 

941
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,713
and it's very,
very rare to meet anyone from that 

942
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,650
thing.
And then the guy who ran it was,

943
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,280
he lived above the monastery and I was 
with this chap,

944
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,370
Donald,
and I think because I was with this chap

945
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,213
donal,
we were invited to go and see him and 

946
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,900
going into that room,
I went in there,

947
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,650
there were four of us that went in 
again,

948
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,513
that that is someone I would say who was
absolutely living that sense of 

949
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:42,974
wholeness in,
I don't believe there was an ounce of 

950
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,020
separation kind of left in him.

951
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,090
He was there,
but he wasn't there.

952
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,193
It was,
there was nothing but a presence of 

953
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,120
again,
awareness,

954
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:56,960
compassion,
openness,

955
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:57,794
love,
whatever you want to kind of call it or 

956
00:43:58,371 --> 00:43:59,990
define it.
There was,

957
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,850
there was someone there,
but there was nobody there.

958
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,950
Yeah.
And I felt like he was,

959
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,930
he had completely transcended itself.
So that that was his existence.

960
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,260
It's like the realization that your 
biographical identity and your primer,

961
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,680
you're sort of primal motivations,
your last a jealousy,

962
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:23,270
fear or even personal love,
our temporal interpretations.

963
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:26,090
And if your identification with the 
interpreter,

964
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,210
the witness,
the experience becomes your base,

965
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,920
your essence,
then there is freedom

966
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,500
because curiously it's a colloquialism 
again.

967
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,334
After I met that Geezer adding that 
Swami and I went to my mate Matt 

968
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,940
Huskies,
it's weird.

969
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,100
Right?
And it goes,

970
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:41,934
I couldn't imagine there's anything you 
could say to him that would knock him 

971
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,410
off.
He said like,

972
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,130
yeah,
like,

973
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,220
and my mate went like,
yeah,

974
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:49,830
what if you went might as some skin,
it's fucking up your car.

975
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,833
Whoa.
I wouldn't like there's nothing you 

976
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,360
could say or like,
do you want to be in our band?

977
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,860
He wouldn't go all right.
Yeah.

978
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,610
They're like,
you're,

979
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,040
there's nothing.
There is nothing to get,

980
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,750
there is nothing to lose.
Yeah.

981
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,700
Hmm.
So yeah,

982
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:07,020
I'm really into it.
The other thing is though with Amma,

983
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:07,854
the hugging saint who I also feel like 
she emanates great wisdom and I'd have 

984
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,770
followers think,
but you know,

985
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:16,590
they're very in like that Hindu as you 
know better than me.

986
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,453
Like they're much more idolatry based.
So they're saying this woman is an 

987
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:22,820
incarnation of carly or some,
you know,

988
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:23,654
they say she's got,
yeah now like I was watching her and 

989
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:31,080
she's amazing and powerful and visibly 
going into China,

990
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:33,750
send an states and stuff like that.
But there's this big night,

991
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:35,910
right?
It was New Year's eve and I have 10,000

992
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,500
followers hanging out and like,
you know,

993
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:43,240
sort of his big party and chanting.
It was cool and she's up,

994
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,880
you know,
enthroned and stuff.

995
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,773
There's a bit where someone,
a musician like messed up something and 

996
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:50,310
I've actually just been always sought 
out,

997
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:51,144
finger out,
like in whatever southern Indian 

998
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,574
language she speaks.
She went and sought sorta thing out of 

999
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,173
all,
she's still interacting with the 

1000
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,650
material world.
Here's why one though.

1001
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,540
And they sort of say in Christianity and
Christ says like,

1002
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,800
you know,
in the world,

1003
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,070
but not of it.
Yeah.

1004
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,360
You,
what do you feel about perennialism?

1005
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:12,350
What do you feel about identifiable,
uh,

1006
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,580
truths that are appear in many,
if not all spiritual traditions.

1007
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,210
I also,

1008
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,780
again,
I think that the more that we,

1009
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,660
the more that we rely on words and 
concepts,

1010
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,300
the further we move away from truth.
So the,

1011
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,530
the challenge always I think with these 
great teachers is that there's always an

1012
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:36,940
essence there.
And there's,

1013
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,013
you know,
it's often talked about is sort of 

1014
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:40,744
mystical schools,
but I just think there's an essence and 

1015
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:46,150
the essence is to be,
is awareness and compassion for what,

1016
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:49,810
I can't find other other words but that 
it's called by many names,

1017
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,340
but you know,
for the,

1018
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,293
for the sake of this,
it's called at call it that I feel like 

1019
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,980
that's at the heart of every,
every lineage,

1020
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,720
every tradition,
every faith,

1021
00:46:58,721 --> 00:47:03,721
every tradition.
And I just feel that the further it kind

1022
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:07,030
of moves outwards and as it moves out 
into society,

1023
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,420
the less and less it has to do with the 
essence.

1024
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,210
And the more and more it has to do with 
a structure,

1025
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,860
often a structure reliant on,
you know,

1026
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:16,694
the power and government and all kinds 
of other kind of factors that start to 

1027
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,044
play into it.
So all of a sudden like the essence is 

1028
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:24,220
lost.
And so people are doing things and going

1029
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:25,054
through the motions of things and not 
even really kind of necessarily knowing 

1030
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,523
what they're doing or why they're doing 
or even having the benefit of 

1031
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,080
experiencing the essence of that kind of
practice.

1032
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:35,914
So,
and let us obviously kind of very 

1033
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,150
general and broad and it's not true in 
every case,

1034
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:41,560
but I,
I see it a lot.

1035
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,510
Um,
and I've,

1036
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,460
I saw in Asian countries as well,
he'll often,

1037
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:46,294
this is,
you know,

1038
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,860
in the west,
we like this in the east at,

1039
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,040
I mean I saw that in just as much in 
Asian countries as I did in,

1040
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,760
in the west.

1041
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,910
And even in your monastic experience,
you said,

1042
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:56,350
you know,
there's gap at this time,

1043
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,530
eat this.
But when we discussed it before,

1044
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:00,700
it was more like,
look,

1045
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,140
let's eliminate as much as possible all 
the Ephemera of everyday affairs.

1046
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,900
So you can focus on awareness and 
compassion.

1047
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,940
Cultivate in these qualities.
Yeah.

1048
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,883
But that itself is a form of structure,
but it is in evidence that we go from 

1049
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:18,370
Christ,
the idea of Christ,

1050
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:19,204
of like,
you know,

1051
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,310
abandoned your possessions and follow 
me.

1052
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,890
Don't get caught up in material world,
loves everything.

1053
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:27,100
Don't judge nobody to write.
I'm going to need cathedrals.

1054
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,690
Yeah.
Like it's a sort of,

1055
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,390
it becomes materialized,
institutionalized.

1056
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:33,610
And that is not about this essence is 
it?

1057
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,720
No.
And that's what I,

1058
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,150
that's what really moved me and look is,
is,

1059
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,120
is absolutely the same in,
in all mystical schools,

1060
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:42,970
whether it's Christianity or Sufism of 
Islam.

1061
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,880
Like you can find it in many in all the 
great traditions.

1062
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,390
But what really inspired me,
you know,

1063
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:51,610
with the,
the great yogis of Tibet,

1064
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:52,444
you know,
they,

1065
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,270
they issued all that stuff.
They didn't want anything to do with any

1066
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:56,770
kind of,
not even the monasteries.

1067
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,300
They would just go to a cave in the 
mountains and they break it up and,

1068
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,313
and they'd have a little hole in one 
corner where they pass their waste out 

1069
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:05,464
of.
They'd have a little hole in the other 

1070
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:06,694
corner where someone would come along 
every now and again and put some food 

1071
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:11,620
inside and they would live their lives 
there and it was,

1072
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,490
it was free from all that kind of other 
stuff.

1073
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,510
And whilst on the one hand it's,
it's not very kind of practical.

1074
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,123
I think on the other hand it created an 
environment where the focus and the 

1075
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:25,414
intention was on the essence and the 
cultivation of the essence and the 

1076
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:29,224
continuance of the essence through the 
ages rather than trying to create these 

1077
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:33,604
greatest establishments that maybe kind 
of didn't necessarily kind of have to 

1078
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,060
focus and intention on the,
on the essence,

1079
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,933
no,
their social structures and social 

1080
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:46,630
structures tend to,
the magnetism seems to be towards power.

1081
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,693
We talked before about polarity and 
concepts such as positive and negative 

1082
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,090
and even these you issue the evening 
these,

1083
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,820
well I think from a meditation point of 
view they're,

1084
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,713
they're really challenging.
So most of us will have a relationship 

1085
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:01,504
with the mind where we kind of all with 
thoughts where we see some thoughts as 

1086
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,400
positive and we see some thoughts as 
negative.

1087
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,743
So in doing that,
we've already created a framework for 

1088
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:10,834
tension and stress.
If you know of positive thoughts come 

1089
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:14,590
up,
we want to hold onto them or you want to

1090
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:17,560
chase after them and if they look like 
they're going away,

1091
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:18,394
we get a little bit kind of nervous or 
we desire them so much that we chase 

1092
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:23,080
after them.
So we're caught up in that.

1093
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,450
If a negative thought comes up,
we don't like it,

1094
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,970
we maybe we experience fear or were very
resistant to it.

1095
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,890
So we then kind of pushing against the 
thought.

1096
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,860
But when we then you'll know,
you know,

1097
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:35,780
I'm sure you know this from your own 
meditation or when you,

1098
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,060
when you step back just a little bit,
you know,

1099
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,000
a thought is a thought and if we don't 
engage with it,

1100
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,340
if we're able to kind of maintain that 
place,

1101
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,970
that seat of awareness where we simply 
witness a thought coming and going,

1102
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,010
it's a thought.
It's neither good nor bad.

1103
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,063
It only becomes good or bad.
Once we start to think about it in a 

1104
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,054
certain way and once we start to have a 
relationship with it and to engage with 

1105
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:59,600
it and to create a storyline around it,
then it becomes problematic.

1106
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,520
But I thought in and of itself is 
neither is neither positive or negative

1107
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,810
in a way for is the first layer of the 
material world.

1108
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,760
It's an object.
Yeah.

1109
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,841
I I,
yeah,

1110
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:15,100
I think that some,
I mean there's always different ways of,

1111
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,660
of looking at it,
but I feel like that's the first,

1112
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,120
the first,
uh,

1113
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,983
normally the first place where we kind 
of get a bit caught up and where we 

1114
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,590
start to experience suffering and stress
in our life.

1115
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,710
Because even though like I've been 
meditating in seven years,

1116
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:34,600
transcendental meditation,
I been listening to headspace and like,

1117
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:36,040
you know,
I'm listening to the beginners bit,

1118
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,360
right?
Cause it's free.

1119
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,400
I thought I Weiss of so odds but credit 
card number into something like,

1120
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,380
Oh God,
no,

1121
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,630
this feels like a real commitment.
But like,

1122
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,780
but like so,
so,

1123
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,170
but even though like when I'm listening 
and then 10 minute ones,

1124
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:47,741
I'm like,
bloody hell,

1125
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:49,830
this is for proper beginners,
like Lard,

1126
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,673
recommend to mates and mine are out 
lights did in driveways and that guy 

1127
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:54,281
look,
listen to this,

1128
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,840
this will be of your meditation.
But me,

1129
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:58,360
I've been meditating all this time and I
still like,

1130
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:01,030
you know that right.
You probably maybe wandered off now just

1131
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:01,864
returned back to the awareness of the 
rising and falling Nebraska and bloody 

1132
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:04,750
oh,
I am just saying yeah.

1133
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,860
Thinking again.
Yeah.

1134
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,050
You know,
he's sort of like,

1135
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:11,770
it's being stylish in this habit of the 
mind.

1136
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,270
Yeah.
It's incredible,

1137
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:18,271
right?
It's so ingrained and there's does this,

1138
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:21,190
um,
sometimes this idea that,

1139
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,410
you know,
your friends will say,

1140
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,170
oh,
or people who meditate was how yeah,

1141
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:26,230
you went away and he did it for kind of 
so low,

1142
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,460
so low.
We'll kind of,

1143
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,433
so what in a way it does,
it doesn't mean that I no longer 

1144
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,640
experience distraction of the mind.
I think it,

1145
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,493
it is a practice and I,
I really believe that none of us really 

1146
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,800
kind of mastered is that maybe the odd 
few people like you know,

1147
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,330
people we've been chatting about today,
but I feel like it is a,

1148
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,183
is a lifelong practice.
He said journey for life and we're all 

1149
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:47,854
students.
We are always a student and if we ever 

1150
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:50,344
lose that sense of not being a student,
then we've lost that sense of freshness 

1151
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:57,310
and curiosity and openness and 
beginner's mind,

1152
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:00,130
which I feel is so important in 
meditation.

1153
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:02,470
If we're not turning up with that,
then it's just a routine.

1154
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,910
We just kind of going through the motion

1155
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,230
assignment,
think about little kids be in,

1156
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:07,230
you know,
taken off right there.

1157
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,110
Maybe seven years old,
they're 11 years old.

1158
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:09,944
It just seems extraordinary as a person 
who's grown up in the culture at I have 

1159
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,360
that.
That would even be an option.

1160
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,111
But I suppose,
yeah,

1161
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:15,944
you think about it with football,
you'd take off a six year old trough in 

1162
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:18,864
some football academy,
but the idea that you would an 11 year 

1163
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:21,974
old would be capable of that and it 
shows you how much cultural experiences 

1164
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,360
in the world knowable to,
I think candy,

1165
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:28,194
that fear and desire,
the constant triggers to action are so 

1166
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:33,684
prevalent culturally that the news is 
promoting fear that commerce if rounds 

1167
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,203
on desire,
but these animalistic states a 

1168
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,960
perpetuated that we need,
uh,

1169
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,580
in,
uh,

1170
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,190
an alternative if not oppositional force
an ideology because the Po,

1171
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,320
the,
the,

1172
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,480
the magnetism is powerful.
The magnetism,

1173
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,400
the alternative is powerful.
Yeah.

1174
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,590
I guess it depends how we,

1175
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,670
and again,
different viewpoints on it,

1176
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:04,360
but how we approached that.
So if there's one idea,

1177
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:07,810
do we try and,
do we try?

1178
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,940
I think very often you'll see one idea 
and you,

1179
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:12,040
she's in a,
in American politics right now,

1180
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,113
there's one idea presented and then the 
other side they just shout a little bit 

1181
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:18,190
kind of louder and then this side shouts
louder.

1182
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,410
And then this side til eventually the 
kind of,

1183
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:20,790
you know,
there's,

1184
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,850
there's so much kind of conflict and I 
guess there's a,

1185
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:27,420
there are different ways of coming at it
and,

1186
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,490
and arguably the way of creating that 
alternative kind of route is rather than

1187
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,730
by trying to overthrow that in a kind of
a,

1188
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,573
a physical or energetic kind of way,
more kind of not engaging paps and 

1189
00:54:42,551 --> 00:54:45,400
creating an environment where that can't
exist now.

1190
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:48,670
Because if all of us are,
are living an open,

1191
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,400
present,
compassionate kind of life,

1192
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,920
no one's going to vote for that.
Yes.

1193
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,830
You know,
so we,

1194
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:56,290
we enable,
you know,

1195
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:59,260
I feel like the society enables that 
behavior.

1196
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,080
It doesn't necessarily,
it's not necessarily,

1197
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:05,890
we're not necessarily slaves to it.
We all kind of part of that and each and

1198
00:55:05,891 --> 00:55:09,130
every one of us has a responsibility to 
sort of,

1199
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:09,880
you know,
to,

1200
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,310
to be more present perhaps and not 
engage in it.

1201
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,303
I think that's beautiful.
I've heard that I did from various 

1202
00:55:16,701 --> 00:55:19,480
different sources,
even quite,

1203
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,400
you know,
anarchists and quite political people,

1204
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,770
right.
People that are sort of progressive,

1205
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,643
uh,
[inaudible] ideas of setting up 

1206
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:28,844
societies that are independent,
saying that don't engage in opposition 

1207
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:36,740
Ism simply establish alternatives,
established alternatives and living it.

1208
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,603
And when I think about them,
two boys that was talking to yesterday 

1209
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,250
were young men.
Yeah.

1210
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,163
Like I think yeah,
they are not going to want to like if 

1211
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,860
you give them that right,
here is a system.

1212
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:46,694
He was an alternative system.
Like the way we can live in the world 

1213
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:52,700
and we admit that the NAC is a woven 
material in it with consuming in it.

1214
00:55:52,701 --> 00:55:54,760
We've where we acumen and we're frail 
and we we're flawed.

1215
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,340
Yeah.
It doesn't,

1216
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,610
we don't have to live in the extremist 
state that are currently being offered.

1217
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,150
Even see that inside our own mind.
Right.

1218
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,043
That we almost fanned the flames when we
provide a lot of opposition or a lot of 

1219
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:08,320
conflict.
Like it doesn't,

1220
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,840
it keeps the thing alive.
He know.

1221
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:15,130
So I worry sometimes that if the more we
kind of push in one direction,

1222
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:20,131
actually the more sort of tension we 
create kind of coming back towards us.

1223
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,780
It's a bit like I Quito or something.
You know,

1224
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:23,620
you,
if the,

1225
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,310
if the force is coming towards you 
rather than push against it,

1226
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,030
just move to the side,
let it go past,

1227
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:28,864
you know,
there's something interesting in that 

1228
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,300
kind of movement.
Yeah.

1229
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:32,134
It feels like we plug into it.
I think about bumper cars quite often 

1230
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,033
that they know that we're these vehicles
that have an area when it goes into the 

1231
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:42,120
grid of negativity and anger.
And if we just sort of unplug from that,

1232
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,670
then you're not being sourced by in the 
same way.

1233
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:49,060
And I do think we can live in the world,
but choose not to be a part of that kind

1234
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,020
of thinking.
I agree.

1235
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:53,660
Can I run for some of these questions 
that Garath Dan just selling,

1236
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,160
make sure that everything's covered.
Uh,

1237
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,650
are you still in touch with teachers in 
Tibet,

1238
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,530
like your guru in that and who is your 
guru and you still study with him?

1239
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,470
Uh,
I'm very much still in touch with them.

1240
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:05,951
I,
you know,

1241
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:08,870
we were chatting just beforehand.
I showed you a picture of our,

1242
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,000
it was really nice.
I had a,

1243
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,730
uh,
one of the,

1244
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:14,040
the abbots from the Tibetan monasteries.
Um,

1245
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,080
my old retreat master,
he came out and visited everybody's name

1246
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:18,430
out.
He's La Llama.

1247
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:19,420
Yes.
She ran pushy.

1248
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,573
Ah,
cool.

1249
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,443
[inaudible] name,
which is normally always impressed when 

1250
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,390
I see them on a book.
It's quite,

1251
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,590
quite high up.
Those,

1252
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,410
those guys,
they've done their,

1253
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,830
they've done their time and lane,
he,

1254
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:31,870
he's not applying.

1255
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,840
Um,
and it was amazing.

1256
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,700
I was,
I was so mad at you or they love you,

1257
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:39,660
they're happy or they seem really happy.
And I was,

1258
00:57:39,661 --> 00:57:40,660
I was genuine.
It,

1259
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:45,661
that's probably one of the most magical 
special times for me personally,

1260
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,480
kind of in the whole headspace journey 
is having him come out here.

1261
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,703
Um,
he spent a day with the whole team kind 

1262
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:52,660
of,
um,

1263
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,080
our,
our annual retreat and um,

1264
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,920
and sort of know that it was his stamp 
of approval,

1265
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:02,020
but him coming out here,
it kind of felt like,

1266
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:02,854
wow.
Like that was really kind of meaningful 

1267
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,480
cause it,
you know,

1268
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,314
there is always the concern when you're 
trying to present something that has 

1269
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,454
been so carefully kind of looked after.
That's kind of traveled so many 

1270
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:17,910
centuries,
you know,

1271
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,410
of of messing with it.
You know,

1272
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:22,480
and I,
something I really calm,

1273
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:23,290
really care about.

1274
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,700
It's probably the thing I care about 
most.

1275
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,370
And so him coming out here and kind of 
saying this is,

1276
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,080
this is really kind of good for the 
world.

1277
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,700
That meant,
yeah,

1278
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,100
I meant a huge amount.
That's beautiful isn't it?

1279
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,330
Because that's one of the great 
challenges is how do we transfer it?

1280
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,220
Uh,
people have,

1281
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,970
can't see,
but you did it as if you were carrying a

1282
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:44,971
baby bird got to carry this thing is 
going to go in the wall.

1283
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,271
Precious,
you know,

1284
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:49,270
and I think it's really easy to lose 
again,

1285
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,730
two and a half thousand years of r and d
like,

1286
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,223
what's that?
R and D is sort of research development 

1287
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,773
kind of,
you know,

1288
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,693
I feel like it'd be so easy to lose the 
efficacy in all the time and attention 

1289
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,410
and precision that's gone into that over
countless lifetimes.

1290
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,870
And so I don't want to be the person 
that messes that up,

1291
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,580
you know,
come up with this thing.

1292
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,390
Add,
reiterate.

1293
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:15,940
Then Andy there I got,
what is it that like,

1294
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:17,150
what is it that,
uh,

1295
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,123
what is the teaching of Buddha?
And it's quite big question to come up 

1296
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:23,060
with.
Could you just sum that up,

1297
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:25,040
please end it.
And I like him but like,

1298
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,143
cause this is is it's Buddhism.
This headspace I genuine even as a 

1299
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:32,880
Buddhist monk,
I didn't um,

1300
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,310
self identify as Buddhist,
um,

1301
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,840
and deluded may monitoring wrapped in a 
blanket.

1302
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,913
What did he think he was a hell's angel?
Probably that's what you're going to be 

1303
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:42,464
off to the circus.

1304
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,300
I don't,
I just don't call it as not helpful.

1305
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,410
I just think that the whole,
the whole idea of,

1306
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,580
of meditation is letting go of labels 
and identity.

1307
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:57,520
So it was kind of ironic we then kind of
take on and adopt the label of,

1308
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,440
of being a Buddhist or a Hindu or 
whatever it kind of might be.

1309
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,670
So I personally didn't find that 
terribly helpful way of thinking.

1310
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,520
Um,
definitely.

1311
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,030
I,
I personally,

1312
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,690
obviously I practiced those teachings 
for a very long time.

1313
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,553
They're very much kind of a part of my 
life and they absolutely a hundred 

1314
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,230
percent influence kind of the content.
Um,

1315
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
and a responsible for the content.
[inaudible] it's in the APP,

1316
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,650
but I,
I don't think about it as Buddhist.

1317
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:27,290
You know,
we talked just now about the essence,

1318
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,400
the essence that is alive in every great
tradition and every great culture.

1319
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,910
I feel like it is the delivery of the 
essence.

1320
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,053
Um,
so it's that as the chocolate without 

1321
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,480
the wrapper.
Yes.

1322
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:41,120
Yes.
Imagine that if Jesus,

1323
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,960
Mohammed and Buddha met,
they will not have a fight,

1324
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,460
but they ain't go no,
fuck you.

1325
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,570
It's the same thing.
It's hard to imagine.

1326
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:52,190
I quite like just be at that dinner 
though.

1327
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,620
What they talk.
I mean,

1328
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:55,790
I wonder,
yeah,

1329
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:56,220
like,
uh,

1330
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,070
but like,
yeah,

1331
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:57,943
ultimately you're right,
the label people get hung up on the 

1332
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:02,720
labels.
People get hung up on the denominations.

1333
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,290
But I suppose like the,
you know,

1334
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,253
coming from a Hindu tradition,
the transformation of Buddhism was what 

1335
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,910
exactly fair.
Still a big question,

1336
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:14,481
isn't it?
But like,

1337
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:18,020
what was it like suffering and desire?
Watch out for that crap.

1338
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,350
I little bit of that,
I think dude,

1339
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,790
um,
the recognizing that,

1340
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,653
um,
cause I'm trying to work out is that 

1341
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:26,750
what happened to that man under that 
tree?

1342
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,950
Yeah.
Relevant to me now it feels like it is.

1343
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,550
Cause I again,
I I think these things are,

1344
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,430
they're timeless.
I think they're,

1345
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,180
they're universal.
And it's really interesting,

1346
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:39,014
you know,
you were talking about kind of 

1347
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,560
attraction to,
to,

1348
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,450
to the flesh and all those kinds of,
to even if you read those stories,

1349
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,573
like it's not like he was there and he 
was experiencing this perfect mind and 

1350
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:51,320
there were,
there were no thoughts of desire or lost

1351
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:54,650
or greed or desire.
All of that stuff was there.

1352
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,990
He was tempted was neen all sorts of 
forms and figures.

1353
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,990
I met him,
he was picturing kind of beautiful naked

1354
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:02,600
women.
And I don't feel like that's really such

1355
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:06,140
a kind of great leap away from where we 
are and have been most of us in,

1356
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:06,974
in our lives.
It's just there was such a kind of a 

1357
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:13,991
commitment to an intention to see those 
for what they were,

1358
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,360
you know,
simply as thoughts and not real.

1359
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,840
And not permanent and not,
and in,

1360
01:02:19,841 --> 01:02:20,040
in

1361
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,310
having that relationship and that 
perspective with his mind,

1362
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:25,050
with his thoughts,
there was,

1363
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,840
there was a release and therefore,
uh,

1364
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,980
a permanent at some stager,
a complete freedom from the,

1365
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,063
the,
the suffering of kind of our thinking 

1366
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:35,670
mind.
Yes.

1367
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:39,120
Is there some beautiful,
beautiful stories I felt,

1368
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,440
um,
like,

1369
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,353
like I said to you mate,
when I left my wife and a daughter not 

1370
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:45,954
permanently banned in the family just 
for a minute while I did this at Abbot 

1371
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,680
Kinney and wander around there on the 
short walk,

1372
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:55,890
I felt like the thought occurred,
I am already dead.

1373
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,980
You are already dead.
Everything that happens to you,

1374
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,840
it's meaningless.
Now those are thought you get get often.

1375
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,740
No,
not really,

1376
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,410
but it gets off the light.
I get versions of like,

1377
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,700
I think it exists to,
uh,

1378
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,160
to mitigate the for that there's some 
thing to acquire,

1379
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,023
to attain.
I'm very much a person that's I'm 

1380
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,260
objective,
fixated.

1381
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,960
Like I think I must do this.
I must get that,

1382
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:22,923
you know,
cause even when you sort of like that 

1383
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:24,414
when people do at in enlightenment,
cause I took psychedelics when I was 

1384
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:29,490
younger,
I recognize it cause I've shortcutted it

1385
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,720
sometimes when you get that feeling of 
self immolation and the idea of like,

1386
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:35,340
oh my God,
I'm not real.

1387
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,610
I remember like I was 16 year old kid,
I took acid.

1388
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,420
We've just like lads from now as it 
turned out like the Yorkshire,

1389
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,300
like tripping and like,
and I remember,

1390
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,490
Oh my God,
I'm not a person.

1391
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm not a person.
I know like I remember realizing it and 

1392
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:53,250
feeling it and like it's terrifying 
because you are,

1393
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:56,310
there's no,
we don't have any tradition.

1394
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,830
There's nothing to tell you that there's
no one's going all right,

1395
01:03:58,831 --> 01:03:59,664
this is just this temporary thing.
You're going to be here for a brief 

1396
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,300
while,
you know.

1397
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,210
So,
yeah,

1398
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:04,044
those thoughts occur to me and have 
always occurred to me and I've always 

1399
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:07,194
had,
uh,

1400
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,123
I've found something in me that does 
make me think that past life or some 

1401
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:12,054
version of that or interconnected 
consciousness in some form maybe a deal 

1402
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,960
because it like often thinks,
seem familiar.

1403
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,960
Often things seem attractive to me in 
ways that are,

1404
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,720
you know,
like you spoke of your own instinct,

1405
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,573
your own intuition.
You decided at some point I'm mafia to 

1406
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,530
go to the Himalayas.
Like,

1407
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:28,921
what's that?
Oh,

1408
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:31,140
I'm going to go and study with this guy.
You know,

1409
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,550
who is that?
Who's that?

1410
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,384
That speaking?
Who is me and like Adam Curtis on the 

1411
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,713
early guests on this podcast goes,
the problem of our time now is there's 

1412
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,200
someone in our air,
you know,

1413
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:41,034
the pink floyd lyric.
There's someone in my head and it's not 

1414
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,014
me.
There's someone talking inside your own 

1415
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:46,170
mind and that's not who you are.

1416
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,240
I've got to do this.
I'm going to buy that.

1417
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:50,350
I'm going to have a fight,
aren't going to perhaps that you know,

1418
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,880
you've become identified,
commodified condition,

1419
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:54,714
the trained to behave in a way that you 
are now completely detached from this 

1420
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:58,164
essence,
this essence that you talk about this 

1421
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,820
awareness and compassion who have no 
relationship with it anymore.

1422
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,740
Don't know that it's there.
And that's,

1423
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:06,660
that's the interesting thing for me.
I think the,

1424
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,240
and I agreed that the risk is that we 
think that it's,

1425
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,650
that it's elsewhere.
If we think it's not there or not here,

1426
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,220
then we might start to think

1427
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,380
that it exists elsewhere.
And,

1428
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,243
and I would contend that actually it is 
here and he is with each and every one 

1429
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:28,420
of us all of the time.
It's never anywhere else.

1430
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:29,254
It's just that maybe we don't have a 
sense of connection with it or we don't 

1431
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:35,300
have a familiarity with it.
And I feel that's the struggle.

1432
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:39,550
And a lot of people come to meditation 
rather than kind of allowing sort of the

1433
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,680
clouds the past to experience the blue 
sky.

1434
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:42,640
There's more of a sense of,
okay,

1435
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:44,680
right,
I've got to experience blue sky.

1436
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,680
How do I push all those clouds out of 
the way and how do I kind of create this

1437
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,514
space?
Like what I think meditation is rather 

1438
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:53,320
than just allowing a natural process to 
unfold.

1439
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,480
So I,
despite,

1440
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:56,314
you know,
whatever's going on in the world and 

1441
01:05:58,601 --> 01:05:59,434
whatever people are doing and saying,
I think for all of us or this is 

1442
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:04,660
something I find really kind of useful 
is,

1443
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,613
is knowing that look,
awareness and compassion is still there 

1444
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,543
for whatever reason,
the circumstances that conditioning the 

1445
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:15,130
environment as not necessarily allowed 
that to shine through.

1446
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,920
But it is there and it's there in each 
and every one of us.

1447
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:20,140
I really sort of profoundly kind of 
believe,

1448
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,060
believe that's the case.
Clearly.

1449
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,240
Willie,
can we conclude with some meditation?

1450
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:26,890
There are other questions,
but you know,

1451
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,600
they're not as interesting as the idea 
of ass though.

1452
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,460
Great questions.
Gaff,

1453
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,800
tape be hurt.
Like they've got like a like should we,

1454
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,700
can we conclude the call meditation?
We do a bit.

1455
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

1456
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:37,450
If you'd like to.
Oh,

1457
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,284
nice one.
Yeah.

1458
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,990
Couple of minutes.
Good or,

1459
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:41,770
yeah.
Yeah,

1460
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,360
a couple of minutes.
Great.

1461
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,480
I mean you're the bloody expert.
I,

1462
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,250
I'm really not.
Let me decide.

1463
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,170
Coke,
I don't think,

1464
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,700
I don't think there's ever been,
um,

1465
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,150
have ever been done in this particular 
right.

1466
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,620
Won't help us.
Okay.

1467
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,050
So know whether it's just us.
I sort of is.

1468
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,120
Anyone who wants to kind of join him 
when they're,

1469
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,650
when they're listening to this,
you know,

1470
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:08,840
just um,
general bit of advice.

1471
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:09,674
Just make sure that you're sitting 
comfortable and you're not going to be 

1472
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:13,550
disturbed for just a couple of,
a couple of minutes.

1473
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,670
It doesn't matter if there's a bit of 
noise going on in the background,

1474
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,180
but just taking a moment,
always when you first sit down,

1475
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:22,580
just a,
just to ground the body,

1476
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:23,563
so just feel the weight of the body 
against the chair or the floor beneath 

1477
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:27,884
you.
Soles of the feet on the floor and the 

1478
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:32,174
weight of the hands and the arms just 
resting on the legs and you can start 

1479
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,380
off with your eyes open,
eyes closed,

1480
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:42,950
whatever feels kind of more comfortable.
But if you have your eyes open,

1481
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:43,784
just drive your camera.
Other than to focus on one particular 

1482
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:49,250
point,
just have a nice kind of spacious,

1483
01:07:49,251 --> 01:07:50,084
relaxed focus.
It's sort of just takes in the entire 

1484
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:56,300
sort of space around you so you can't 
really see any one thing in focus.

1485
01:07:56,301 --> 01:08:01,301
You just see everything around you and 
just maintaining that soft focus.

1486
01:08:02,331 --> 01:08:03,950
Just tell you a couple of big deep 
breaths.

1487
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:09,670
Breathing in through the nose and out 
through the mouth.

1488
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,900
Just one more time.
Breathing in through the nose,

1489
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,673
announce for the mouth,
and as you breathe out this time just 

1490
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:26,621
gently closing the eyes and just feeling
that weight again,

1491
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:34,160
pressing down.
Allow any thoughts to just come and go.

1492
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:38,000
The mine's going to continue to think.
Don't try to stop any thoughts,

1493
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,210
just bringing the attention into the 
body.

1494
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,273
I'm just noticing how the body feels.
Is there a sense of heaviness or 

1495
01:08:48,701 --> 01:08:49,534
lightness in the body?
Does it feel like there's a sense of 

1496
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:04,980
stillness or restlessness in the body?
So not trying to change anything.

1497
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:15,891
Just noticing the feeling,
that sensation and as you sit there,

1498
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,850
just starting to notice how the body's 
breathing.

1499
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,473
So again,
we're not trying to breathe in any 

1500
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:31,040
special way.
Sometimes the breath will be quick.

1501
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,520
Sometimes it's slow,
sometimes it's deep,

1502
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:37,700
sometimes it's shower.
Just let it do its own thing.

1503
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,053
Okay?

1504
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,840
To begin with,
just noticing where in the body you feel

1505
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:48,070
that movement might be.
The stomach won't be the chest,

1506
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,553
you can't fit anything.
Just gently placing your hand on the 

1507
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:57,451
stomach just to feel that movement as 
you follow the breath.

1508
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:18,460
Just the help to to remain focused on 
that feeling,

1509
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:19,294
that sensation.
Just starting to count the breaths just 

1510
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:26,440
silently to yourself.
So as you fill the rising sensation,

1511
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:32,210
it count one falling sensation two and 
three and four just up to a count of 10.

1512
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,023
You starting again at one.
Just try that a couple of times through 

1513
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:44,574
on your own.
So for sure at some stage the mind's 

1514
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,550
going to get distracted.
Soon as you realize the mind's wandered,

1515
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,073
just gently acknowledging it,
letting the thought co and then just 

1516
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:32,141
coming back to the brain.
And just for a moment,

1517
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,040
okay,

1518
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,500
letting go nav even any focus on the 
breath.

1519
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,830
So just letting the mind for a few 
seconds.

1520
01:11:56,831 --> 01:11:57,664
Do whatever it wants to do.
It wants the thing that I think just 

1521
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:05,444
allowing the mind to be free and then 
just gently bringing the attention back 

1522
01:12:25,431 --> 01:12:30,431
into the body that's coming back to that
feeling of contact of weight coming back

1523
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,830
into the space around you.
Any sounds,

1524
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:43,790
sensations,
and then when you're ready,

1525
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,280
just gently open the eyes again.
Thank you.

1526
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,360
Ah,
that was good because it was mad 12th my

1527
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:04,990
and like you were there.
Oh,

1528
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,240
hello.
I'm there all the time there.

1529
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,660
It's that man for that team guys in here
as well.

1530
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:12,520
And that was amazing.
Thank you very much.

1531
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,013
The idea that it is always there,
the awareness and compassion is always 

1532
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:17,194
there.
Obfuscated only by men or static and 

1533
01:13:20,531 --> 01:13:21,364
external attachment,
which can be overcome with the learning 

1534
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:27,640
of these techniques.
Well done in your incredible work in big

1535
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,820
team.
Yeah,

1536
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,200
no,
yeah,

1537
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,033
yeah,
yeah,

1538
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,671
absolutely.
You know,

1539
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:34,150
you've been very clear that you work 
with a great many people and that you're

1540
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:34,984
part of a lineage in a yeah.
In both directions laterally and back 

1541
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:42,820
for the time.
Hopefully forwards as well.

1542
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,330
Yeah.
Hopefully unless you,

1543
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,220
this finally ruined.
I mean,

1544
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:49,950
is it good chance?
We'll see what happens between us.

1545
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,850
You can destroy all religion.
There's nothing left.

1546
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:54,803
But the thing,
I'll do the board and then we'll branch 

1547
01:13:58,051 --> 01:13:59,100
out,
branch out.

1548
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,950
Christianity.
Islam will leave.

1549
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,280
I was involved with that,
but hey,

1550
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,490
nice one.
Thanks.

1551
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,353
Right.
It's an honor to have you for having me 

1552
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:09,450
on,
man.

1553
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,283
Thank you.
Thanks for letting us record in your 

1554
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,100
studio.
Um,

1555
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,880
the,
so yeah,

1556
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,630
download the headspace.
Learn to meditate free yourself.

1557
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:18,550
Free Yourself.
Cheers mate.

1558
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:19,750
Thanks man.
Nice one.

1559
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:20,643
Thank you.

1560
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:21,663
Yes.
