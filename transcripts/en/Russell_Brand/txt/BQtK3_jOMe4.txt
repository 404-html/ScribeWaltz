Speaker 1:          00:00          I was fascinated by how particular, it becomes like juror number free. She didn't like us by that kind of thing. How particular it becomes and that we've got a sway that person, she will be swayed by x, Y, zed. And it becomes very sort of bespoke, doesn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:13          Well, um, you know, as when we're picking jurors, uh, the way, at least I view him, is there a certain jurors who I consider to be fillers

Speaker 1:          00:24          just go with the flow. Exactly. They're not going to affect

Speaker 2:          00:27          the jury deliberation a one way or the other. Um, so I don't worry terribly much about the fillers.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Well, how do you identify a Filler, uh, by talking to them? Uh, and, and that's the key attributes of a filler.

Speaker 2:          00:41          Uh, the key attribute of a filler is, um, uh, sort of a timid personality, uh, who doesn't seem to express any views in any sort of a strong way. Um, you know, just, just that sort of mousy person who's sitting in the corner and you just sort of know, uh, that, uh, if, if things get rough, they want

Speaker 1:          01:07          void it conflict of a, exactly. Exactly. Um, you want a few of them? Oh No, I'm happy. I'm happy to have as many of them as we can in 12. I don't, well, no, no, because you need at least one leader. Yeah. You need to leave now with the lead. And that's what you're thinking, right? This guys, I myself from a bisexual continually being accused of pushing people down the stairs I've had just about enough of, exactly, exactly. And, and generally

Speaker 2:          01:35          we're going to, you know, you're going to focus in on and there's going to be three or four people, uh, in any group that gets selected, have 12 that are not going to be fillers. Uh, and, and they're going to have various degrees of, of leadership qualities. And, you know, this is all sort of armchair psychology as well. Although, you know, he's strictly enough now with social media, uh, we get to, you know, if you, if you have the resources, you start looking at people's social media and you get really interesting insights into their, into their, uh, ways of thinking

Speaker 1:          02:11          based, they attended that rally. Exactly. Exactly. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Um, but, um, so you'll get three or four people who you think these are people who can really affect the deliberation.

Speaker 1:          02:22          So there's this whole, you know, there's the theater of the case itself, whether it's the famous staircase or any case. Then there's this secondary reality that takes place, annexed off over there where the 12 jurors go off. And in a sense that's, you can't really can, you can influence but not control what takes place there.

Speaker 2:          02:45          So then here's a good example. No. So in, in the Peterson case, where was one juror in particular? Uh, an older black man who we just got the sense all the way through, was really skeptical of the and their theory.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Well, it's just rolling his eyes. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          03:03          Body language, right. Um, anyway, uh, so, and it was pretty, I think everybody in the courtroom sort of got the same sense. Uh, anyway, so the jury goes out to deliberate in, in North Carolina. They're not sequestered. They don't, they don't have to stay in a hotel or anything. They go home. Uh, well, uh, over that next weekend on a Saturday night, uh, apparently this juror got stopped by the police, uh, and accused of a driving while intoxicated, which he claimed he wasn't. Uh, he got arrested. Uh, and we went into court that next Monday morning and the DA stood up and move to excuse that juror on grounds that the juror had, had, uh, been, uh, uh, resistant to the police that he was going to be angry, that he'd gotten arrested, that he couldn't be fair to the state, uh, and succeeded in getting that you're, uh, knocked off the juror who took that person's place was a white female about the age of Kathleen, uh, who was an engineer, which Kathleen also was. Uh, and we found out later and the juror was, the jury was split at that point. It was I think three guilty, three not guilty and six undecided. Um, and then once a new jury joints, they have to restart the node, the, the deliberations. I don't know know quite how they do that, but they're supposed to do that. Um, and that your ended up being the foreperson of the jury, the one who came on a and she ended up leading the charge to convict Peterson. Um, so,

Speaker 1:          04:50          and for all we know, they deliberately arrested that guy and the whole thing's constructed

Speaker 2:          04:54          that, eh, the thought crossed my mind more than once

Speaker 1:          04:58          because there's a game because it's a gay member as a game. There's so convoluted and so much of the process is not explicit. So much of it is masked necessarily mask that you're subject to influences. They're very difficult to account for to the point in fact were not only your own attitude to truth, which seems very sort of actually quite gnostic and beautiful. Like I, it's not my job to ascertain truth. It's my job to serve, which sounds like kind of a spiritual and beautiful idea. In the end it becomes like there is no objectivity at all, only power and how power can exert itself. And

Speaker 2:          05:32          well, that's certainly true in the criminal justice system. Uh, you know, we, we've seen that time and time again with all these exonerations of people, uh, who spent decades in prison, and then, you know, the DNA testing, uh, establishes that they weren't guilty. Uh, so what, why did they spend all their time in prison? Uh, uh, and generally it's because of the of power is because the police decided that they knew better. I knew best and that person was guilty. Uh, and then tunnel vision sort of kicks in. So you have a combination of arrogance and tunnel vision, uh, and, uh, uh, they ignore the evidence that's inconsistent with their own theories because they're arrogant and they have tunnel vision, uh, and they inflate the importance of the evidence that is consistent with their predispositions. Oh, it's called confirmation bias. We all suffer from it. It's just particularly pernicious in the criminal justice system

Speaker 1:          06:36          in a sense. Power kind of admit to its fallibility extensively without undermining its foundations.

Speaker 2:          06:45          Exactly. I mean, if, uh, if, if the authority is not infallible, then it loses its authority and then we'll just choose some other, okay.

Speaker 1:          06:55          [inaudible] right. This is infallible and

Speaker 3:          06:59          yes.
