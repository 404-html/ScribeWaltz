Speaker 1:          00:00          What point is the distinction occurring between sort of a living, vibrant earth which we participate in psychically, spiritually and totally and the earth as a resource and I wondered if that day, I wonder if that occurs in the transition from Pantheism, paganism to monotheism, which were the sort of sacred endowment of plants, animals, et Cetera, becomes these things are, as you say, instrumental. Do you think that's so significant? I think.

Speaker 2:          00:26          I think it's both a cause of this shift and a symptom of the shift, but the more distance we are from nature, the more it seems that God is not in nature but is kind of the external overseer of nature and and actual beings of nature lose their being ness. A lot of the things that we blame as cars are actually symptom. How do you mean? What do you mean by that? I mean, I'm seeing it a lot in, in climate change and environmental ism now. I hope it's okay to keep referring back to that because my mind is kind of in that space, but that, for example, one of the most alarming things happening is what I'm calling the insect Holocaust. Have you noticed that there's less bugs splatter on the window then when you were a kid?

Speaker 1:          01:11          Yeah. That less a good covering of Split Telecon Nice of a Steven Spielberg Sky splatter.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Yeah. It's not your imagination like there's been approximately a 75 percent loss of flying insect biomass over 30 years. So confronted with anything like that or forest fires or hurricanes. This mindset of fundamentalism, of money, of war has a jump. Excuse me. Have some water from this little baker. Thank you. It has us jump to the cause. What's the cause? Oh, insect die off. It must be climate change. Forest fires. It must be climate change, um, to, to find an enemy is one of the deep programs of our culture to solve a problem. Like I. So my son who's five, got this book from the library about superheroes and it has all these little anecdotes about the avengers or something like that. Uh, and each story in there, the template was the same, a bad thing is happening, the cause is a bad guy, and the solution is to defeat the bad guy by force.

Speaker 2:          02:31          So this, this is an example of a reductionism that also has us reduced the living complexity of earth to a single cause, which is why I'm wary of putting all of the environmental eggs into the basket of climate change and seeing if we only solve this one thing, then everything else will be fine. And then what do we not see in that? Reductionism? Reductionism always leaves things out and in this case it leaves out the repeated dousing of the entire landscape with pesticides over the last 90 years. It leaves out habitat destruction, it bleeds, it leaves out deforestation. Which one thing that came out of my, my research for this book is that that deforestation and land abuse is a much bigger cause of the flood drought cycle. Forest fires and other things. Then greenhouse gases. Well

Speaker 1:          03:24          advantage does the climate change narrative give the powerful that is not in their deforestation habitat destruction narrative in order for the climate change narrative to be favored,

Speaker 2:          03:34          it lends itself to quantitative solutions that you can make money off of.

Speaker 1:          03:38          It's always bad quantatative. What will you explain what you mean?

Speaker 2:          03:42          Well, you know, if it becomes a matter of, of say increase increasing carbon sequestration, then you can plant biofuels plantations across Africa, Asia and South America, which is happening that the numbers look good. The metrics look good, but what's happening on the ground is subsistence peasants are being forced out of their traditional lifestyles. Um, pristine ecosystems are being leveled to plant fast growing trees. A communal land holdings are being converted into titled The property. Um, indigenous people are getting evicted from their land, like when things get monetized and reduced to a number, the things that you cannot reduce to a number get left out. So the, in general, the, when we quantify things, they fit into a society that is built on measurement and quantification and ultimately the conversion of all things to the number called value. It's dangerous. And I mean, I could go on and on.

Speaker 1:          04:47          I met our goal and he was talking, as you might imagine about environmentalism and climate change while I was meeting him, I felt this feeling of deep frustration at not that alcohol might not be a nice guy because it's sort of documentary about him once and I saw he's capping and it did seem like a nice guy and he's captain with pictures of his dad up and stuff, human and uh, but what I felt was that everything he was saying was invisibly caveated with the phrase, unless it affects the interests of the powerful, we must do something about carbon emissions unless it affects the interest of the powerful. Then we went day. We must decide unless you energy concern, unless it affects the interest of the powerful. This thing that I instinctively felt. It feels like it maybe relates to what you just said and maybe have even more information on that.

Speaker 2:          05:42          Yeah. I feel a little suspicious of the dominant climate change narrative because the powerful are so willing to accept it. I think it's a lot less disruptive than the alternative narrative that I like to work with, which is the living earth narrative which says that the earth is alive, that it's health depends on the health of its organs and tissues and what are those. Those are the forests, the wetlands, the seagrass meadows, the mangroves, the elephants, the whales, the fish, the corals, everything that is destroyed by development is necessary. If you are in the carbon mind fret frame, then even if you value a forest for its carbon storage and sequestration, once you've reduced it to that number, you could cut it down if there's say gold to mine underneath it or oil and plant another for somewhere else to make up for it because it's just the numbers. Right? Or You could cut it down, but install lots of solar panels to offset that. That carbon. We're not treating Earth as alive and and precious and sacred by operating in that quantitative mindset, and I don't think that's a big enough revolution. I don't think that's why we're being initiated into a new kind of relationship to earth. Not initiated into let's be a little bit more clever in working the numbers. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 3:          07:18          All right.
