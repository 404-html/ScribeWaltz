Speaker 1:          00:00          Part of the documentary that actually I'm, I'm glad is there though. You didn't want there, but you know, I wasn't the producer and I gave all the rights to, it's the only way to be fair with it. The producer, after I worked with a young woman, you may remember who was this woman, she was in a cult where they abused as children, number four, Dev sex. It was

Speaker 2:          00:17          yes. And that blew you away. That that was a really, really, cause it was moved by that. And I was at, when I say the bit where you see you in the room when you've got a little bit of downtime and you're like, that really blew you away.

Speaker 1:          00:26          And that's how I was going on. So people don't see that in me because if I'm crying, they're helping her, which I did the two with good. But if I, I won't be able help her. So I, it comes through me and then afterwards I would go and I feel the grace of that. And to me that's often tears when it's so beautiful when someone's life has been touched. And then I figured out what I did so I can do it again or teach someone else.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Are you going to sage with that energy when you're like, uh, like fucking hell. That was a bit heavy but that our new feeling, so I love what I do for anything. It's not as intense for a start. I'm a comedian or entertainer. So I'm up there for an hour and a half, two hours. I'm like, I, all I've got to do is make him love and I fucking love doing it. But afterwards, like I come home and I sort of crawl into bed and just like, you know, I'd want to be told they're there. You're all right. You're a good boy. Oh cool. That's what I need to be told. Like you know, like sort of is that like if you got access to that level of vulnerability in yourself? I like this cause it seems to me, this is my love bug me.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Like, I mean, what do I have only seen a documentary and had a bit of a chat based things to me that you will very, very traumatic job and we're not nourished in the way that you should be. So you had to turn yourself into your own nutritional source. Yes. And now you're trying to solve all of the world's problems. Well, not one individual at a time. I've been in rooms where there's 10,000 of them, but like, uh, that's a lot of intensity because it's sort of actually, even though, you know, prior, in the earlier chat you told me like that they put all that athletic monitoring equipment on you and said that you burned 11,000 calories in nine hours and your heart's doing this and your house. And they're like, yeah, I believe that in the ability of consciousness and we'll to alter anatomy into a material to a degree. But the simple fact is it ultimately that you're, um, a man, where are you going with that vulnerability? What are you doing? Have you got like a mentor? Someone that you can call?

Speaker 1:          02:08          Not many. I've what's really beautiful, my life, the grace of my life is I've been called to help others and they look at me as their coach, but I'd be an idiot. The kind of people I have the privilege of coaching to think I'm just coaching them. I go there just like I did with you. I wanted to interview. I reached out to you. Unfortunately you want to chat with me too, which I was grateful for, but I wanted to reach you because I feel you have a very special voice when it comes to recovery that I have not seen anywhere else. So you have a passion and a truth and a vulnerability and I have a lot of that, but I'm only one person, so I'm good at finding brilliant people and then helping to pull out so other people can see at least the people that I have an audience for, you know, 20 million people on social media and they talk to people, so hopefully it reaches even more.

Speaker 1:          02:49          So I'm always on the hunt for human excellence. I'm on the hunt for someone who's real. My vulnerability is absolutely there. But I've trained myself like an athlete, like the most common question I've been asked by the media my entire life, it always makes me laugh is, well, don't you have bad days? Don't you have days when you're like fresh state and desired and pissed off and you watch TV and eat cheetos and watch pornography? And I said, well, I do some of those things. And of course I do. But what I, it's like an athlete. I built muscle over the years so that it's not that they don't have feelings, I don't get hurt her of the side of the pie for all those things, but they're not the dominant force in my wife. It's a muscle. The mind is a muscle emotion as a muscle.

Speaker 1:          03:26          I mean, I think the most powerful muscles are the invisible force muscles. It's your spiritual, emotional muscles like courage on you doesn't grow, shrinks. So I put my ass on the line regularly so that it grows and what keeps growing. And pretty soon the stuff that used to make me crazy, it doesn't touch me. It's not that I'm so great just I'm well trained. I trained his mine. I get up every morning in my life. You're talking about rebound, her more crazy shit ideas everywhere in your life. If I'm near, if I'm near any of my homes and some places I have, I have cryotherapy but my homes, I have these coal punches and our 56 degrees and the first thing I do is jump on their coal point so there's not a fucking morning where I want to jump in that I can't remember.

Speaker 1:          04:02          More intact could jump on that thing, but I don't negotiate with myself. I do it for two reasons. One, there's a physical health component moves your lymph system ever. The blood flushes through your whole body, but the main reason I do it even more than that is when I got up there, I don't get how people negotiate. Well, I'm able to tomorrow I'm going to do this or oh, let me like two more minutes till I'm ready Earth. None of that shit with me for decades. I go, I say do. I'm not here to discuss the shit with my mind, their mind and their soul and spirit and soul and spirit. My Soul fucking knows. And when I say jump, you fucking jump. I'm not here to have a discussion with you. Now, does that happen with my water every day? Yes, because I've conditioned it.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Does it happen every of my life? No. And when I find it's not working and I stepped back up and condition it, and unless I'm willing to take a hundred percent responsibility for what I feel and what I experienced, then I'm always going to be a victim to someone. Cause there's always going to be somebody's upset in the world we live in today about something you said or did or didn't say or didn't do. Go. There is no victory in the world where everyone has a voice and not everybody's voices necessarily designed to make somebody feel loved. It's designed to meet whatever their needs are in that moment, they might want certainty and you're being a certain way makes them uncertain or they think you're significant. You may think they're totally significant, but they don't. So they're mad. So I can't live my life that way.

Speaker 1:          05:14          So I live my life where I keep learning, I keep growing, I keep loving, I keep laughing and I'm trying to leave a decent legacy of a meaningful life by constantly looking for ways that can be helpful. And my prayer, simple prayer before I walk on at every stage is use me, use me Lord. And, and when you do that, it's like if you get out of the way, my greatest gift is getting out of the way. I know that sounds silly to some people, but it's really true. I'm not an ultra religious person, but I'm extremely spiritual and I believe the force of life comes through me. It comes through, comes through all of us, and the only gets in the way is all the beliefs we have of how it's supposed to be. All the expectations we have. And I have them too, but I keep leading them out.

Speaker 1:          05:53          So I'm not, I don't want to give you the impression that I'm, uh, I don't have challenges and things that nature, but I have a hell of a lot fewer. It takes a lot more. When something happens like this happen, I go, oh worthy opponent. Because in every story of a person's life, they have what they want and desire. And then they have these needs that they're unaware of, you know, character things that need to be developed. And how do those get developed? Well, if what you wanted, you just took action happened. Hey you'd be bored. Be you've never developed spiritually or your character. And so what happens is opponent show up and the opponent can be you with yourself. The opponent can be somebody close to you that feels like a bone or it could be an external force. But if you do battle with this, eventually you badly with yourself.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Cause if you can solve it within yourself, you can what we're to what happened to the outside world. You can have that sense that your life is meaningful. And so I've been battling for 58 years and I'm going to keep doing battle the rest of my life. But I'm, I'm doing better cause I've done battle so often. It's like why is Lebron James who he is? It's not because he's lucky, you know? How do I say? Yeah, he's lucky. He made have certain physical factions where Michael Jordan, I remember I interviewed him years ago and I said, what makes you the best in the world? Is it skill as a town is that ability is a backward, is a training, and he was so awesome. He said, Tony, I can tell you the truth that it won't sound like hyperbole or false modesty. He said, I didn't even make the high school basketball team my sophomore year. I was cut. He said, what it is is every day I demand more from myself than anybody else could possibly expect. I don't compete with other people. I compete with what I'm capable of. And it's just like that kind of standard is inspiring.

Speaker 2:          07:23          They see. It reminds me a lot. I had this conversation with Tom Cruise, right? It was like another Americans have great square jawed superstar and like he was sort of saying about how he made his success himself. I goes, no, but you were born with the Tom Cruise Shit like you had that. Even the will, but the will, you know there's not a, you might as well. Where do you think will come through?

Speaker 1:          07:45          Where did you will come from? I don't know. Where do you think it comes from? I think that would be better or something you have to push against or you don't develop it. How do you build a muscle? You don't build muscle because you were born with it. We're all born with muscle, but events developed. You trained it and that means you got to find something that you valued more than your pain. You got to get beyond your pain or you got to use your pain and say, I'm going to use it to become more. That's what my life's been about and now it's no longer driven by pain is driven by the joy of seeing people lit up.
