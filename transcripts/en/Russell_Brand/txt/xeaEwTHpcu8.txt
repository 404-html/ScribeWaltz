Speaker 1:          00:00          Luke harding is a British author and foreign correspondent for the Guardian, who's reported from Delhi, Berlin, and Moscow, and covered wars in Afghanistan

Speaker 2:          00:08          rack

Speaker 1:          00:09          and Libya. His books include Mafia state in which he discusses his experience in Russia and the political system and the Vladimir Putin as well as the snowden files. Very expensive poison. And His latest a New York Times number one bestseller, collusion secret meetings, the Imani and how Russia helped Donald Trump when at a book that has captured the imagination of the United States of America is doing phenomenally well. Right. Tell me why this book is so successful, please.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Okay. I think because it tells the Russian half of the story. Basically we have a, a conspiracy, you can call it an alleged conspiracy involving a group of Americans, many working for, for, for trump's campaign and indeed allegedly trump himself and, and a group of Russians. And, um, quite a lot is known about the Americans and the story about Donald Trump, his son, Donald Trump, jr jared Kushner, the president's son of Noah and so on. But, but less is known about the oligarchs, the intelligence officers. Uh, and also the fact that the, the what happened last year, um, owes a big debt to, to the Cold War. And I would say to the methods of the KGB,

Speaker 1:          01:27          well, this, um, obviously intrigued because while you were explaining that it's becomes clear that what we're talking about is the, is how power operates covertly and the kind of alliances that are formed in order to achieve power sometimes and con as in this case unconventional or at least novel relationship. So to explain to me, uh, please look, what are the key relationships that determining trump's ascent?

Speaker 2:          02:02          Well, the story goes back a long way, but I think to explain it in a way you need to kind of explain how, how, how Vladimir Putin thinks. And I'm not a, I'm not a psychologist, but I spent four years in Moscow working as a correspondent between 2007 or 2011. And I kind of got to know their kind of rather dark techniques, if you like. And um, the thing about Vladimir Putin is he's, he's a kind of classic KGB spy. Um, he, he spent his career in the KGB, some of it in communist East Germany. And he's going to worldview is, is predicated on the idea that America is the enemy, which quite often during the cold war, it was, um, that Russia is encircled by hostile forces, um, and wanting the kgb used to do a lot of, is to try and influence politics in the West European politics and American politics in particular, and, and to device kind of strategies. And, and the, the funny thing is that generally these operations back in the 1980s were not terribly, but the age of facebook and twitter plus the fact that there are all of these divisions in America Anyway, um, I think really open up all sorts of possibilities, especially with Donald Trump who, who for Vladimir Putin was the perfect candidate.

Speaker 1:          03:16          So what we ha ha what you're saying is that because of [inaudible] experience as a politician and as a sort of a covert agent, you have a type of politics that we w is what more covert then it would usually be. What is it that is, why is it significant that uh, like a president comes to power via relationships with a, a previous Lee, a state that it was previously an opposition to rather than say through alliances with transnational corporations that have explicit interest in the country where the president is a diego?

Speaker 2:          03:51          Well, I'm going to, I think transnational corporations don't hack stuff. Uh, now a lot of people are kind of the Americans hack stuff, that British hack stuff, the Russians hack stuff. I think what was different about the election last year was that, that um, it, if you believe Washington that essentially kind of crammed in hackers or quite often these guys are sort of freelances cooptive by the state, um, broken to Democratic Party servers into Hillary Clinton's campaign. And by the way, and to kind of Donald Trump's campaign as well. And they just released one set of emails at moments of kind of maximum embarrassment for, for Hillary. Um, in the summer of last year. Just Push, you had a kind of convention and again in October and what, we can't say that that trump one thanks to booton but what we can say was that Putin was kind of pushing, trying to push them across the line and the v these kinds of kind of hacks helped that. Now you might say, well you know everyone hacks, that's true, but this, this was a kind of an attempt if you like, to kind of influence the domestic political process from far away. So I think it was kind of different. And I also think it was

Speaker 1:          04:54          spectacularly successful. And I suppose it's surprising because America is usually a country where it is generally they like to be the people that's doing the influencing of other peoples national politics as opposed to being the recipient or the victim of. So I suppose what within it is the idea that power on a geopolitical level is shifting. Is that something that's interesting about it?

Speaker 2:          05:18          Well, I, I think it's, I think it's not so much that kind of power is shifting because Russia, let's face it, it's not an especially powerful country. It's still a nuclear armed state. Uh, and it has got plenty of tanks, but, but, but economically it's, it's not, not a pass and it hasn't really, in terms of ideas, it hasn't really kind of developed any great ideas. I think what it is is it's actually a story about opportunism that if you are a kind of unscrupulous, sort of sovereign power, um, that you can do a lot of stuff quite cheaply. I mean, the, the, the hacking for example, was done with phishing emails that, that people clicked on in the middle of the night when they were half asleep. Um, and some of the other stuff kind of relatively low budget, but it's about this sort of classic kgb doctrine. It's about exploiting, um, the, the kind of weakness in western society and turning it to your own advantage. Um, I mean I'm not saying preaching can have created all the problems in America that they preexisted him, but he certainly kind of took advantage of it.

Speaker 1:          06:15          I see. And I suppose perspective I have is that there's trump obviously anybody who's interested in politics and current affairs, he's sort of this wonderfully new, grotesque, grotesque Avatar upon which we can sort of hang our intrigue and our fascination. But for like, and then I'm really interested because of the depth of your experiences of journalists, the time you've spent in Russia or knowledge of the Edward Snowden case. What is it that in particular about trump is a distressing it cause like for me, it's personally without their breadth and depth of knowledge that you have, it seems that he's merely an amplification of preexisting phenomena. Just more visible version of what's been sort of happening anyway.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Yeah. Well, I mean I think that's true, but, but he's also someone, um, who the the savior state and it's rushed and successor was very keen to cultivate. I mean, this is a matter of facts and history and, and the thing is that we're supposed to keep on talking about the Cold War, but Donald Trump does something fairly unused. In the 1970s, he married a woman from communist Czechoslovakia and we know from the classical art do classified archive material that sort of checks spies, catch a very close eye on the couple in Manhattan. And, um, uh, talk to Ivanna's father who still live behind the iron curtain. And, and whatever they had on the trumps would have been fed to, to Moscow is part of a kind of a routine thing. Um, and you then fast forward to 1987 and the, the citizen Soviet government invites Donald Trump to, to visit Moscow and an all expenses paid trip.

Speaker 2:          07:55          And that was one of the things I kind of discovered was that the Soviet ambassador literally got off a plane from Moscow to New York when with his daughter to trump tower, saw Mr. Trump and said, ms, Mr. Trump, you have the most beautiful building in America, you know, and sort of schmoozed him. He did the kind of schmoozy thing. Would it be susceptible to schmooze? You say the daughter said it was like honey to a bee, basically that trump kind of melted that, that he liked this kind of flattery and recognition. There was a series of lunches and then an official invite the Soviet government, you know, we'll bring you to Moscow, et cetera. Now what sort of significant about that? I mean two things. First of all, the people who are arranged as travel, where intourist now interests was a Soviet travel agency. It was basically the KGB.

Speaker 2:          08:36          I spoken to kind of defectors who, who've say, you know, that the travel agency was the kgb so that we can say without being hyperbolic, the KGB brought Donald Trump to Moscow in 1987. Um, and then he was staying just off Red Square, not far away from, from dead Lenin and from, from sort of famous sort of pantheons of Soviet heroes. And they're, his room would've been bugged. Allegedly he was, he was discussing hotel building. But in reality this was a classic, it's cool to kind of cultivation exercise. It doesn't mean that, that, that he was recruited and was kind of striding round, red square wearing a colonel's uniform. But it means that they were interested in him. Um, and we also know from kind of leaked papers from that period why they were interested in him. They were basically the head of the KGB was berating, uh, his, his office is all around the world saying, you know, we need to do more to recruit Americans.

Speaker 2:          09:26          And they circulated a personality questionnaire for the kind of people they were interested in. They wanted people who were vein, uh, ambitious, narcissistic, um, you know, adulterous, perhaps had affairs that could be exploited. We're poor analysts and so on. And you kind of work your way down the list. And Mr. Trump, God bless him, ticks every single box. So the thing is there's a, there's a big backstory. I've kind of courtship now that doesn't mean that, I mean, we don't know to what degree trump kind of cooperative enormous. But what, what is very curious is after this kind of trip, about six weeks later when he's back in the u s he takes out a series of front page adverts in three newspapers criticizing Ronald Reagan's foreign policy and he announces, wait for this, he's thinking about running for president. It doesn't happen. Soviet Union collapses and his blood ambitions take another kind of three decades to flourish.

Speaker 2:          10:20          But what you have to understand is that these techniques, meanwhile, patients, niece Jeremy trying to do the same thing, he's trying to recruit students from national America. The, the, these techniques are old techniques updated for, for 2016, 2017. When you say these techniques, the do you mean the relationship between Russia and trump and trump's, uh, sort of aggressive antiestablishment announcement. I mean, the kind of wooing of people who might be useful. And it's a bit like, it's not that the Soviet intelligence knew 30 years ago he'd be president of United States, of course not. But they saw he had possibilities that he might be interesting and he with a range of targets. But what's interesting is that trump keeps coming back to Moscow does again in the 90s and then most famously he does it in 2013 when he hosted the Miss Universe beauty contest. And he's hanging out with oligarchs with mafia guys where people from the presidential administration, all of whom are slapping him on the back and, and, and really, um, if you believe the, the famous dossier by Christopher Steel, the sort of British spy who set this whole thing off, the kind of the cultivation operation resumed big time about five years ago and culminated with the Russians helping him.

Speaker 2:          11:30          Um, I'm not saying they made him win because millions of people voted for him, but helping them, helping them across the finishing line in last year's presidential election. Yeah, because it does seem like obviously the fruition of a 30 year relationship, it seems sort of on off, I mean there's not continuous but on and off because prior to the election, the relationship between sort of covert

Speaker 1:          11:54          relationships between Russia and the figures in American public life wasn't really a story that we were that interested in. Is it, is it something that you,

Speaker 2:          12:02          what, what now is because it wasn't happening? I mean that there hadn't been prayed successful and um, with, with, with trump, I mean it was, I, I've talked, I've talked to Americans who are kind of in the intelligence world are more or less doffing their hat and saying this is one of the greatest espionage operations we ever seen. I mean, they, they, they admit it was kind of breathtaking and when I was a writing my book as well, it's trying to write, I kind of thriller because it is a thriller or that sort of true there, there were a couple of questions to answer and one of them is why is Donald Trump's so nice about Vladimir Putin? When you say rude about everybody, I, I don't know if he's been rude about you, but he's been rude about Theresa May last week. He's been rude about the Germans.

Speaker 2:          12:39          He's rude about his Republican Party allies. He's worried about everybody. But the only constant thing that the sun rising in the morning is that, that he's always nice about Mr Putin. He says he's very smart. He says he believes him. When, when, when Putin says, you know, I had nothing to do with the hacking. Donald, I believe him. Well, no one else does that. Seemingly he believes the KGB Asian, the x one. Um, and this is very strange and I can kind of predict confidently the trump will never criticize Putin. And you have to ask yourself, why is that? And the answer, at least according to the steele dossier is because the Russians have got a whole load of compromising material. It's called Kompromat on trump dating back to the 1980s technical stuff, readouts of his conversations, agents, reports, um, and uh, and also allegations that the trump watch to kind of exotic sex show when he was in Moscow in 2013, which mail month may not be true. But nonetheless, at the end of the day, patient has enormous leverage over the president of the United States. And that's a remarkable thing.

Speaker 1:          13:39          It is remarkable, uh, is it seems, um, gosh, compromise. I can't imagine what

Speaker 1:          13:45          compromising material would be constituted of given the stuff that explicitly like says himself, like under stuff that bounces off him. You know, is it, I suppose what's difficult about what's challenging or in treat part or part of the intrigue? Is it, like you said, it's like the reference points are like the 1980s in the Cold War and John Le Carre's rent to you, it seems there's something slightly nostalgic but then the entire atmosphere of the type of, uh, sort of ethno nationalism and they're sort of bravado of trump and sort of a other emergent strands of nationalistic politics, they all swear seem to have something quite retrospective about them. So it's an extraordinary move mood, a mood that seems to be a prevailing at the moment. I suppose. What's, um, like you have mentioned what's interesting to me, it's like millions of people did vote for Donald Trump. The, the idea of Russian intervention prior to this would've seemed kind of bizarre. And like, obviously this is a very well researched and you're obviously right, but what I suppose is like interesting to me is what are the other reasons that somebody like Donald Trump would become president? What kind of culture becomes susceptible to a figure like Donald Trump? What does it tell us? I mean, do you think that the, that the involve that your book is saying that without the involvement of Russia, he would not have Donald Trump as

Speaker 2:          15:18          the president of the United States and that's what we should focus on it? No, I'm not, I'm not quite, I'm not quite saying that because I think, I think it's going to multicultural. There have, there are all sorts of reasons and as you say, um, millions of people voted for him and clearly it's got a lot to do with, with post 2008 with the financial crash. You mentioned global corporations, the fact that there are large numbers of people who just feel they've been kind of cheated by the system and saw trump has some kind of alternative and all of that is right and all of that. It's got nothing to do with Russia bat. It's also true that the hacking of this democratic party stuff really helped him. I mean it was a beautiful kind of campaign weapon. It sorts, it sort of undermined hillary. And I'm, the curious thing about this whole story is that I'm pretty certain, and also having spoken to lots of people in Moscow, uh, that, uh, Putin didn't think that trump would win.

Speaker 2:          16:08          He was the kind of, for the Russians, he was the kind of candidate of chaos. He was the guy who was going to discredit hillary so that when she became president, she would be weak. She would, she would be on the back foot. And meanwhile, leaving Russia free to do what it likes on the international stage. Now, of course, they kind of blew the doors off and trump became president. And, um, that was great. And so far as the, I launched my book in the New New York, but this kind of atmosphere of hyper partisanship in the states is absolutely kind of raging. So all of that chaos is good for Putin. But on the other hand, the one thing he really wanted was for, for America under trump to lift sanctions against Russia, imposed Auntie in 2014 by Obama following the war in Ukraine. And that hasn't happened because there's scandal is just turned into her monstrously big thing and is being investigated by Robert Miller who is, who is kind of beating a path to trump story. He's the special prosecutor looking at all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          17:07          Um, my concern is, is that in this diagnosis of Russian involvement being integral to the ascent of trump, other lessons may be missed, like you said, about the partner Zan atmosphere in America. I was recently in America and I sort of sensed a similar thing. Um, do you think that this sort of, um, kind of willingness to blame, like getting it all be it like, you know, like, uh, like I said to you, it's obvious from the, the steele report and the work that you have done that there is truth in what you're saying, but, um, you know, like, do you think that there's a sort of a, possibly a sort of a kind of a desire democratic left sort of center, left leaning liberal thinking people just to sort of find a reason why, why Donald Trump is president? There isn't because of the massive failure of liberalism to take care of the people that it was supposed to represent.

Speaker 2:          18:05          Yeah. I, I'm a, I mean I get that and I think your, your, I think you're basically correct, but, but it's, it's a complex world and two things can be true simultaneously. Liberalism as you put it, may have failed. Hillary Clinton may have been a weak candidate who fell to inspire. Um, Bernie may have been given a tough time by the Democratic Party. Uh, trump, let's face it, for all of his, kind of, for all of his kind of recklessness that there is something pretty mesmeric about listening to him speak. Even if he only says the same thing four or five times. I mean, he does have, I kind of rhetorical Pi, you have aura almost. You have to recognize all of that. But that doesn't mean that the Russians didn't help him. And that the point is that this is sort of seriousness that this is sort of serious because you think about Watergate, you had one group of Americans, this is a relatively low tech.

Speaker 2:          18:55          Bloc. Watergate was the packing room, his seventies with burglars and rubber gloves and lock pigs. But he had one group of Americans smearing another group of Americans in a, in a totally disreputable way. And then Richard Nixon covering up afterwards. What you've got here is one group of Americans, uh, basically invoking that, a sort of traditional adversary of the United States and getting them to help chop the legs off an opponent. Now, now that is different territory. I mean I called my book collusion, but we're sort of, we're not there yet, but we're kind of heading into the kind of treason zone. It's a lot more serious than a kind of domestic political squabble. And I think the worry is, despite the failure of liberalism as you put it, is, is that what it tells us is that our democracies are more fragile. Uh, two external manipulation of all kinds. Then we might've thought yes, but also

Speaker 1:          19:46          like in a way that's quite evident and obvious in terms of the experience of ordinary people in a sort of post globalized world. They like, you know, cause there's sort of that the, like the analytical strand that would demonstrate that would suggest that the reason that trump became popular is because he's, it's an emotional experience that people are voting for trump voters are having. Like this guy seems to understand how I feel. Like what, while that doesn't make rational sense, I don't think we're dealing with the rationale.

Speaker 2:          20:21          Yeah. But I mean that's, that's the kind of crucial point. And that in a way is why it's so alarming is that, is that that trump has a kind of master of this emotionalism. I mean, I've got people kind of one storing my review who bought an egg whisk on Amazon and then put one star, oh my book. Even though they haven't read it or bought it because they just don't like the idea in it. And, and it's, it's, it's the idea that it's not, it's no more important than what's true. What's kind of empirically real, what's important is what people can be made to believe. And there's a, and the thing is, is a great sort of relativist strand in, in Russian thinking in Soviet thinking. I mean, it was Vladimir Lenin, the guy behind the Bolshevik revolution a century ago who basically said that that truth was subordinate to the class struggle.

Speaker 2:          21:03          There was a kind of higher truth which out truth, the real truth of what what's actually kind of going on. And in a way what patient has done is sort of cynically take that idea and reproduce it. So he doesn't need to persuade everybody that Donald Trump is, is, is a great guy and that he's a faithful husband and all the rest of it. But he just needs to kind of persuade a certain number of people that that's the case. And that truth, that becomes a kind of matter. Truth, it feels still with me. Um, and I think it's quite scary because ultimately it's a kind of, where we are now is it's almost like an assault on, on rationality and the idea of a, of a, of a uni truth, if that makes sense. But where does politics have to go? But that place, you know, see like the, in a way they're sort of trees, like, you know, like whether or not it's treason.

Speaker 2:          21:47          Literally his treats him for another state to intervene in the democratic process, uh, of, uh, uh, second nation. Yes, of course it is. But like powerful entities continually intervene in the democratic process. So in a way we were already dealing with that phenomena is just here. It's a quite, seems quite defiant and bold it oh, bloody hell. And it's literally the Russians as well as this sort of hyper aggressive, I mean, I think it's funny, isn't it over the last year that the Democrats had been in disarray, and let's face it, British politics hasn't been in great shape. And the funny thing is it's been sort of, I dunno, it's been people in civic society, it's been activists. It's, it's been, it's been infested with Janice like myself who've almost be kind of filling, filling the gap. And I sort of make, make kind of two quick please.

Speaker 2:          22:35          One is, I think we need, I think in our trouble, confusing times. We need good method. We need to be evidential. We need to kind of admit when we're wrong, the facts might change. And we need to kind of be humble in the face of some very kind of complicated stuff. Uh, and the other thing I would say is so an urge people to kind of buy newspapers if you don't have the Guardian by something else or just contribute to news because we need, we need people doing this stuff, I think more than ever. But it feels to me that these categories are being challenged. The idea, even of a nation state, I think people are starting to feel this doesn't work for me any more. They're the, the, the United States of America doesn't represent my interests. It's kind of a veil that's placed between me and power. And now like, so for me, that the trump becomes a sort of gross, a grotesque example of what's proceeded in Tfa. Like this is something I've been mentioned in ever since I heard it in, in this room. As a matter of fact, the academic Kai Hindi, Andrew's this sociologist said, Donald Trump is a better president for African Americans and Barack Obama because under Donald Trump we are confronted with the truth of what politics

Speaker 1:          23:46          actually is, what race in America actually is, rather than dealing with the temporal distraction. That was, that was Barack Obama and out like, you know, I'm in no position either racially or academically to make such an assertion, but something about that resonated very deeply with me and it seems like that while we sort of get all anxious about this, of which agencies are involved in organizing news empower, the key issue is, are ordinary people being given access to power? Are they able to control their lives? No. Were they able to prior to Donald Trump? No. Is Donald Trump sort of worse than a bit nasty seeming, madly sexist and in some instances vulgar and grotesque, almost beyond imagination quite clearly. But what concerns me is this sort of attempt to sort of scramble backwards to look, just can we get back to where we were eight years ago when it was at least nice seeming people that were doing stuff less vividly.

Speaker 2:          24:46          But that, but that's not my thesis. Um, brilliant thesis on the involvement of Russia. But like I said, but what concerns me is that how this will be used by neo liberal politicians in the United States of America to sort of try and reinstate what proceeded trump when the lesson that really needs to be learned. It's politics needs to radically shift the way that power is organized, needs to radically shift. And like, it's not like, you know, this just Asher, Tony Blair back in or Bill Clinton. That's not the answer. Um, I think I did this disagree with you, but, but I, I sort of think, um, one thing we need is we need good storytelling actually. Um, we were talking about shifting power back to the people. We need to tell good stories. We need to engage people in, in this stuff because obviously it fascinates you and it fascinates me.

Speaker 2:          25:31          But it leaves some people kind of cold. And I, I'm not sure that, that, you know, the stories, the little mini stories that Donald Trump tells on twitter, very powerful. They're very emotive that get food to millions of people. But, but um, there are other stories as well. And I think at the end of the day, my job is to try and, um, in the areas I understand, you know, Russia and also did lots of stuff on offshore, on, on, I did the Panama papers, the paradise papers is to, yeah, yeah, I did Snowden, I did the Wiki leaks stuff. I've done all of these kinds of, the big investigations last for years and I've sort of written books about most of them is to actually take these kind of quite complex themes and to tell them in a, in a really exciting and racy way, it's nonfiction. It's all true.

Speaker 2:          26:15          It's all, it's all, it's all granted, but so people can kind of read them, not necessarily scholars or students from international relations, but the kind of thing you can read on the beach or on a train. Oh two things that I want to do, like in this, this next beat of the interview. One is I want you to, if you don't mind, read us what you think is the bit that exemplifies what you've just said. Then like sort of populist, accessible, thriller, right in from this book, collusion. And now I think he's, can you explain this story of Edward Snowden is like [inaudible] sort of, he, he roic

Speaker 1:          26:44          pail of our time and I, I'd like to, you know, like sort of give, this is precedes Donald Trump. You know, like this is like, you know, this sort of like exposure of corruption and the way that it was handled. The White Bengal, donald snowed a that, that, sorry, the Edward Snowden was exiled. You know, this all happens for trump's not on the landscape at this point. This is all under Obama and this isn't the proceed previous administration. Can you explain it? Tell us like, you know, using your thriller and pop from the Ra skills. A little more about that.

Speaker 2:          27:14          No, no, you're teasing how routine, sorry. So what do you want me to do? Sorry Dude. It's no to one first cause cause he seems to me like a hero. I can get my chops around. Well, I mean think about snowden is that he's a kind of classic whistle blower and, and um, uh, I mean I read a book about her man that I'm kind of very admiring of him. Uh, essentially what he was someone from inside the American intelligence community who realized, uh, to his kind of gradual horror that the United States government and the UK by the way, and various kind of Anglo Saxon partners where hoovering up all of our electronic stuff, regardless of whether we were criminals or old ladies or students doing gcse. It was all being sucked up. Text messages, web searches, emails and, and then, and then that kind of geolocation data you have from your iphone, so where you've been, et Cetera, all of that is recorded every two seconds.

Speaker 2:          28:05          And there'd be no public debate or conversation or kind of reckoning as to whether it was appropriate. And the volumes had gone from small in about 2002 massive billions, billions a day, 30 billion plus items a day. Uh, and he, he blew the whistle. He leaked the stuff to my newspaper, The Guardian. He fled to Hong Kong and he's now living in exile in Moscow. He kind of got stuck there basically by mistake and I think he's a kind of heroic figure who kind of pulled across the curtain and showed us the real nature of, of of reality in the 21st century and at least allowed us to have a kind of proper conversation with power about what's appropriate and not appropriate. Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:48          Wow. That was brilliant. So like, you know, if that's what's proceeding and trump, how significant is the Fisher that he represents in, cause it's not like he what proceeded had any values anyway. These are these they are captured. So like I can really understand how that the, there is an appetite for trump for a figure that's like, you know, these, you know, trust these people you it or drain the swamp. I can see how that kind of language is going to be resonant when it's in the ether. Anyway. That was what proceeded him. Was that an environment that required Edward Snowden and when it would snow and does do that, it's not like this guy's a hero. Bring it back. Let's have a parade. Drape him in the Stars and Stripes. No, the guy goes and lives where Russia now the feelings in this one?

Speaker 2:          29:31          I, I mean it's quite, it's quite interesting because obviously I wrote a book that the American intelligence community didn't much like, I think there might like this one a bit, a bit more because I won essentially because, um, the, there are questions inside Washington. I mean basically what I was told, having taught a sources here, here, here, and, and in the states a lot is that, you know, there are a lot of Americans, it's inside this intelligence establishment, let's call it that. If you like, who, um, disagree with what the presence doing. I mean, generally they tend to be kind of more right leaning than left. But Obama, they might not like what he was doing, but, but essentially they recognize his right to do it. And the thing about trump, what makes him different is that they are genuinely asking whether he's a Patriot actually, whether he puts American values or however you want to call it first American democracy faster, whether actually he puts his own personal and family interests above everything and what deals, especially financial deals. He might have cut with Moscow both recently and in the past. And so that we're in a very curious place. We, we're in a sort of situation where we don't entirely know where the real loyalties of Donald Trump are, but what are these values?

Speaker 1:          30:44          What are the values that he's breaching like now, because I have what I sense the energy that I sense that he is writing. Is it kind of an emergent rage coming from the feeling of nihilism coming from hold on a minute, this then this isn't real. None of it's true. So like, you know, like so when people are kind of like, oh, this guy's an anomaly or now an outrage, I feel like, well what, what are these values? I mean, of course it's disgusting. Some of the things he said about women, some of the racist stuff, all disgusting. But when it comes to like, what is this citadel that's being defended? Because it seemed like it was pretty disgusting. Anyway. And now I'm asking you this as a person that knows a lot about international politics,

Speaker 2:          31:27          like the show, but I mean, I, you know, I, I'm, I'm not a politician. I kind of described ran it, but I don't know. I mean, I guess what I would say, I mean, if we can just sort of take a America out of it. So it's not just kind of your eras facing until, could it more generally? I mean, I, I sort of, I've spent a lot of time in my kind of career as a reporter for the Guardian as a foreign correspondent in war zones. I mean, I've, I've been in pretty sketchy places in Afghanistan and Libya and Iraq and, and Ashley, what do you talk to ordinary people? They don't, I mean, I wouldn't say that kind of neolistic that there, but they did kind of want, they want sort of decency. They want kind of healthcare. They want jobs, they want their kids to have a future.

Speaker 2:          32:06          They want sort of, uh, they want governments that change. I mean that, that's the kind of key thing about governments is that one, one law, it has to go in a lot has to come in and maybe I'm set fantastically old fashioned fuel for your program. But I actually do believe in, in kind of brilliant basic human rights and universal values were supply everywhere, whether it's America, Russia, central London or ever. And I think we've slightly lost track of that. I, and I actually think, I see that these places you were a foreigner or Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, all countries chewed up by this thing that we're trying to preserve and cherish. And there, no, I mean we're not trying to cheer up interventionism I mean, we're not trying to kind of defend kind of these kind of grandiose misconceived imperialistic projects. I, I'm, I'm starting from a position of, you know, if you, if you're a war reporter, actually it's a very easy thing to do.

Speaker 2:          33:00          It's much more easy to report on war than is to report on Brexit because you just talk to ordinary people. You ask them stories, you'd ask them about their lives, their kids, why they fled. You know, what they saw, who they met, he pointed a gun at them and he tell those stories as well. My point about storytelling, I just think it's really important, it's kind of elemental that we tell the right stories that we tell kind of pro human stories, but that, that we, we try and seek the truth rather than a truth and also that we don't totally lose faith in, in humanity and kind of succumb to the Neil Ism that you were talking about earlier on and we must never do that. We must never do that. When you're in your work as a war correspondent, it becomes clearly human cause it's an identifiable situation and you feel you can obviously connect with that humanity until their stories where it was in more complex situations.

Speaker 2:          33:54          Somehow it is what it is. Opaque. Well it can be. It can be very, he said, she said that's the, that's the bump. It can be, you know, there's kind of, there's sort of the, you kind of have to sort of go and find banners and sometimes when you're doing that, you actually lose sight of the truth, which is, for example, one group of people are shelling of bunch of civilians. There's not really he sheds. She said it's just, he shall, Ye shall know that just, you know, that is the reality. You have little pun there about people being killed by heavy artillery. And we'll read us the best bit or not the best bit a bit of this like, you know, pop you laray and all of that. Yeah. Um, well, so this book begins with Christopher Steele, who's the British spy at the heart of all this.

Speaker 2:          34:37          Uh, and I went to see him about four weeks before his famous dossier was published in January by buzzfeed. Um, and I go into his office, a modest ground floor suite knew this was the best bit straight away. Cause this is a bit, you do when you do readings. Is it, this is the first time anyone's asked me to read from this book. So I'm actually, I'm actually improvising king. No, no, it's a bit old school reading. But anyway, um, so yeah, grandpa sweet couple of bear rooms painted. I rewire to kind of map of the wwe world fixed to one wall. This is Christopher Steele's office lined up near the director's desk. He's the director of this business intelligence, um, uh, from a nesting Russ Russian dolls called Matryoshka, a souvenir from Moscow. They feature Russia's great 19th century writers, Tolstoy, Gogol, Lermontov, Pushkin. Um, and I say, and the tumultuous days of 2016, the dolls were as good as a ma, as good as any metaphor for the astonishing secret investigation had recently been asked to do.

Speaker 2:          35:39          It was an explosive assignment to uncover the Kremlin's inner most secrets with relation to one Donald J. Trump to undress them one by one. Like so many dolls until the truth was finally revealed and it had Russian belts in it. I'm absent some figures from Russian literature. I thinking I've wanted to know what was going to happen next. Read the book, take it to ridiculous extremes. Entry could be going on me, snatch me out of my life. Bury me in language. No, no, no. I will read your book. I'll read it when bloody hell might come on. You've got this number one best seller. What'd you want? You want everyone in the world to read? He can't give into that kind of ego. That's one of the things. Your story or your lecturing me on ego. What, who, who is better qualified?

Speaker 2:          36:35          Come on this. Getting some more stuff. There's going to alike like a proper deep gear in here. I mean one thing, one thing I didn't talk about my experiences in Moscow, I didn't know if you want to hear about that. They kind of um, helps shape the book and write the book because basically after doing all of this war that we talked about earlier, um, in the Middle East and elsewhere, um, I lived in Germany for awhile. I did side trips to Baghdad and then I was posted with wife, wife, and two kids. Well not, not in war zones, but kind of on forum postings. And then we moved to Moscow. And this was, do you remember that? This is the case of my, uh, the celebrities, my previous book of very expensive poison. I don't know if you remember the case of Alexander live in Yanco was a Russian desk dissident, famously, famously poisoned umbrella.

Speaker 2:          37:23          No, it wasn't a brother. It was a radioactive cup of tea, uh, given by two criminals, assassins in a hotel not too far away from here. Um, and I arrived shortly after his murder, uh, and I started investigating this story and it was made pretty clear to me in Moscow. The, my, my inquiries were most unwelcome and I had strange guys wearing cheap black black leather jackets and brown shoes following, following me around the icy streets of the city. And it's scary, mate. Well, hang on. I mean that, that was, that was the funny bit because that was more kind of clue. So then kgb, I mean that was, that was, um, uh, that, that was kind of okay because they will come and sit next to you in a cafe and why it was clear that, not like that you wouldn't lie that well.

Speaker 2:          38:05          Okay. So there was that and there was sort of electronic surveillance as well. So whenever I made it kind of phone call or told a joke about Pooja and there would be a kind of ominous on the phone with a line cut. So then you redialed you make another joke about Putin. And so it was all very demonstrative. The idea was to sort of show that, that they were on your case, that they were listening. Um, and, and the thing that really, um, kind of disturbed us because I was, cause I said by kids were at that point our kids were six and nine was we had a series of breakins at our apartment where we live in Moscow. And it was done in a kind of most obvious way. This is from the kind of KGB manual to show that they've been there. And one of the things they did, for example, was when we were living on the sort of 50th floor of an apartment block in Moscow, that they busted open the the window next to my six year old son's Ikea bed with a sort of 20 meter drop to the courtyard below.

Speaker 2:          39:04          So that was kind of broken and left open. In other words, implying that he might just meet with a little accident and there was a lot of very crude stuff like that family fate is deleted. Um, and, um, uh, we, we sort of sought advice from the British embassy in Moscow and they basically said, you are bugged. And I said, well, look, is there, is there anything you can, you might do about this? Can you get rid of the bugs? And they said, well, now we come, you know, have a cup of tea and a biscuit. You just have to live with it. So we had, we were basically, and we discovered there was video as well. So we have three and a half years before I was eventually deported from Russia under surveillance in the bedroom, the living room everywhere. Um, and, and the reason it's relevant is that when you, when you sort of try and think about would Putin of tapes, Donald Trump in Moscow in 2013, you, Betty Wood, this is what they do.

Speaker 2:          39:54          This is what they did to me. If they have a whole technical department that does this stuff, they're quite fixated on sexual behavior. Uh, on one occasion they left a sex manual bile bed when we'd been away on holiday and Berlin and we came out to discover this, this book in Russian, uh, lying there. And I sort of picked it up and I thought this is the most strange moment of mine. I've what message of the KGB 20%. Well, you're not a bit frightened mate. Well, eight went out that window bit. I mean, yeah. I mean the thing is that what they've very good at is they're sort of try and find your point of vulnerability. So for most people is their kids there, you know, the idea that something might happen to your children. It is, it's kind of really a sort of primal thing.

Speaker 2:          40:31          And in my, I think the goal was basically to make me stop writing articles that they didn't like and probably to decide with my wife that it was time to pack our bags and leave Moscow. Well because, well, first of all, because my wife's brother cool and, and independent and kind of feisty and she had her own life and she was enjoying it. I lucky in Russia you'd have to part with a sex manuals when it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't open windows. I wasn't quite as crudely phrase, but, but yeah, I mean you're, you're right. Um, but also I was kind of furious. I mean, I sort of thought, well that's what they want me to do. And so actually it didn't stop my reporting in fact rather so sharpened it. But what it did do was to include it in the reporting. I could am I in the book I read off, I got kicked out, which was called Mafia state, which, which I read from London.

Speaker 2:          41:16          I'd been bender, been expelled from that point, but at that point, but what it did do was give me a kind of insight into, into the thuggish newness to sort of crude nature of the KGB. I mean, they're very keen to sort of show that there are master that they kind of control the situation. Um, they don't subtle. Um, and they, they kind of target people messed at random. And, and the, the contacts I made there that the way I saw how kind of the Russian intelligence kind of know matrix works really helped with this book on, on Donald Trump. Not, not because, you know, trump trump what he had slightly different experiences, but I kind of, I understand they're kind of dark wellview actually. Um, and we survived it. Congratulations. And it's bloody terrifying now. So like sort of an aspect of Russian, the Russian political strife that was presumably to some degree subordinate, the KGB, you're saying it's now been elevated to supreme potency in the figure of poo in.

Speaker 2:          42:17          So we should expect those tactics. They're sort of take place it on the national stage in the way they may have only done covertly or domestically. I mean essentially preaching for [inaudible]. It's Cold War. He's doing it again this time he's determined to, to sort of win. Um, he, he, he, he sees Russia and opposition to the United States. There's even a Russian word for it, which KGB, it's a in all the KGB manuals, it's called love me proteomic love. And they put ethnic, which wins the main adversary gladney procurement. That, that's, that's really how Putin views views the u s and we use the UK as a kind of little sidekick of the glove and the protein ethnic. Um, and um, he's doing a pretty good job of prevailing, I mean, when a Cold War, I mean, well, you, you don't necessarily win, but what you want to do, you want to do, you want to keep, keep your enemy in a state of perpetual weakness and, and disarray.

Speaker 2:          43:09          Uh, and they're pretty good at that. That's pretty good. That you said earlier that the sort of American secret service community regarding this is a sort of an inconceivable master stroke. What's occurred that there sort of a spirit of chaos has been unleashed in an American? I W Bruton didn't do the unleashing. I mean the chaos was there. He, he, he just took advantage of it basically. And, and, and, and it's in a way, it's kind of quite crew, but it's quite effective. I mean, he had gangs, they've got this troll factory, there's famous troll factory and some Pittsburgh weather up there are gangs, have sort of cynical students earning $15,000 a year who posts comments in, in pretty good English on western websites praising Putin or, or, or adopting kind of talking points. They did it in the Guardian for years and years and years.

Speaker 2:          43:55          And during the American election, these Russian students called Sergei were pretending to be text and housewives called Karen, uh, writing about, you know, tweeting, um, gifts of Donald Trump propping a Mexican in the bin as saying, Cheerio Pal, you know, stirring up passions over immigration, pretending to be activists from black lives matter. Uh, and loads and loads of Canada. Yeah. Loads of other Americans were, were gleefully re tweeting this stuff, seeing it on their facebook pages, liking it thinking I Look Karen, you know I like, I agree with Karen and Karen is really Sergei and say you don't need to be a genius, you just need to be a kind of opportunist and you need a little bit of luck.

Speaker 1:          44:40          So these, I suppose that even the sort of slightly comedic act of like

Speaker 2:          44:46          sp or would you, would that even work at the title espionage and sort of subterfuge? Subterfuge has an impact on the sort of feeling of being a marrow. It permits new permits, a different kind of discourse. What I was saying that is the war for the mind. It's kind of almost sort of, it's shopping what's already in your head and it's kind of an, and actually if you kind of micro target, if you look at swing states, you can have quite an influence. Now, what's interesting is that sort of a, you know, everyone's on facebook and facebook said initially know that the, the, the, the Russians, what Russians, what are you talking about? And then something, he came back to Congress two months ago saying, AH, yeah, we've, we've found all of these accounts paid for in rubles from Moscow were, yeah, they were actually pretending to be activists are pro trump supporters, but really they were Russian systems.

Speaker 1:          45:32          Do you think then if the, is that something is sort of broadly like something has comedic is that can be effective in the war for mental space then what we can, can we speculate as to what the impact is of that, the on going, uh, what do I want to, how do I want to turn this, this sort of maintenance of the dominion of a sort of a capitalist consumer culture. How we're continually, how our thoughts are marshaled, controlled, how we continually stimulated market it at, you know, like, so what do you think of those as obviously an excellent and did diligence story teller. You're probably one of the best people doing this. I'm guessing. If you look from the justice for Tamir and your CV, then it would snow. Then you've done in paradise papers, you've done the collusion with Russia. What do you think? Um, what do you think of? No, see, like these, this is an anomaly, isn't it? Like it seems to me that just different people are getting a little go at telling the story, but it really only using this

Speaker 2:          46:33          sort of,

Speaker 1:          46:34          they're using techniques that existed before, in a sense. The there in a way to have aims and ends that aren't that different from previous, I want to say administrations, but it seems like previous movements, previous movements in American life. So over the last 30 years of what's happened to, there's probably created this state of disillusionment and disenfranchisement where the mind can be sharpened to a point of nationalism. So what do you think about like that, those kind of stories that are sort of so pervasive that they are harder to identify it? Do you think it's, starts to sound a bit too wacky and conspiratorial? You know, cause I feel like that's what's the reason why I'm interested in Luke is this [inaudible] my, again, my intuitive sense is that the, the, the, the, the oft made connection between Brexit and trump is a reasonable one in that you have swathes of people feeling a sense of that they are lacking purchase. They have had enough. And my fear and concern is that by diagnosing the anomaly as the problem, we prevent people from analysis analyzing the proceeding conditions but inevitably led towards it. And why I'm fascinated by people point it out like more

Speaker 2:          47:52          covert, more insidious forms of tyranny such as what proceeded trump interest me. Do like, well, I'm, I mean I, yeah, I mean I take your point, uh, but I, I do, I do think that these two things can, can both go on. I mean the, that, the external conditions put, we call it color that they're produced. Brexit absolutely are real and they are primarily British. Um, and, and we, we can talk about them forever. And there are people who are genuinely disillusioned and have good reason to be kind of fed up with the system in the state. All of that is true, but at the same time it's perfectly valid to see whether, for example, Sergei and Saint Petersburg was also setting up an account, uh, tweeting in favor of brexit because we know that that is the case. There were various kind of trolls pretending to be Brett's micro topic targeting leave leaning voters during the run up to the election.

Speaker 2:          48:46          And the pigeon is very delighted with brexit because it weakens the European Union and it weakens the UK. Uh, and that that's all to his advantage as he sees it. And they're also question marks about where the money came from behind the leave campaign. That, I mean, it may all have been legitimate donations from, from, from noble business people, but, but there's a lot of, it has been routed through offshore and it's kind of terribly a pig. So I think we can, we can diagnosed the social ills in our own country, but also be alert to the possibility of external manipulation, whether it's from Russia or indeed from anywhere else because he's fascinating. Yeah, it is fascinating. And it, it is a, it is a conundrum because if we, if we lose faith in democracy, if we lose faith in, in, in the possibility of a decent or a better society, if we lose faith in each other, what, where do we go? And the thing about Putin is that he is a kind of supreme near list and he, he, he likes those conditions where people end up believing in nothing because that suits his sort of agenda because it, he can do his sovereign thing without anyone calling him out. So, so I think we, we, we, we do need to be even something, but we do need to be honest, um, uh, about what's going on.

Speaker 1:          49:56          Presumably, you know, having lived in Russia, I exposed as a sense that I'm actually okay. Okay.

Speaker 2:          50:01          If there is going to be a geopolitical

Speaker 1:          50:04          struggle, uh, on the ultimate scale, probably would prefer things to be how they are in Britain than Russia having lived there. Those ration Porno mags.

Speaker 2:          50:13          Yeah. Yeah. It was that, it was actually a book on sex and relationships, but they had quite leave it. They deliver. It was bookmarked help limb outage while they hit it was bookmark to a page on orgasms. So I think they were trying to tell me I'm a while it was

Speaker 1:          50:28          supposed to be both and I think I didn't know whether they were making a comment about frequency or technique or all kind of inconsistency. Oh, I'm not sure. But basically they were saying, you know, we are watching you if they're well intended, what if we re reposition Putin is a well intending sort of avuncular figure there simply to try to help you if your sex, life and American, you know what I think, I think you should get him on your show and you can talk to him and then you can decide. I can't imagine. But what I certainly agree with you on luke is that we cannot afford to become disenchanted with the potential for democracy to be effective at. Because I think that in my own diagnosis, which I will happily admit is from limited resources. It feels to me that this despair is what has contributed to these dis junks to these sort of sort of horrifying moments if it culturally whatever side of those divides you stand on. Even when I, people of marching in Charlottesville when it's sort of outburst of rage and low thing and sort of targeted at minority is the, you know, I, I feel, I feel afraid. Yeah. From what I sense is that the solution he is to have an effective democracy and my worry about something that's such a, uh, an evident operation, aberration operation such as trump such as brexit, is that people

Speaker 2:          51:59          won't

Speaker 1:          52:01          look at what proceeded it. Cause I feel that that's the platform upon which these things rest

Speaker 2:          52:06          for sure. And I think you're right, but I think we have to kind of keep calm. I mean, but without being too kind of platitude in this week, we have to kind of love each other, but we do have to kind of interrogate reality and, and try and make sense of it and tell good stories.

Speaker 1:          52:19          Yes, I think you're right. And you're certainly doing that. Thank you very much for the brilliant work that you've done as a journalist and as a writer and bringing stories that are complex and difficult to understand to a wider audience that it's great work that we're doing. And he's obviously taken a great deal of bravery, particularly what you've undertaken in war conditions and under kind of level of scrutiny in Russia. I don't think I'd enjoy that really freak out. But just to say

Speaker 2:          52:45          the really brave people in the story are there not, not, not people like me with a foreign passport that the Russians or other people in, in, in states where human rights are not so great because they pay a bigger price. Very often they, they take take risks. Some of the people I knew of journalists, politicians have since been kind of murdered. No, I'm not. So, so I, I sort of think we should sort of solute people inside those countries who are trying to

Speaker 1:          53:08          pastry to kind of change things for the better because they're tremendously pray. Thank you very much. Yeah, that's a beautiful thought to end on. Thank you, Luke. Thank you. I really enjoyed, it was good chat, isn't it? That we had, it was great surprise that you've not been asked to read before. Why is that not happening? I think that went out about 20th

Speaker 2:          53:27          no much understand. She's a nostalgic medium. It's a long form interview. I love it. I absolutely love it. Thank you so much for your time, man. Thanks.
