Speaker 1:          00:00:00       My guest on under the skin today is doctor Robin Carhart Harris, the head of psychedelic research at Imperial College London, and he's not even 37 years of age yet. He's already been described as the whiz kid of psychedelic research and imagine how competitive that field is and the cooler, the younger brother of Brian Cox, who we are, and they'll hopefully have only the university did a lovely thing, isn't it? His research is as exciting as it is taboo. He investigates the brain effects and potential therapeutic uses of psychedelic drugs and as such, as the first person in the UK to have legally administered doses of Lsd to human volunteers since the misuse of drug act in 1971. Dr. Robin, thank you for coming on the show. Pleasure. Yeah. Nice to be here. Thanks for inviting me. Oh, you're so kind to say, can I call you doctor? Sure. Although I'm not a medical doctor is going to banks. I don't think of any of that. Anyone that's not a medical doctor I think should be stripped of that title, unless you're wearing a white coat and putting your fingers up people's bomb. I don't consider you part of our system. Thanks Dr. Robin. I'm still have a sufficiently did wish to find titles at lowering doctors, professors, all of that stuff. I'm buying into it and tell me, can you tell me what that means that you are the head of psychedelic research it

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       the empirical what, what's going on for the last few years? I suppose about, uh, eight years now. I've been doing human research with psychedelic drugs. Um, I've done a number of brain imaging studies looking at how these drugs work in the brain. Uh, most recently I've transitioned into, uh, giving a psychedelic for a particular psychiatric disorder to try and treat it as depression and we give psilocybin which is found in magic mushrooms. Um, so now the team is transitioning more into looking at applications and how these drugs can be useful, not just how they work.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       Yeah. Presumably if you're moving to the point of application, some of the efficacy of these substances have been established. Now I'm ragging. Before we get into that, I'd like to learn how someone growing up, you're a British person. I how, how, how did you get into psychedelics? Because there's, it seems to me like a broad and interesting field. Tell me about your academic

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       background and how you became interested in. Well, let's kind of two aspects to the story and perhaps the latter one which is easier to talk about. Happened around my early twenties when I was studying psychoanalysis, so freud and yoga and um, and I was absolutely fascinated by this topic and I couldn't get enough of it and I was, you know, any opportunity reading whatever I could. But I also felt little dissatisfied with where psychoanalysis sat in terms of mainstream psychology. Um, it felt Kinda clickish it felt that's not scientific enough. It didn't seem to have convinced people of the validity of its main ideas, like the existence of the unconscious mind, for example. And I was a believer in some sense, but I didn't want it to have to be that way. I didn't want it to have to be a kind of leap of faith.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       Um, I thought we could maybe demonstrate that certain principles of psychoanalysis a true. And by these principles you mean primarily the existence of an unconscious on an individual level, yes, but also a collective level. So that would be called Young's work, that there's aspects of our psyches that are shared ena, certain themes, certain ways of being certain aspects of the human condition that are enough or, and this is demonstrated what through me motifs and archetype. Yeah. Yeah. Why did you find that so interesting? Well, I think because it felt true because it resonated with me and I think you can see it in culture. You can see it in religion. Um, and, and so I, I kind of wanted to demonstrate that, you know, that there was, that there's real meat here. It's not just, you know, fantasy or the product of our or young's and others, you know, wild imaginations that these things are kind of real.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       For me, this podcast, the reason I do it is to educate myself and to educate others and to try to in some way translate the gap that exists between academia and what you would call normal people or everybody else that doesn't have access to this sort of privileged, a nomenclature of academia of which the word nomenclature is undoubtedly an example. Like, so like when you talk about Freud and young and the psychoanalysis and some of it's like key ideas. Like what is the, it was this distinction between Freud's view of the unconscious and young's view of the unconscious, for example. Yeah. So Freud put most of the emphasis on, on sex, I suppose, and sexuality and also, um, uh, the unconscious, the Freudian unconscious if you want, had much more to do with our own lives, our relationships with important figures in our lives and particularly our parental figures.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       Um, whereas young kind of transcended that level and talked about the unconscious mind with reference to culture and religion and mysticism and so it was a kind of, if you want a sort of deeper aspect of our minds, our unconscious minds, if you want. The young was particularly interested in. He also, there was a bit of a spat between the two figures and young felt. Freud put too much on sex and the personal [inaudible] I can pretty funny marriage or don't get about sex and stop thinking Freud and young does it come by me gasoline? I'm like, so Freud for everything was coming down to sex and your individualized life for young for that there's enough evidence to suggest fruit archetypes and recurring motifs and themes through religions culture to suggest that there's some sort of interconnectivity. Although in Freud's work on like totally museum and to bu they're an indication there that if sort of certain taboos a recurring for about cultures that that in itself is an indication of some sort of collectivized mind.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       I think I touched on it and I think it's a bit of a slightly, you know, oversold differentiation that I just made, you know, and, and Freud was, um, would refer to to kind of collective aspects of the unconscious. Freud was more mechanistic, um, all the young ones as well. I think the difference is a kind of emphasize perhaps too much because of this personal spat between the two and because they kind of emphasize the differences, they emphasize the differences because I suppose we take for granted the things that we share in common and so the differences start to become pertinent and Germane. So from this early interest in unconsciousness, somehow or another, she started to think it was all right to sit around doing drugs, justify yourself. It wasn't really quite that, it was more that, you know, how can we test this stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Um, and, and I was in a seminar one day and, and they were the seminar leader and the people in the group, we're talking about all the different ways that psychoanalysis had to access the unconscious mind. And the best that it could come up with pretty much was dreaming, you know, and dreams are brilliant and fascinating, but the quite unreliable and minor they are now, they are a crap from one page to the next absolute codswallop becoming out of. Okay. So this is the tools of empirical tools for accessing the unconscious, our dreams hypnosis, that sort of like the recognizable tools and what a new thing that those tools are a bit lame. Yeah. Basically. Yeah. And you're and you're not, you know, and has been proven really. You're not gonna convince enough people with those tools because you know, people have said a dreams that they're just chaotic.

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       The noise, they don't mean anything. I'd actually disagree with that. But yeah, that's a popular view that there's, yeah, a lot of young's work on like say for I've written every day about sort of compensate every dreams that they're like, that the unconscious mind is at least trying to narrativize your life or we're trying to communicate with you. And you've talked already about the idea of archetypes. It seems that when we were like, you know, in some senses when we're referring to the transcendent over referring to her, a potent, an all encompassing being, it could in fact be regarded. The, our own unconscious is the repository for great information, great knowledge that we have a kind of a peculiarly unceremonious and inconsistent relationship with these aspects of ourselves. We're absolutely, and this is where psychedelics come in because I stumbled across, kind of stumbled across some literature on lsd being used in psychotherapy in the fifties and sixties.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       And um, I was just blown away to discover that the main rationale for using LSD and psychotherapy was that it would lower ego defenses and then allow access to this, you know, far vaster a realm of our minds, the unconscious mind. And I just thought this is true. Had you taken psychedelics by that time? I'm a bit embarrassed about talking about. Not Embarrassing. It's just a sensitive one in I think because the stigma, stigma, stigma, stigma of being a scientist studying these and the mainstream scientific community, homicides, what? You're doing drugs and then they think you're a hippie. You're not a scientist, she's, yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? But it's in itself a taboo subject and it sort of, its origins, what, who are the early pioneers around psychedelics with Timothy leary or like our oldest Huxley, Ram Dass, that there were a few people who were looking at Mescalin early on in the early 20th century.

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       Uh, but really a breakthrough happened when the Swiss chemist, Albert Hofmann a kind of slightly serendipitously came across lsd and synthesize the lsd while looking for drugs. Um, uh, more to do with, with, with blood and um, and, and, you know, the blood system, he synthesized it. So for, like go, like, so he, he's working away on drive some sort of circuitry trial and these gotta mean drugs or what are they related to? Uh, um, these fungi that grow on certain grasses, he's working with mushrooms and stuff and how, what is it you come to mushroom related and, and, uh, one of the compounds that we synthesize, one of quite a few was Lsd, 25. Um, and uh, the story goes that he got a bit on his skin and somehow you know, ingested it and had this like mild psychedelic trip and then I think the next day he went back and thought, well I'll take a tiny little bit just to see if, if it was this lsd 25 that made me feel so strange.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       So we took 200 mics, which is quite, I think it's 200, 250 is quite a big dose of Lsd and he had a full on, you know, mind blowing a trip full of nightmarish visions and such like, Oh I like that cause it sounds a little bit like the hulk. Then it, he got a little bit on him by accident and then it becomes sort of basically whole course vitamin, whoever, because they all follow that template. Some encounter which is bloody union idea. Okay. And encounter some sort of a mentor encounter and then it becomes another person and goes back next day, next 250 or whatever of it. And he goes into some form, some sort of transcendent realm. Then what am so between the twenties in the sixties and you don't start here, right? So again, really to what fifties and sixties started heating up in the fifties.

Speaker 2:          00:12:19       People started using lsd in really psychoanalytic psychotherapy, which kind of dominated psychiatry. Then the kind of Freudian model really, um, and then into the sixties, things got a bit more colorful and people started taking it recreationally. And then Timothy leary came on the scene. He took some magic mushrooms after reading an article, um, about these tribes in, in Mexico who were taking mushrooms. And then he took lsd and everything changed that he kind of, he was an academic originally. He was at Harvard. He's some sort of Harvard fuddy duddy with Dickie bow tie and a suit on. And before you know it, it's tuned in. Dropout, have a nice relaxed. So this is very curious that like all these substances or substances, this idea seems to exist in indigenous cultures. The idea of, I don't know, sort of shamanism or plant based transcendent experiences is an old idea and perhaps in an original idea and indigenous idea, possibly one of somewhere in the crucible of civilization, we will find this idea where man becomes religious.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Were man begins to believe. Do you think it's as important as that? Is that, what is the basis of your interesting in personally interesting psychedelic? I think there's part of it. So yeah, the therapeutic side and there's a lot of, um, you know, very, um, deep wisdom to those cultures that use, that have used psychedelics for maybe thousands of years. Um, and in a way we're just kind of, to some extent, we're rediscovering what those cultures always knew, but we are bringing something new to the table. I think we're bringing a, you know, um, for all our flaws as sort of a western, um, you know, secular people, uh, we, we do have an ability to break things down, to deconstruct them and to try and understand the mechanisms underneath. And that's important is it to have an understanding of the medicinal and mechanical operation of these chemicals? I think so I'd say, um, I think it's important to understand how something works, you know, some people would argue that it, it makes no difference to me to, to have that knowledge, but I think sometimes there can be some differences, for example, in where people ascribe the locus of action of a drug. So for example, indigenous people might say that it's the plant

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       that holds an intelligence and we tap in through taking the plant. We, we surrender to it and allow its intelligence to guide us that that's the mushroom or the Ios or wherever. Yeah, exactly. Or they may say that it's the songs, you know, these eco rose that sharman seeing these kind of chance that is sung to people while they're under the influence of, of say, I want this jungle psychedelic, um, whether it's wave or a particle somewhere or another is affecting consciousness. Whoever is the wave or the vibration form of the chance or the particularities of the substance will one way or another consciousness is being shifted this way versus particle argument. That what is the essential element? What is it? Is it that there be light? Let there be matter. What is it? What is it about? What happened? View Mate, when you net them bloody drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       I want to know all about it clearly sounds like you know me. I'm in recovery. You don't know me. I'm in recovery. I don't take. I've not had taken any drugs at all and had a drink one day at a time, 14 and a half years. Curiously, Bill Wilson, the founder of 12 step fellowships himself, became very interested in psychedelics for a brief while after he got clean from alcohol and I think hunger your man, Tim leary there for awhile and he wanted to integrate lsd into the 12 steps, which would be an interesting addition. Imagine just kind of finding, finding God, isn't it? Finding really in a sense. Yeah. The twelfth step is having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps. We made a decision to turn out life and will over God and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       So eventually I suppose a life of altruism, philanthropy and service based on this realization now like me, I like, even though I work in media and write children's books, I am prepared to say that like, um, I've taken lsd when I was sort of the first time. I think I was 16 and something very. I mean, it seems. Well, I essentially, when you say like that, it was used in therapy to break down the ego. I can see what people mean because we're the most obvious. The most obvious, most immediate and most tangible thing I experienced was, oh no, I'm not me. I remember thinking that. I remember thinking, I'm not me. I'm not what I thought I was this idea because what I personally felt was very chained to my identity. I'm Russell. I was born at this time. This is what I believe in.

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       I support West Ham united. I like Morrissey, and I remember feeling all that stuff's dismantling in a mirror and like the feeling somewhat afraid. I can see why they would need to be caution, several mini mentorship and guidance when dealing with that. And I suppose in a secular society, clinical conditions is what replaces the idea of ritual or ceremony for Shaman guidance, that sort of businesses. We're taking it laboratory. I'm not doing this in a park with Glen and dean doing assay and staring at the clouds of framing up in a calypso. I slowly made a bloody laboratory. No, I mean in a way. And we take borrow

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       from what's gone before and um, uh, in terms of the sort of semantic model in the sense that we do change the laboratory, you know, we get rid of the fluorescent lighting and there's low thank God and we have, um, we have some nice ambient music in hype, some bloody Pam Power,

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       what you created

Speaker 2:          00:18:15       in the laboratory. Laboratory conditions for psychedelics means what taught me through what the process is. So, um, we'll um, we'll bring in some, some low lighting, um, will a compiler playlists that, that has a certain structure to chat someone up.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       He'd be there tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       Um, and, uh, it's gonna sound worse now, but we built a certain relationship as well, so of trust. It's lovely. Yeah. And we try and get to know each other and kind of lay things on the table and we changed literally romantic objects or no, say in it, an atmosphere of trust and open communication. How many people were at one time in London, England, and just you and one person. How does this work? Uh, usually two people we call them guides or sitters and people are on the level they have not took nothing. Uh, usually they have that moment, that moment. And I know they're sober that the sober guides so visitors', um, and uh, and uh, you know, particularly compassionate and, and encourage a, um, uh, an atmosphere of openness, of a willingness to let go, uh, to explore, um, to surrender that analytical mind, uh, that I was talking about earlier and to trust and to kind of go with the flow of the experience.

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       What substances have you been working with? Psilocybin? Magic mushrooms. So solid. Simon's in magic, mushrooms, lsd a. Now dmt. And I have my colleague next to me, Christian woman who's studying dmt at the moment. I'm an MC as well to help me to understand dmt that's based on that show coming song. I'm quite childish. A hello a Christian woman or you were introduced as a phd student. What you do, Chris. Hello. Welcome. What you're doing your phd in mate in the Phd currently leading a study on trying to find out what are the effects of the brain and kind of like licking experience and brain. You're trying to work out that what have. So tell me what that involves. What are you doing, Chris? Um, so we're basically giving the empty to um, a number of healthy participants. So this young people, students at imperial college

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       primary,

Speaker 4:          00:20:49       not necessarily, I mean you have a wide range of interests that people in our studies and you can have from 20 to 50 years. Fifty year old people. Yeah. Okay. And talk me through the process. So, um, we have to kind of like main phases of the study. So on the first one we wanted to, you know, address, can we give a nice dose of dmt without inducing anxiety, you know, it's such a strong drug that you want to do it in the best possible way, but you want to get the effects that you're after, you want to get to those far out sort of experiences in the best way and safest way possible. So we first did a pilot phase, there was no brain imaging being done and you know, just people were just sitting there and the nice environment just chilling and we gave them different doses of the empty, a nice setting.

Speaker 4:          00:21:44       We saw what happened during the experience. We kind of like a, did interviews, questionnaires kind of like address that in the most detailed way possible, trying to map these effects and experience. Um, and with that we characterize it, will find the right dose. And now we're moving into actually brain imaging, like proper, you know, how many people did you trial to establish what you consider to be the right dose? 12 people. So what did you find across these 12 people? Uh, we found that, um, you got, we tried out three different doses, right, the right dose, the experience characterized, but by the right dose for those kind of like these stages that were, you know, we think are very interesting. So the first one is this kind of like bodily rush, you know, this feeling that people are actually expanding outside of their body somehow.

Speaker 4:          00:22:38       Uh, then this kind of like entering into a geometric sort of space, a very kind of like wonderful, beautiful, colorful, moving geometrical patterns and then pushing through into this kind of like different sort of space, you know, this feeling that you're entering some sort of round that it's not coming from inside, but it's actually, you know, you're visiting somewhere else and in this space, you know, many people in Canada, entities presences that engaged with them, communicate with them. Some receive very meaningful information, some received lake cosmic stuff, spiritual stuff. Other others have like personal insights on their lives. They felt that they were being carried by someone through messages of importance and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       I'm curious, the Corolla Murray, I'm Chris Rather Robin in what Chris is describing in what you said about your interest being triggered by the work of young and Freud and that there is a commonality of experience that people are describing and that one of the early phases of it is transcendence. Would you please just tell me a dmt? What does it stand for? They methylate tryptamine die methyl triptolene. Yeah. From what is this substance derived? It's found in nature and seriousness like plant sources. You can find the actual drug. Uh, we, you know, we buy it from a lab that synthesize it for, you know, a experimental procedures itself, but you can find it in nature. You can find it in the body as well. The human body has the substance in it suggest anything to you there some evidence on it? Yeah. Well we have very, very small amounts so we don't know if it's, you know, if it actually plays a role into any of these naturally occurring spiritual experiences, uh, or if not, or if just maybe some sort of like out product of the system just happening by accident scene.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       And nonessential, I suppose what we're interested in is consciousness, isn't it? The nature of consciousness, what is this that's happening to us? What is being, what is it to experience the information conveyed to us through the senses and to see ourselves as the sort of participant in and all three of our own reality. So anything that can significantly disrupt the manner in which we understand reality has potentially profound implications for us as a species for the way that we civilize, socialize an organized one can see why it's a substance that's been heavily controlled since its inception in the sixties when people were working with Lsd, there was a point where it began to be sort of quite heavily policed, controlled a band.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       Is that true? Yeah. Yeah. And in, in the late sixties, um, a number of states in the US started to, to make it illegal essentially. Um, and uh, the research was effected by implication. Really it was, it then became not impossible, but very difficult to do the research. And actually at one stage it did become impossible. Then I'm a regulatory. People were coming round and confiscating psychedelics. And so there was a very rapid, I'm about turn in, um, Rooney Society's perspective on, on psychedelics,

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       what was happening in America in the late sixties, maybe of interest with regard to controls on a experimental hallucinogens in soccer.

Speaker 2:          00:26:11       That takes mean there was a lot going on culturally in terms of the counter culture. And I think there was some fears that maybe lsd was fueling some of that political.

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       Yes. He's quite likely, isn't it? If there was a sort of a civil rights movement, Vietnam War, the emergence of counterculture, the ideas of the beats start to become in a sense politicized like these, like the eastern mysticism is now like goes through the conduit of American literature and poetry and starts to become a kind of socializing and politicized form is whether it's an artistic form and one can in a perhaps a not intubate but conject that if society is an agreement, if people start looking at society differently, more consciousness differently or themselves differently, that potential for change is suddenly dramatically enhanced. Do you think that that's possibly why these substances were controlled rather than people are worried about, I don't know, dental care or whether or not people are all right? I think so. You know, in some ways you could characterize it as the, the youth becoming more conscious and less conformist, more questioning.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       That's exactly what they were doing. Whether they were doing that anyway or whether the psychedelics are actually fueling those changes because of this idea that psychedelics broadened consciousness. There's an interest in. I'm a fan of Terence Mckenna, who's, I suppose like a, they're one of the great pioneers, isn't he? One would say of sort of this sort of plant based studies, but also like for you guys who are academics, he must be sort of a controversial figure and one of the things we have this podcast is I become aware that there are sort of sanctioned academics and then these people are like, oh yeah, right. That guy type people. And like, uh, an. Even though I'm a great admirer of territory medics, I think he so lucid and vivid and brilliant articular imaginary sort of for profit in a sense like that. I've picked up that there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       He's on the side of the fence of what let's not British types of stuff. You know the thing about Terence Mckenna is he. He's a fascinating personality, a great speaker at with incredibly interesting ideas. Now, whether that's true or not is another is another question and my view is that the jury's out really on a lot of his ideas and what the meaning of truth is and Bill Hicks, like one of the Great Comedians have a 20 a couple of decades ago. Like he sort of. He said, okay, I think, I'm guessing maybe got this from a or maybe from your field this way you guys are experts for like a shaman is a misery sort of psychedelic plants are like an agent of evolution in that is it has an impact on consciousness and our conscious experience. Now I'm guessing Chris, mate, from what you're saying about like these experiments you've done, that you've had a little go at that dmt yourself now if you don't mind, can you tell me exactly what happened? His face because I'd like to know all about it from the process of how it's imbibed to what happens to your mind and if you can describe the experience using so blunted tool as language. I'd like you to do it so, so just going through it again from when you get a hit on the pipe and then what happens in your brain and not like from a screen from, from experiencing it.

Speaker 4:          00:29:26       Yeah. So it all begins with this intense, very, very intense rushing the body, you know, there's this kind of like it feels like this very strong flow of energy going through. You know, what people describe how much she piping

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and say you're putting it on a foil on a bottle and go, hey, people usually do. Yeah. How you doing? Because he's in a university. Does it look a little bit less under the bridge? Uh, well yeah. I mean I can, but rather not. You think the mechanics of it are worrying, are they, it worries you guys to talk about it? Not really. No. No, but we give it intravenously so it's not, it's not like a needle in a needle. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then so you like, so you give people a little and if you take it, do you take it intravenously or do you smoke it? If I would have to take. Is there an eagle you're worried about illegal stuff or professional stuff? Oh yeah. Okay. If you hypothetically, let's say hypothetically, you know, how would you define it?

Speaker 4:          00:30:33       Smugged would be the easiest.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       I'd worry about the old lungs on that. I'd probably go straight for the straight for the old main system brought into the brain and to the nape of the neck. I'd like it. I'm like, no, but I don't do drugs and I think, you know, like as a person in recovery, I think you have to be very careful though. There's a lot of talk that psychedelics can influence addictive behaviors and issues around dependencies. It's a very, very interesting area when it comes because I, my personal belief is the addiction stems from trying to solve a spiritual, emotional, psychological issue for external mean to have that sexual behavior or average extreme behaviors around food or gambling or but most notably and obviously dependency and reliance on alcohol and drugs. Now I don't see how someone could become dependent on this experience where first of all, you feel a tremendous rush on the body. Then you have some experience of geometry suggesting that geometry is one of the archetypal things that exist. I didn't Greeks were on to something that geometry is actual ways of energy and shapes and performing and then after that you go into what some domed realm where there appear to be entities communicating with you and what do people say these? Tell me about that bit.

Speaker 4:          00:31:42       That's a very interesting thing. I mean there's this kinda like there was this transition from the space of the geometries into this actual kind of like, you know, different sort of space, different realm that feels alive and it feels very true as well. For many people. I mean, if the dose is high enough, you know, people kind of reliably go into this space and this space can be full of color, different objects. Not necessarily. You will get the same sort of like shapes NTT. Some people speak about alien, so people speak about Goblin. Some people don't even speak about visual evidence entities. Just something being alive around you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       Yes, because I suppose that would be interpretive. A friend of mine, he's been on this podcast, Simon amps still using a British comedian. He said that when he. He like with his experience with Ios guy that he said that he's described that the different people in the group, he was in a group out of six people, he said and like, Hey, as a sort of a secularized Jewish person, a experienced these guiding psychiatrist and there was a Hindu person who hadn't experienced with Ganash and a Christian person who had Christ like divinity needs an Avatar. The divine comes to you in the form of a, of an image, which is really just a form of geometry, I suppose, loose geometry, but like everyone's having the same essential experience of there is there is an authority, there is something accessible to consciousness. Which you said there Chris and you said also Robin, maybe external may not be. Yeah. Well of course you're seeing Jesus. You just took it. You just injected yourself with a big arm full of delicious. What? Demo method. Triptolene

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       they methylate tryptamine. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       Say what? What is this? Why do people think it might be external because of the consistency of the experience.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       It's an. It's an interesting. Definitely an interesting question. I mean, the thing is that it's always a drug. You know, it's an actual thing. Entering your body, you know, costing these experiences, the feeling, the experience of your wheel. I mean feels three wheel and it's. I think it's definitely something to respect people. People feel there's some authority. There's something external, something that you knew or bow down in some sort of way you respect deeply. That being said, I'm not necessarily, you know, it is something real or that something that exists to actually outside of realm of personal experience, we don't know these things. It's difficult. It's difficult to access them from a scientific point of view, you know, most, most, most things around. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       Inside of us, you know, most, most things, most objects, you know, most entities are outside of us. And even when we dream, we think we're in a world where things are outside of us, you know, but we know that, that um, uh, you know, play if you want is being played out in our minds and we know that there are changes in brain activity that account for it. And it's a similar thing with psychedelics. I mean, we know, you know, with very high reliability that they work on a particular aspect of the brain that they work on a particular neurotransmitter system, a particular receptors, serotonin receptor, if you block it, you don't trip, you don't see the entities to really all the evidence is that it comes from the brain. It comes from the mind. But there's a thing that humans do, which they, they have an inclination to do, which is to kind of externalize, know to project and say it's out there. The realm is, is real, it's another dimension. You know, these entities are actually aliens that come from wherever. So we've become certainly in a way overly sensual and overly materialistic. It becomes our main interpretive tool is to regard phenomenon is external as opposed to internal possibly could continually go to bias to see things have this bias of externalizing and materializing. Why do we have this bias? Why do we have it?

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       Alright? And I'm interested in so many things here. Mostly getting out of my neck, I'd always have to be very, very careful. I've got

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       great deal of respect and indeed fear of drugs because of the way that it made my life go or really, really badly wrong. But like what I'm interested in, I sort of thing I think is the exploration of this world now. When you would, under these clinical studies, if illusions in the studies that yourselves, that you were conducting and in previous studies, what part of the brain is being impacted and what can we learn from that? Yeah, well it starts with the serotonin system and the molecules come in Serotonin, where else would we see that effect? But there's loads of it in the gut. Um, but we've got a lot of, in our brains. There isn't such a massive, you know, there's a kind of relationship with those, with those systems. And people talk about visceral feelings this or is. Yeah, exactly. Gut Instinct. Um, so yeah, so serotonin is in the brain and it modulates arrange range of different things, states of consciousness, sleep, mood, the way we think.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       And psychedelics kind of hijack the serotonin system in a certain aspect of it. And then kind of pickle a particular way it seems, right? Cheeky little devil doesn't it again in there to away on the systems. And uh, and then at the kind of broader level in terms of the whole of the brain that changes networks in the brain. And that's the way we tend to think about brain function these days. We don't think of all this bit here does this, you know, it's like this distributed system that often encompasses the whole of the brain with bits at the front and bits at the back. Yeah. No. Does something like know vision or movement or. Yeah. This model of compartmentalization likely come from the period of industrialization. That of which a lot of these discoveries were made in when we saw mechanistic models as being compartmentalized and as we realized a time where our technology is understood in terms of cybernetics, that we start to look at consciousness and the brain as a comparable entity.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       It's unlikely that he was looking out the window button, go to the toilet tree. Instead, the, as DMRC would say, just the mind rules the body. Does the body roll the mind? I've done a little bit circular. Yeah, right. There's one. Where are these? Where are these boundaries? Where are these lines? Who's drawing them in and for what reason? Okay. So like one of the things that happens is serotonin transmission and reception starts going all I knew real well, and that that creates a conditions of, of plasticity or a potential for change. Um, and you know, in those kind of looser conditions, the constraints on brain function, the way the brain's working, um, are, are sort of lifted and the brain can operate in a much freer away. And what happens under those conditions is the brain networks that we know, that we know serve different functions like vision, like moving, like, like high level things, like even consciousness.

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       They begin to break down, they begin to dissolve and disintegrate. And when they do that, another interesting thing that happens when you look at the whole of the brain is that these systems become less, uh, different from each other. They kind of start to blend in to each other and those two things. So the disintegration of networks and the kind of coming together of networks and the sort of blending relate. Uh, so we've seen. And so we think to some of the kind of most abstract aspects of the experience. So one of them is a, these reports of ego dissolution that you were talking about earlier, you know that that sense that your narrative self, you know who Russell is, is being compromised and you're just as awake just as consciousness, but all of a sudden that narrative self destruct away and the other one is that you might feel when that happens, first of all, a fear, but also if that's transcended a sense of connecting to something bigger in a sense of connectedness, a sense of oneness.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       That's interesting. So the ego one's idea of a narrative it self as sort of a physical entity with a story and a life in a perspective. When that dissolves, there's a sense of connection and relief and release that I do remember I took it I think quite a lot for a while and sometimes it felt very brilliant and beautiful and I enjoyed it. But remember I wasn't taking it under laboratory conditions. I was taking it under the probably the worst conditions you could take it under ethics in the first case is. And then sort of like hanging out in like sort of people's bedsits in new cross gate and like with people with themselves, just young men and like you know, that sort of 18 year old lads and for example, it's not the worst thing that ever happened to me and check this out.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       Like everyone sort of got a load of acid, like sheets of the staff and I obviously as a very keen young drug user for that are left that and went and swapped my bike for a good sheet of it and like everyone pretended one night that they were all doing some and they all just get a little bit of paper which is the form that it was delivered in and I took real acid but they only had a bit of paper in an hour in as Mike tripped kicking in. They all go, guess what? We didn't take acid. So I'm now on a trip that requires, as you said, in laboratory conditions, trust release and all of that. And I'm told that none of the rest of them are doing it. Man. I was not happy that day. I didn't like it because I was starting like, you know, my, again, I'm a, yeah, I'm an adolescent male so my identity is forming. My ego is a fragile thing. Anyway, coming from the background that I came from and you know, I remember like feeling very, very disruptive and very, very frightened and very afraid. I mean so that these psychedelic drugs and not things to be toyed around with lightly. But I think there's sort of this general awareness and sort of. I'm a big fan of Daniel Pinchbeck. He writes

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       a lot about sort of taken different plant by plant medicines and stuff and different cultures and stuff. Uh, I think that there's important and potentially revolutionary information held in these plant substances.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       I agree with that and people have said the psychedelics are kind of, you know, there are kind of apart from other drugs and there's a bit of evidence to support that. So for example, this big population study in theU , s looked at united some 200,000 people and then looked at patterns of drug use and the relationship to mental health and found the psychedelics stood out like a sore thumb because all other drugs, the more you take the worse your mental health. But psychedelics, the more he took the lower was psychological distress and the lower was suicidality. The two measures that they looked at. So people have questioned whether you can even call psychedelics recreational drugs because at least in principle they should have been taken for recreation. Maybe self exploration or therapeutic work but not, you know, not a party or

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       whatever. Yeah, because I remember black, my impulse in taking those substances when I was in fact in all drugs, I want it to get out of myself. I've felt like trapped and him sort of in pain and like also the other thing curiously that felt is what we're experiencing is reality is not the ultimate reality. There's something else I wanted that. So I kept puffing loads of weed then drinking loads and doing enough for drugs and eventually I'm going to crack and heroin addict, but the thing that had this odd transcendent and what do I want to say, sort of like uncanny, almost macabre. I feel it even when we're talking about it, when I start to feel this, the tendrils that connects me to my personal self flexing and being tugged because something in me knows there is another world and it's difficult because it's the domain primarily of religion to say that the material world is an illusion. None of this stuff really matters. We're all one. These tropes are found in religion. Now what you're doing is bringing these ideas are exploring these ideas in academia and in chemistry and he, and it seems it's sort of somewhat laden with taboo and prohibition. Even within your field I've sent you, you're both cautious about talking about it in a personal way. Why? Well, it's a lot different aspects there. But uh, you know, uh, I guess, um, I mean the stigma is a massive thing. And uh, and it's like we're kind of

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       walking a very thin line, you know, you've got the enthusiasts, so on one side the psychedelic enthusiastic that might look in and say, oh, these guys are so dry, the such, you know, such scientists, you know, they're boring or whatever, and then you've got the way that I like. Yeah. And then we've got the, you know, the mainstream, on the other hand, you look in and think, oh, they're not real scientists. They study psychedelics, they must be hippies. I bet they'd take closer psychedelics. So there's a really sort of difficult line to walk and personally, you know, a major motivation is to try and broaden that walkway in a way, you know, to kind of eat into some of the mystical aspects. And although people won't like this kind of secularized them and, and I don't see that as a threat, although some people will see it as kind of bridge building, um, and translation like it really needs to be a Rosetta stone of the spiritual experience to the material experience because materialism is our dogma.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       How are we going to get information over? Yeah. And if you make it dogmatic, but, you know, personally I wouldn't ever want to depreciate things like an entity experience and I think something, but sometimes people are threatened by it and think, oh, you're trying to explain away this experience that changed my life or whatever, and, and say, you know, you want to say it's all brain activity and I don't personally, I don't want to do that at all. I'd rather allow that way of looking at things to just sit. I suppose, you know, motivation would say. I think it's interesting to understand how the hell it happens, you know? Um, and so for me it's not explaining away, it's just explaining. It's a bit like, you know, the wonder of nature. It still is magical and beautiful, you know, um, whether you understand how, how a tree grows or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       That's right. And regard and however far one goes materialistically mechanistically for whichever scientific discipline one is still left with the question of, well, how, why? What's motivating this in, what is it Ctda what in thrones this procedure? And I think you're right, I agree with you entirely that the more that there can be description and translation of these ideas, the more it will benefit it's advanced. What's your personal motivation in carrying out these studies? What do you want to do? What do you want to achieve? Education is one thing. Like I'd like it to be more normalized and, and less, um, I don't know. Easter terrick, you know, the unconscious mind that it be something that's taught to kids even, you know, I think that will help to broaden our population's consciousness. Talk about unconscious unconscious in a way. You know, we were talking about indigenous cultures.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       Maybe they have some of that, you know, and often quite healthy cultures. Um, you know, it's, it's less taboo and maybe some of that kind of parcel eating is something that the western people have done, you know, particularly sort of, you know, zealously. Yeah. Uh, and so there's a motivation to normalize A. I don't want psychedelics, the vso esoteric. I don't want the unconscious mind and psychoanalysis to be so unusual and taboo and stigmatized, you know, there is a motivation to, to bring it into the mainstream and to, you know, get people talking about it and thinking

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       about it and I think in being more conscious for ourselves, we're less likely to perhaps harm ourselves and others. God, that's a very beautiful and important idea. I'm intrigued by it because I feel that we are all to content to dismiss activity that we all experience, like we all do dream every night. This amazing thing that happens in everyone's mind most days and just go, oh, crack on. Pay The gas bill. I'll know mortgage rates have gone up for let's have another foreign war. And every night all of us tumble into some glorious world of wonder where our own life is rerender there's a myth and that the information that's in there is somehow ignored. And that the fact that there is obviously sort of potential to understand ourselves differently. A book that I have written is it about, you know, sort of is about how my method of recovery that I was given the 12 step method was a way of recognizing that the model I had of myself was ineffective, was an ineffective way of living and that I needed to go on a journey of being a different kind of man to succeed in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:48:40       And my sense is that prohibition around philosophy, prohibition around substances. I know I find it very difficult to regard the state, particularly when you talk about this period of inception in the sixties, is as parental and loving when so many of its aims and objectives have been subsequently revealed to be the mendacious. So is there like it's likely that prohibition around psychedelics shares that objective, but if more people experience this and it was probably like shamanism, culturally is not for everybody. Not everybody in the tribe goes off every bloody day and wanders around in theory, all realms and in the unconscious mind and is expected to interpret it. Different types of people have different types of abilities, but some people should be experiencing different aspects of the unconscious and all of us should have a different way of relating to ourselves in totality, not just, oh well I'm just this boat.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       And then like deathbed lives, I should have done more by. I'd love me. I just simply couldn't cope. So like, um, like what is the, tell me, what is the ongoing, ongoing intention for these studies? What's going on? Well, we do more clinical work. Um, we're looking at psilocybin magic mushrooms as a treatment for depression and we, we've done that already and got an idea that it works and some idea of how it works, but now probably. But that serotonin stuff, right? It's Serotonin and it works on those networks I was talking about earlier. Um, and um, and, and sort of reset mechanism as well. It seems to be going on, you know, that's curious what like the narrative can be interrupted thing. No, I'm not, it's not happening now. I'm not being abused now. I suppose you can kind of scramble up and dissolve

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       it, but it comes back, you know, but it comes back like a malfunctioning computer is rebooted and it comes back and it's functioning again normally. Um, yeah, that's something to test more as we go on. But it's a, have you had some negative stuff then having to have somebody go proper crackers? Yes, absolutely. Well, um, it can be nightmarish. We, you know, we can have patients whaling during the session when they're literally, you know, facing demons and, and you know, our, when they come back and they go, oh, it was terrible. This thing got me where I was abused as a kid and that just really lived it. I know that, that kind of thing. Um, and uh, and so they need to feel like they can go there and this has literally happened that killed himself or anything mad. Yeah. No, no, not, not, not that, but the experience itself is incredibly challenging.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       I can imagine it being traumatic. I've experienced it to be traumatic staring around in your own unconscious. It's going to be traumatic. There's all sorts of crap mine around in there and addressed, but like, you know, just someone having a traumatic time ain't necessarily a negative thing because at least you're living it and, and there can be breakthrough and so this is a thing and we encourage the patients to look the demons in the eye and sometimes those demons are kind of manifestations of an abuser say and when they do that they get this curious like shift in perspective and they'll see the abuser as a, almost as a victim, you know, that they can sort of see the chain of causality that led to them, you know, being so you know, damage that they would do something damaging. These results can be achieved therapeutically.

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       Also, sort of the reframing in sort of say neuro linguistic programming would be about like looking at the perpetrator of abuse as themselves. As you say a victim like that, you know, that you cook, but I'm imagining you could probably do that a lot quicker with a healthy dose of psilocybin. People say that, you know, famously said about psychedelics that they can be like years of therapy, you know, in a few hours. The danger is you always feel like we should put a caveat on it because we talked a lot about the environment and the context and I do think it's true that you know, in, in the wrong context, psychedelics could be harmful. Person was mentally unwell in inverted commerce is probably not a good idea to take any mind altering substances alone. And I think my personal belief is that the addiction phenomena is a result of people medicating themselves in a society that doesn't know how to treat them and has no real desire to take care of the mentally ill. I was smoking weed, I was drinking because I was in pain and I couldn't cope. And curiously the other thing is I already said was I had a powerful curiosity about what was going on in my mind, my experience. A colleague of mine, a Rosalind Watson has done some nice work around this theme of connectedness. You know, in a lot of mental disorders and probably addiction. You know, people suffer from a feeling of being isolated and being disconnected from things and they might be disconnected or say for meaning

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       united does a sense of meaninglessness and what seems to happen with psychedelics when, when there is a breakthrough, is that people feel this strong sense of reconnection. I'd like to know on a personal level what experience used to have of people in recovery taking these subsidiaries because I'm in recovery. I'd like to know about people with five, 10, 15, 20 years plus in recovery from drugs and alcohol using these substances and they're not going off and relapse in and holding up a gas station and kicking over some bins on their way out of the lab there. There's no evidence that psychedelics promote relapse. And, and like I was saying earlier, they're, they kind of are sort of, uh, you know, drugs apart from other drugs in a way, you know, they're not more wish than not addictive in themselves. In fact, after psychedelic experience, people often say either never again or not for awhile. You know, even if it's, if it's transformative and euphoric, um, they usually have to go through a tough time to get there. So they're not hedonic drugs really, you know, they're not hedonic. Right. Cool. Hi. Tell us some of your greatest hit. Some of the things people have seen, some of the things people have come back with. Gosh, Chris too.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       Yeah. So, uh, okay. I have one of our last participant, uh, she, you know, she was going through the pace of the place of the geometry you see pushed through, but she couldn't push through any further because there were some, you know, is not letting her go by and somehow a bit kind of like punishing her because of the audacity of going into this realm. Right. Um, so that was quite scary for her. Right. So this kind of like first entity encounter, but then slowly, slowly she started, you know, kind of like going through this haze of clouds. Uh, and then they were entities like chanting all around her and healing her as she came back from the experience.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       Oh Man. Yeah. No. Unless the clinical conditions and the clinical conditions. I'm still undecided because I live my life one day at a time. Wow. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? I mean even just the idea that there's things in your unconscious mind. I mean dreams are in themselves. Evidence. You don't need to take drugs to see that there's stuff going on in your unconscious mind that you don't know about. In fact, just look at your own hand right now. Some things pumping blood into it in not conscious mind isn't deciding, so we're. We are continual evidence of our own unconscious activity. But for me, the idea of these narratives and this idea of external phenomena being experienced not via the material world or the central world, but via some kind of other tellier journey. Is that the right word? Some other teleology like there is momentum and receipt of data without going through the material world.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       I liked the sounds of that very, very much because that seems like, you know, like people say, the reason the world's not changing is because of a lack of vision because no one's got a better idea. You know that we live in a political age, risk forms of management and shift of a percent here or there, but the things that are interesting in politics or about kindness and love and compassion and oneness and socialism is just, we're all one. We should look after each other and I suppose capitalism is just do the bloody best jacare where water got so like the idea that there could be new data, new information and empirical. So that's what I think is important that you're building material, mechanical, empirical bridges because the idea that there is another vision within each of us, another way of being, another version of yourself waiting to be realized.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       That's pretty exciting, isn't it? Anything else? If you've got anything else for me and you have stories of stuff you've seen. What about when Terence Mckenna is saying that he's seeing and like, I like this idea about like some of the things I heard two things on youtube I liked. One was a Peruvian Shaman who like, uh, you know, obviously I've worked with plants in his capacity as a shaman being given dmt in clinical conditions. And he described exactly as you did that like, you know, bodily sensation, the sensation of fort speeding up. Then the idea then thought stopping then this sort of personal sense of death of like, Oh my God, they've ruined the, messed up the dosage, I'm gonna die. And then realizing like that, that's in fact personal death or death of the ego. And then sort of encountering other entities. I love that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       I love the sound of that to me. Absolutely. Bloody terrific. One of the things he talked about is the loss of time that he said that on his way back from the experience, if it goes off, probably been gone for thousands of years. Hope there's some of my descendants alive came back and he sort of said to the conditions or anyone alive and. Well yeah, everyone's been gone 10 minutes mate. So like a dmt experience is what, like this is 10 minutes or something. Yeah, there's actually much less intense but intense Buddhist like five minutes or even three, five minutes. You are in a realm where sort of the rules of the material world and the physical world seemed to abate and you experience things that are beyond your own understanding, beyond your own limitations of consciousness. One of the things I liked that Terence Mckenna said, if, uh, if you, if those were to land on the White House South Lawn, it will be less impressive than what's happened happened in your own consciousness. Your own consciousness on dmt reveals to you. But everything. We understand the limitations and prohibitions as the material and physical world are, but one frequency of being but one modem of reality within us all. There's this sort of different potentiality. An interesting interesting. We don't have, I don't have a Bunsen burner or the beaker full of alkaline think. It's interesting. It's like this break down enough to where you're seeing the world. I mean this

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       is a really interesting thing and you mentioned that at some point. I mean this idea of transitioning into another mode of being can be very healing in itself as well. And I think this is something that's really striking about the experience and why, you know, people build this very intense narrative around them as well.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Yeah. You know, you could tell already that, um, we've got a slight bias, or at least speaking for myself, I have the, you know, the, it even though it might feel like you transcend the physical and material, uh, I'm not sure what to do because there's no real evidence for that. And what is the physical material in these terms, you know, what would it mean to transcend it? Maybe it's just the experience of totality that the idea, even the paradigm or the template that suggests material and transcendence of material, is it materialistic or a limited idea? I suppose psychologically things have a psychological reality that in a way, um, you know, or a different way of looking and understanding things. Then then looking at the biology and know, looking at the biology is a, is an objective perspective and you look at, yeah. Whereas, you know, this other perspective of feeling of experiences inherently subjective and it's hard.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       It is hard to reconcile those things. So they're, in a way, there is a sort of started to get a bit philosophical with terms, but like an inevitable journalism, you know, that there is a psychological reality to these experiences that you can't, and patsy shouldn't try and explain a way with biology, but you can let them both sit next to each other and say when I, you know, I do know what maps onto that feeling and that experience, there's not, you know, and then you know it and if you want to try and, you know, shatter a present sort of paradigms in science and, and, and you have this belief hypothesis that actually these breakthroughs into another realm are actually literally true and that you know, that there are other dimensions and such like, then you've got a hypothesis and you can go ahead and try and test it. You know, we haven't, we haven't done that yet.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Leave something in there and I bring something back from it. Um, yes, that's interesting what I'm talking a lot. We mentioned at the beginning the idea of a collective unconscious. One of the, perhaps the defining union idea is there in the work that you've done with psychedelics over your professional lifetime, is there an interesting consistency across substances and of course experiences that suggest that there is a commonality to the conscious experience of people using these

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       substances? Wow. Um, yes, but I'm, and I guess one unifying, uh, um, aspect of the experience is this feeling of, Oh my God, you know, myself was a construction, you know, that it, that it was built up that it's not absolutely real. You know, I think that's one thing that's, that's common to everyone and then when that is transcended another common experiences that, um, the role,

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       wow. No one wants that drug. The, Oh, we're all one drug. You better go to work. I'm afraid I'm not going to pay your mortgage. Why you need to achieve more. For what reason? I mean, it certainly presents a lot of questions that might be challenging to keeping a population behaving in a certain way. Is it very, very. There's a lot of interesting stories and I don't think they're a ttl, uh, under the skin. A name of this show has ever been more pertinent because a subcutaneous glance at these inner world suggests the potential for huge, huge change. I'm so grateful to both of you, Robin and Chris for coming in and explaining, albeit in some cases tentatively, but importantly very professionally and I think still within the confines of academia, something that sounds like a wonderful, wonderful mystery and when the Great Brian Cox talks about physics is the mystery and the wonder and the glory and our attempts to understand and explain it this fascinating in all forms of discipline, but when it comes to consciousness itself, not just one more phenomena, but the crucible of all phenomena is deeply, deeply fascinating.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       So thank you both of you very much. Been a pleasure. Really cool. Really cool.
