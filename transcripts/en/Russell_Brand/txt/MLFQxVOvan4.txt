Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello and welcome to this special edition of under the skin with me Russell brand. I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr. Jordan Peterson. I've spoken to him before, but this special commemorative does not really a commemorative chat. It's not a tea towel for the raw wedding between Meghan markle and Prince Harry. It's a to celebrate the release on paper back of my book recovery and look at it now on Amazon. It's six pound 50, I think might be six pound 47 we talk about that book recovery. We talk about the principles of recovery as a road twin light meant we talk about Dr Peterson's book. 12 rules for life is an interesting chat talking about myth. We do of course go for some of the main stays of Professor Peterson's, a Canon of ideas that he commonly talks about, but also I think we really get to the heart of it and discover some, uh, some people think there's an exclusion of warmth. I think sometimes when talking about Peterson ideas and these, I'm insistent on individual culpability and responsibility. We get into that stuff quite deeply. I think it's a great chat. Those. You don't know who Jordan Peterson is yet? Where, where have you been? Obviously not watching him at the Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000 others. So yeah, we were talking to Jordan Peterson and under the skin. Thanks for joining me and do check out my book recovery on paperback. Thank you

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       Dr. Jordan Peterson. Thank you for coming on under the skin. It's lovely to see you again. It's good to see you too. It's nice to meet in London. Yeah, it's different isn't it? We have, both of us were exiled in Los Angeles in our last conversation by enjoyed it very much. I've got a lot from it. I'm happy to talk to you on. This is very much home turf for me. Now we're in London, we're in a publishing office. You've been promoting your book, I presume that's why you're here. [inaudible] and doing a public couple of public lectures. How do you find that now? How do you finding what I thought in a way, I've been comparing you to the British opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing this for ages and now you're experiencing a, uh, an almost, perhaps unprecedented level of attention, but I'm assuming that your skillset is applicable.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       You're a lecturer, you're a clinical psychoanalyst, so it's not like, oh my God, there's cameras. Right, right. Well, I mean, the, the large scale lectures aren't doing, aren't that much different in kind from the lectures I was doing at the university. I mean, the venues are larger and yeah, but the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats, I think maybe, yeah, there were 5,000 at the Apollo. Well, that's where you're not nervous. Um, I'm not as nervous doing that as I am often going to talk to journalists. Individual journalists. Yeah. Because like the thing about those venues, there's a variety of things about them that worked in my favor. I mean, I like talking to crowds, you know, I've always enjoyed lecturing and so

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       lecturing to several thousand people isn't much different than lecturing to several hundred people. But I also know that the people who've come are there happy to be there. Like I'm, I'm, I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and so, and it's all, all of the details are essentially under my control so, so it's not it I am actually enjoying it quite a bit. I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand because, well because you should be, you know, I want to do a good job and I want to make sure things go well and I want to get through the material properly and, and, and get a little farther in my thinking than I have been and I'm trying to make each time I lecture better than the last time and I don't, obviously I do always don't succeed at that but, but it's good. I'm enjoying it and my wife is very good travel companion.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       She's very stable and she helps me plan my days and so we've got it down to a bit of a routine. I would say Tammy is in the room with us. We've already met previously in Los Angeles. You wouldn't be on mine. There isn't in my back. It's a just in case listeners are wondering why perhaps they might be able to detect in my voice. I'm occasionally glancing towards a spouse. The reason is because I am now, well, I'm curious, when you're, um, doing these lectures, him, he's there not a performance component. Do you not feel like, definitely, yeah. Well, sure. I mean a lecture theater is a theater, you know, and lecture is a form of theater. Now it's a serious form of theater. But theater can be serious, you know, and, and there's a seat because partly what I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas to an audience, but I'm also modeling the act of engaging with ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       And that's the theatrical end of it. And I don't give the same talk twice. Like I have my stories and I have my collection of things I know and I talk about, but I try to, I try to do two things. Um, I try to, I'm always talking to specific individuals in the audience and so I'm having a conversation with the audience. And so that's, that's part of the dynamic element of the performance. And the other thing I'm trying to do is to further my thinking on the topics that I'm addressing. And there is a theatrical element to that because it's, it's like, I think the closest thing really that it compares to is probably stand up comedy. Although I think the routines that comedians have are probably more well and formally practice than the ones that, that you know, than, than the, than the talks that I, that I engage in. And I don't really think of it as delivering a lecture to an audience. I'm trying to think about complicated things in real time with an audience there to participate and to use the audience as an indicator of whether what I'm saying is gripping and comprehensible. You apprehension and, and uh, understandable. Adrenaline prior to going on stage doesn't lead you to lean into a shtick, you know, which would be the opposite of what you're describing to remain

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       engaged in a kind of dialectic process of discovery. Because I find, I mean obviously I am a comedian, so yeah, for us I would argue there is a, there is a distinction between performing for before 200 people or 5,000 people around 200 I feel like I'm very relaxed, I'm comfortable. I feel like I've got a lot of space in there. 5,000 I feel like sharpen up now you've got no room particularly because the other crucial difference is I, there needs to be a laugh every 2030 seconds. If there isn't, it gets pretty frosty up there. He said it is appealing to me as a comedian. That's interesting. Interested in furthering intellectual debate, looking at their new intersections between politics and spirituality. Perhaps they've always been there. These are some of these evaporating context, the emergence of new ideas perhaps best exemplified by your own particular trajectory.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Is it interesting to me that these spaces are now becoming available for forms of types of performance that aren't so contingent? It is on rapture her an opinion or what? Right, and I know it is a very strange thing and I'm not sure what to make of it. You know, you see Sam Harris doing something quite similar. Richard Dawkins is doing something quite similar and, and it's, I mean I was thinking because I've been trying to conceptualize this and, and one, one comparable audience or one comparable situation is probably that of of standup comedians. Another I suspect are traveling events, even evangelical types because there but, but of course what they're doing is explicitly religious. This is it. This has elements of both of those. And what's emerging that's so interesting is that there's a clear public appetite for high level intellectual conversation. If it's, if it's dynamic and I don't know what, what's accounting for that all of a sudden, maybe it's because these sorts of discussions aren't taking place.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       Like they should in the classical media space. You might be right there. Jordan, I mean to slightly mangle to slightly mangled the young quote that you use in your book. Um, 12 rules I'm really enjoying actually, uh, like the one could infer motivation from results perhaps is that the political discourse, social discourse has become superficial and detached from meaning from purpose, from experience. That there is an opening appetite for substance, that people are starting to what you know. And, and, and as you said about theater before, you know, the origins of theater and the origins of religion a closely connected and both of them still our debt or at least functionally must relate to meaning purpose, giving us stories that help the

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       path. I think that, I think that's, that's that's there's something about that that's profoundly correct. I think that, you know, that the New York Times has recently written about the rise of the so called intellectual dark web, which is a term that Eric Weinstein so brilliantly coined, I would say. And, and very thoughtfully. Um, I think that the thing that unites the people who are loosely grouped into that collection is that they are having serious conversations with an audience that they respect. And they're very diverse range of people. They don't certainly don't like salmon. Sam Harrison, I disagree about many things, for example. And uh, but Sam respects his audiences and he's, and he's engaging them in extremely serious discourse about very deep topics now about the structure of reality actually. And, and the relationship between science and religion and, and, and the, and I think it is a consequence of the fact that not only has our public discourse, let's say in the media and in politics become shallow.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       I think it's become unbearably shallow in the universities. So, yeah. Well, because it's become so ideological, you know, and it's just not helpful. Look, I was interviewed by a New York Times journalists last week. Uh, Nelly was her name and she's going to publish this on Sunday and she did a literature degree at Columbia. And she told me that she was quite appalled actually by her degree. Uh, especially in, in, in hindsight, she told me that she didn't know until she graduated, that there was any other way of reading great literature then through a postmodern Lens. And the postmodern lens takes a book and basically you take a book, whatever it happens to be, and you decide which power hierarchy the author was serving and who's who he's ex or she has excluded from consideration. So it's completely read through a political lens as if the book is nothing but a tool of political and economic domination essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       And that's the assumption. And like, look, everything's contaminated by politics and power to some degree. Right? But that doesn't mean that there's nothing to art and literature except in service of, of like group domination. It's an appalling way of looking at the world. It would be an extraordinary bias to bring to Jane Eyre is very difficult to sort of make sense of it through that Lens. Of course you have economics and politics who would like, yeah, of course important themes are going to be present in great works of art. But, uh, I, I'm in chess, there's still great works of art. Yes. The thing, and it's like, well, even even with something as transient as comedy, let's say, I mean, you can't reduce comedy to the political or the economic and, and, and, and comics who become too ideological, let's say like musicians who become ideal to ideological. They're just not funny anymore. You have to be, I mean, you can have your viewpoint left to right. That's fine. And people do, but you have to be able to that viewpoint continually and you have to be able to criticize it, right? Because otherwise you're not a music. You just become a demagogue of sorts. Yes. I would agree that once there's a rubric to which you

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       come in slave, that becomes a dogmatic then, then there's no room for nuance. There's no room for hypocrisy. Humor, they're transcendent mirth, chaos. These forces need to be unleashed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       I think there's also things you can no longer laugh about because you're, you know, you're so committed to your axioms, you can't, you, you dare not transgress against them. And if that's deadly, if you're a comedian, because the rule for comedy would be, and this is something I like about, about Sarah Silverman for example, is she will say anything if she thinks it's funny. She's very daring in that manner. Like, I've heard her tell jokes that, you know, really would curl your hair, you know, but you can tell by watching or something will pop into her head and part of her golf chase, I don't know if I should say this and then she'll say it. And it's often like horribly funny and horribly funny. It's a good kind of funny, I mean it's, it's, it's daring and, and it's something I really admire about comedians too, is that they'll, they'll take that risk. And, and it's something also that I've found disturbing about with regards to the many things I find disturbing about university campuses is that so many comedians won't go perform on university campuses anymore because they can't be funny. People get offended and it is a false, so fen offended.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       I think you're right. I mean, I think it's like a kind of Simon says type of, uh, like him. Do you know that game? Do you have that game in your language? It's just like, are there certain things that we know we're not allowed to say? There's certain things that we know we're supposed to think. There's a kind of a, a kind of form you like dance, a courtly behavior. I've heard it referred to as that we are meant to pay homage to a particular type of set of protocols and manners and it's not necessarily anchored to a real morality is not anchored to a sort of a sense of spirit. So we sense of love or kindness is about like these are the rules that we abide by. Hm. I want to talk to you a bit about the 12 steps and the model for handling addiction that I've written about myself in my book recovery cause I want to see what you think of it a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       So like the 12 steps have anonymous fellowships, which I, if I were to belong to them, I wouldn't be able to say who it belonged to them without breaching their code of anonymity. But, uh, the, uh, what's positive about, uh, this approach to addiction is a, as we have discussed off Mike, uh, that it creates community like the other people that have got a similar endeavor. And in fact, it was young, the identified, uh, this, uh, this solution. He said that like people who have got chronic addiction addiction issues will struggle to change. And that's to have a spiritual realization of some kind and the support of a community. Yeah. Well I'm the spiritual realization component that's actually supported by

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       the relevant addiction literature. One of the classic cures for addiction is spiritual transformation. And the hardcore scientists have have laid that out as, as a reality in the addiction literature. Agree. Because these more secular language around that a spiritual transformation could just be a change of perspective or a renewal radical change of perspective from an, and it typically, in my experience, that's from a self centered view as self obsessive view about getting your own needs met. Uh, solid cystic narcissistic perspective of low life is this is just an adventure where I go around trying to key millay and accrue to, Oh wow, I'm here to be of service. That's of the transition in ride microscopically. But in addition to a community like having connections between one another, the 12 steps themselves, I think are an interesting model for transformation and shouldn't be overlooked. And in fact, what my book was about.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       Canton, could that method be transposed to anybody who's interested in change? So I wanted to talk to you about that, to get your perspective on them. The first step is acknowledging that you were powerless over your addiction and your life has become unmanageable. Just admitting this, I don't want to be in this situation. Okay, so two, there's two parts to that admission. A one is that you're in trouble. Yeah. And I guess there's three. You're in trouble and it's serious. Things could be better and you don't have the wherewithal at the moment to make them better. So the thing that's interesting about that is there's a kind of radical humiliation and humility that goes along with that. So you say, I have a problem and what I know at the moment isn't sufficient to solve it. Great. Because now you've opened yourself up to the possibility of learning something as you say, well, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       I don't know enough to fix this. It's like, okay, well you could learn. And one of the things that's so interesting about people is that if they decide they have a problem and they also noticed that they could learn, the probability that they will learn goes way up. That's very interesting. You've actually conflated the first three steps there in your analysis of the first one because the first one is admission that there's a problem. The second one is recognizing that things could improve, like came to believe that power greater nsls could restore us to sanity and the third one has made a decision to turn our life and our will over to the care of God as we understood God. So like, you know, yeah, we could talk about that from a secular goes back. Well, we could talk about that from a circular perspective and say, well there's a, there's a higher order moral principle that needs to be brought into the situation.

Speaker 2:          00:17:19       And you sort of described that right at the beginning of the question because you said, well, what? Partly what you do when you move from an addicted state, from a psychological perspective is moved from a viewpoint of the gratification of immediate desire. And, and maybe the accumulation of things as a marker of success to the notion that no, you actually have a higher purpose and that higher purpose might involve being of service that could be of service to yourself, which means you wouldn't be addicted anymore. Cause that's not a good way of being of service to yourself. But I've service to yourself and the broader community. However you might define that, that's a higher order purpose and it can integrate your motivations at at a level that doesn't leave you at the whim of impulse. That's the purpose of a higher order motivation. So okay, so we've got three yes.

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       That's the first phrase to get you to that position where you're willing to change, believe in the possibility of change and accept help in order to achieve that change. The fourth and fifth steps are about inventorying. Get like this is where the 12 step program becomes a fusion of spirituality and psycho analysis. Because the fourth step is a like a, a four column method where you write down a list of all your resentments in your life or childhood resentments, your resentments against the government. People you work with, you write it all down and then there's a diagnostic tool where you identify what it is in you that doesn't like that. And, and also interestingly in, uh, in 12 step, um, theology that's call it, it says that anything, anytime that you are personally disturbed there is you have to take responsibility for it to a degree.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       There is something in you that's being effective. It should at least ask yourself that question. Is it me or is it the world? Yes. Well, let's consider first the possibility that it might be, I wrote about that in the sixth rule, right? Put your herself how say yes, yes, am in fact, I've got, are the two row like my, like I did a truncated and somewhat more as, uh, linguistically explicit a, an explorative laden version of the 12 steps. And I've got your 12 rules for life here. That, and they don't necessarily correlate, but like, cause like in instead of your first one, stand up straight with your shoulders back. I that. So a great chapter I think I love about, you know, the lobster staff and this sort of the uh, the ancient, timeless, all most roots of hierarchies and the chemicals that are at play.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       What's happening when you're, what does that play when we talk about self esteem? Um, I like and the year the six one set your own house in perfect order. I suppose before you criticise the world steps four and five in the tea in a 12 step program, deal with that inventory. What's going on in your life, inventory, what your baggage is in your own personal think. It's very practical down. It's like, well let's say you want to fix up your house, which is actually quite a lot like fixing yourself up, which is a very common dream. Metaphoric attic. Well, the first thing you want to do is go look around and see what needs to be fixed. You know, and, and that's the interesting thing about that. This is a kin to what comedians too, is that as soon as you're willing to admit Comedians, look at a problem and then rise above it right away and make a joke about it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       But as soon as you're willing to admit that you have a problem, then you're immediately contacted the part of yourself that's at least strong enough to admit that you have a problem. And so, so the act of admitting the problem is actually the first step to solving it. You might say, well, and it's an optimistic step because you, you might say, oh my God, I can't admit to I that I have a problem because what if I can't solve it? Or, exactly. So then maybe you won't admit to it. If you do to it, you're a simile. Tanium admitting to the possibility that you could solve it and then it can actually become something that's optimistic. You can say, well, my life is horrible. It's like, okay, but I'm doing 50 things wrong. Well Great. I could fix those things and then maybe it wouldn't be so horrible.

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       It demonstrates the admission itself demonstrates progression and possibility for further progression. I think it relates, that's why humility is always stressed in, in great religious traditions. Humility is precisely that. It's like you have to look at why you're not so good. Yeah, and and you know that that has to break down your pride to some degree in your arrogance. It's like, well that's great because if you break down your pride in your arrogance, then your prime to learn and you can solve your problems. So there's nothing in that. It's a bit crushing to begin with because you might think, oh my God, they're pretty, a lot of things wrong with me, but at least then you're on the on the road to fixing them. My pesonal Janay recovery has been a good, like a kind of death. It like, you know, look at that. When I was 27 it was like the death of the drug addict self.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       That guy dies funny because I told Tammy when we were coming here today that when you were 27 you made the decision to live. I knew it was 27 because that's when people, I'm going to say like cue, but you know celebrities who, who are sort of on fire, they die all the time at 27 because they don't make that decision. They decided that they don't decide that they're going to take that final step into maturation. They want to hold on to that Peter Pan thing that that pause you bet you exactly that. They want to hold on to that and you, you can't hold onto that and live. Yes. And then there's a further death, I'm noticing now in my early forties so that like, ah, now like the midway point at the Nicoe and that sort of Dante Esquire, ah, I'm, and now I'm moving towards the grave and now I'm at like, there's a different kind of alertness and merging and back to this step four and 5 million in this process of inventorying.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       After you've made an imagery and you've, you've correctly, you've honestly and openly put down everything, incidents of child abuse, things that you've said to other people, things that your shame. Once you've been willing to inscribe your shame, then you tell another person, a person that you trust. In the original literature it says, you know, it could be a cleric or doctor or whatever. It typically in a, in 12 step structures, it's like a mentor figure, but that has the, that's the role of confession, which obviously a huge part of psycho analysis. The point in your book, I think this pertains to is when you took that the dragon and the dragon that you said there was that kid's book that you read where it talks about the dragon getting bigger and bigger. If it's not identified. I think four and five are somewhat like that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       Yeah. We'll end. Part of the point of that kid's book is that as soon as you turn around and look at something, it tends to shrink. And that's partly because imagine that you have a memory that you won't confront. Well, there's something in that memory that's terrifying, but, and that means it's sort of associated with everything else that's terrifying. And so it's horror. It's a horrible, but then when you turn around and look at it, you think, yeah, it's horrible, but it's, it's horrible in this precise and defined way. And that takes it away from all the other potential horrors of it. It starts to shrink it right away and also makes you into the thing that can turn around and look at the horror, which is a real, real positive transformation lacked on your part. So it's true that somehow in be in being prescriptive and being specific, the problem becomes manageable because otherwise it's limitless.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       It becomes a apocalyptic in the end is, well, what's the worst thing that's Kevin is I could be destroyed. And everyone I love could be destroyed and of itself could be destroyed. And until you say, well, actually, you know what this is is you feel inadequate because you weren't role models. Correct. There's all right, well I can maybe take care of that. It's still bad, but it's not everything. And then you, you phrased that exactly right is that without that attentive delimiting it becomes apocalyptic. That and that, that's a very, very old idea. So one of the things that happens in the Mesopotamian creation myth, the Enuma elish is that the guards are created there. There, there are the offspring of chaos. That's a good way of thinking about it. And they become very careless and they destroy their category system. They destroy their father essentially.

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       And chaos comes flooding back. And that's what happens to people who aren't looking at things and delimiting them properly. They become up apocalyptic and do the mint. So, but sometimes in a nithya there is the positive, um, fantech confronting of the God aeg Prometheus's. So sometimes we need to steal, steal the fire. Sometimes we need to challenge these orthodoxies, don't we? Yesterday? Absolutely. I mean part, part of the, well part of the death that you're describing is actually the confrontation with a form of tyrant. Like your previously addicted self was the tyrant over your emergent self. Yes. And so it's an internal tyrant and you said it was predicated on a false value system. That's a false set of God's essentially. And so you had to confront that that is a kind of death. I also think that some of the addiction or addictive tendencies, and I don't mean as severe as chemical dependency or forms of addiction addiction or a kind of self constructed formaldehyde to preserve you in the state of trauma, that trauma is acknowledged.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       No means to navigate trauma are present because of the isolation. Because you have no mentor, you have no, you have no doc Trin, you have no community. So addiction steps in, this is how our preserve, this is how I will not die. I will find this repeat notice. There is a habit, a repeated pattern to sustain you, a holding pattern so that you don't die because there is no way out. There's no guide, there's no path. You'll just in the forest and there isn't a way out. So I feel that addiction for a personal experience and that I, I hope and suspect more broadly is a means for sort of status for preservation. After trauma, the rupture occurs is not addressed and a means for survival and merges in the form of addiction. Addiction is not your nemesis. He is your friend at least while you're, you know, in, whilst you're in war, there's certainly a literature

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       on addiction that indicates that many people use addictive substances as a form of self medication and they tend to find the drug that best, best medicates them, let's say, and for different people. That's different drugs. Yes. Yeah. Now see, one of the other things that I'm proposing in my book is to use Roth grandiose terminology is that the, uh, that the template for a recovery from obvious forms of addiction could be applicable to less evident forms of addiction. I eat just patterns and habits and because we're so far, the things you've laid out would be, would be in keeping with that idea. Well, you admit to the problem. I really also, I think the idea of laying out your resentments is unbelievably useful because that's also a way of dealing with the malevolence within you that might interfere with your own recovery because you're angry at yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:27:39       If you're angry at your parents, if you're angry at the world, the probability that you're going to be in the mental state that's going to allow you to charge deposit of course for yourself is very, very low. How can you have a clear and authentic relationship with your wife if you've not correctly understood what you feel about your own mother? If you feel like that you are immeshed or trapped in some way, how am I supposed to have an or if I've not understood that if I've not gained a new perspective, if I've not transcended it by sharing it? Another, pursue that in, in, in the sleeping beauty story and the Disney story, when the prince is encapsulated in a castle in the dungeon at the end and before he goes and rescue sleeping beauty, he has to confront his terrible mother. She turns into the dragon of chaos itself.

Speaker 3:          00:28:17       He has to use honesty and truth to confront her. And until he does that, he can't free the maiden from her sleep. Yeah. So that's called the, that's called the freeing of the anima from the negative mother archetype and union psychology. It's precisely that and that, and that negative feminine will be overlaid on your partner unless you, unless you're able to clarify it and clarify your relationship with it. And that could be something like overprotection or it could, you know, in your past or it could be neglect for that matter or it could be the rejection at many, at the hands of many, many women before you encountered this woman and that then you are going to bring that bitterness forward as a kind of projection. If we are unwilling to undertake this kind of excavation, then we are doomed to continually have relationships that are cutaneous just to the superficial coordinates will govern our experience in pronation ships.

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       So that's the repetition compulsion from a Freudian perspective is that that isn't how Freud explained it. That's how it union would explain it. But, but the simple explanation of it is, well, if you bring the same set of precise, unexamined presuppositions to every situation, the same fate will play out. You might say, well, all those women are the same. It's like, well actually no, but the part of the part of them that you're able to make contact with acts the same every time. That's a very different thing. Brilliant. And this is where six and seven the next steps are chronologically occur, but

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       there's six. Having done this inventory, you recognize what patterns have been at play in your life, which particular in the lexicon of the recovery defects of character of governed you often pride wanting to control other people's perspective, self pity, self centeredness, intolerance in patients, greed, jealousy, envy, lust, sloth. That's where you identify the seven deadly sins and how they play out in your life essentially. Yes. And so, and you become in the six step six is about becoming willing to live differently. Saying I argue, actually willing to let go of last. Are you or do you like last when it comes to it? Do you like being impatient? Does it serve you in some way to be slothful? It's highly probable that it does. Yes. You know, it's, it's, it's easy. It's gratifying, it's powerful, it's pleasurable, especially in the short term. Like there's lots of, there are reasons that people are tempted by, by the seven deadly sins kind of glorious there.

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       Dot. Laurie and they have a wrong, that's exactly right. There's a dark romantic and he really see that in the deaths of celebrities around 27 is they, they fall in love with the allure of that kind of have that romantic death and it does the men, so the Anti Libido, the dark libido, the death force. So with the, once you have diagnosed, which particular defects of character of being most prominent in your path and become willing to let go of them, this like at step seven is making a concerted and real effort to live without them. And this is where it kind of becomes to sacrifice theory. That's what are you willing to sacrifice in order to move forward? You have to give up something that you love and you may have to give up the thing you love the best. That's the fundamental sacrificial Motif, sacrifices and an unattractive idea in our self, in, in our society that's based on consuming and indulgence.

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       And this is not something that I would lay, this is again, perhaps you were, you and I somewhat differ is that I would not, whilst this will not change without the individual's engagement, a kind of step one and acknowledgement that it needs to be changed. This is where I say there is a social responsibility, but for whatever reason our society has become a manifestation of these darker impulses. These are the prevalent foresees, at least in the kind of society, Ilumien, I don't know what it's like to live in China or Libya. I'm just saying like in London, like what your kitchen with immediate gratification, too much emphasis on because immediate gratification is a tool of consumerism. This would be my argument. Um, so like, but at this point in the program, it's where the, the spirituality becomes, I find personally undeniable that you have to, uh, you have to call to something else. You have to in a sense, be lay yourself open. The idea of prayer becomes quite important now. So there's a, there's a union idea there. So the union itself is the thing that guides the Eagle through transformations. So managing the ego, which is what you think you are. Or the thing about the ego is the ego can be wrong

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and the ego can die and be reborn. So what that indicates is that there's something underneath the ego. It can guide that process of transformation. And partly what you're calling on when you call on this higher power is at least from a psychological perspective, it's a decision to rely on that thing that can guide you through transformation. Yes. Because surely as we said in relation to another, we are likely relate into a set of coordinates that we impose on Info Commerce, the female, the true same would be true of the cells that we have created, an impression and egoic impression. We have constructed an artificial self, but beneath it there is our higher self or an alterior self that can often composed of, it's often composed of things that you refuse to or would we're willing to develop. And so when young talks about, for example, the incorporation of the shadow was that you've constructed a Nigo and there's things it can do and can't do, that it's allowed to do and it isn't allowed to do.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       And then there's a shadow domain that would consist of those things that you could do but haven't. And some of that's terrible, but some of it's what you need to break free w uh, infinite variety in the shadow or are there sort of templates there? Would you say that, you know, a common component of the show, she's last aggression aggression too because they're the most, the two that are mobilized. Yeah. They're the two that are most difficult to integrate into the ego because aggression destroys and of course lost. Subsumes the individual too, too, too well to sexual sexual desire is such a lusty zipper identified as a very powerful self. It can, it can subsume. So I suppose that's why a lot of theological doctrines focus on the control of last another. There is, of course, it's a disruptive force, you know, because for example, if you make a medium to longterm relationship with someone in knew, negotiate that, that provides you with a stable structure that can operate across your entire life.

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       It's good for you, it's good for them, it's good for your kids, it's good for society. But then if you're really attracted to someone momentarily, you can be driven to act on that. And every, all the rest of that can burn up. It's not good. And so it's no wonder that it's viewed as a, a force of tremendous disruption. Now it's also a force of tremendous life, right? Because you want to be attracted to people. You want to have that, that, that vital libido is part of, part of what's driving you forward. But hopefully it's on your side and not working against you. And so, you know, if you're successful and you've put yourself together and you're disciplined, you should still be maximally sexually attractive, but it should be under your control. You're not, uh, you're not the puppet of that force anymore. It's integrated into you and that's a much better way to manage it. How do you, uh, in your understanding, how is the shadow incorporated? What rituals, what ceremonies, what behaviors successfully incorporate a shadow, say in the, using the example of lust with what's a way back in for the sort of, uh, for, for lust, there's been disembodied or repressed? What's a safe way for it back? Is there one?

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       Well, I think part of it is to, is to admit to your desires within your own relationship. You know, cause you might say, well, I'm, I'm tired of my wife. It's like, well, yeah, maybe. Maybe you're tired of the games that you're intelligent enough to play with your wife, but she's as plural potential as you are. And so you have to admit to your desires, let's say, and maybe you have to make them consciously manifest within your own relationship. And then you know when people can do that, people do that by, by dressing up or by, by playing sexually. I would say my play exactly that play as a transformative element. And that's a, you know, and it might be that you're uncomfortable with the idea of, of your wife as sexual play thing because you think that a woman who's married should be proper and Prim and should only behave sexually in a certain way, in which case, well that becomes stale and dull and you're more likely to be tempted by something on the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       For me, that's a very obvious example of how habitualized thinking is prohibitive even without reaching the extremes of self destructive, addictive tendencies. If I have a habit of regarding my wife as as object day, even if that's not a objectification as we are typically taking, but you know, limiting beliefs about my wife, the, the tools that break down addictive, uh, the thought patterns could be used to create new terrains, new liberty, new play. Thank you. Um, so like, so once you've done up to step seven, which is essentially the steps in, and you're right, it's sort of sacrifice of the old self and handing over to the, some kind of sublime divine self, um, that that step eight is you make a list of people that you have harmed and become willing to make amends to them. So you look back at your path and go, God, I shouldn't have stolen that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       I shouldn't have done that. I treated that person badly. That was wrong. I lied. So its moral, it becomes quite a moral monster. Real repentance, right? And atonement atonement is at one meant. And if you're a caring transgressions that you regard as transgressions now in your life, then you don't want to carry those forward. You want to, you want to, you want to step forward in life without that moral burden because you will have contempt for yourself otherwise and you won't take care of yourself. It also, uh, in a sense we were talking about it, about allowing lust backend incorporate in last just then, uh, this is a more, a broader method for incorporating annexed aspects of the self. Like, you know, how can you fully love, how can I fully love myself if I know I treat it that person abominably well, if I go back and say that was wrong, I did you wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       I owe you an amends. You are, you invite that part of your life in, you amend your path through life as well as teaching yourself that that is not the way we proceed any more. That's their pay. And, and that's a real, that's, that's taking our, that's real action in the world. It's not a hypothetical at that point, right? It's kind of like telling people what you've written down about your, uh, about your faults. Yes. Yes. Because it makes it real. When you, when you're acting it out with someone else, it's not only a mental thing at that point. Furthermore indicates step by step eight is done separately. The step eight is right out the list. People. Step nine is now going through it. It makes the distinction, I think to create a space for you where you're not going, where you're not continually thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       I don't know if I can do in that. I'm not going to apologize. I was abused by them. Fuck that. They did as much wrong as I did, which is not the point, right? It's not the point. And also I think we might've done more wrong than you do. Yes, but you're still stuck with the fact that you did something wrong. That's wrong, that's not good. And if you refuse to surmount the obstacle over, like you know, some arbitrary measure of who is more wrong, then you continue to cast yourself in victim hood. You have no personal autonomy shoes to go for it. It doesn't matter if you're only 5% at fault and it also doesn't matter if the other person apologizes to you. They should. It would be better for them. It might make things worse. Layout, that's not the point and this perhaps is where what I think is significant that now your life has become not negotiation between you and other billy beings as they materially present themselves, but between yourself and this higher purpose that has been declared earlier, that you are now operating on the in a very calm, a spiritual plane.

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       You are no longer about. If I do that, I'll get that. It precisely doesn't matter if they have a person goes, I don't care if you apologize or not. Super religious language that would be expressed as the discovery of your father in heaven instead of your earthly father because your father in heaven would be the higher spiritual authority to which you all allegiance. And you can think about that either in religious terms or a nonreligious terms. Is that what you've done is you've in some sense as you've abstracted the, the idea of a higher authority and a higher purpose and you've decided to devote yourself to that. That's a religious app and that's precisely antithetical to postmodernism is saying that they're, no, no, no, no. There is an essence, there is a category, there is a way. There is. That's right. That's, that's, that's what is precisely antithetical.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       Yes. Because the postmodern claim is that there are multiple ways of looking at the world. Many ways that's true, but the antithesis of that is yes. Just because there's multiple ways of looking at the world doesn't mean there are multiple proper ways of looking at the ways. In fact, there's a very narrow range of proper ways of looking at the world. My, uh, my concern with atheism has always been, it's sort of easy affiliation with nihilism or why don't we just wondering, it's not fucking people. Then that sort of like, that's like, that's where my mind immediately goes, if there is not an order, why not just smash everything to smithereens? And you're saying ideologically that is what's happening ideologically with deconstructing God. We are de deconstructing morality without for sure do gender. We're deconstructing that was the danger that both both nature and dusty Husky pointed to clearly.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       It's like you dispense with the transcendent principle and you open up the landscape for impulsive nihilism. What are they responding to? Post enlightenment rationalism? Is that, what does the Husky in nature responding to why they run, responding essentially to the idea of the death of God, both of them and, and that explicitly. And he's that an enlightenment idea. Like where is that? Where he's deaf of God happened in the house. Should be at the hands of a, of a kind of arrogant and narrow rationalism and the materialism. Yeah. And the exposition of, or the, the exponentially that has led us to where we're going now, which is a kind of, okay, we're, we're sort of digging the earth from beneath our feet, putting ourselves into the abyss. That's right. That's, that's the, that's the hypothesis. Precisely. Yes. 10, 11. The last three steps. Step 10 is, uh, like a continue to make inventory.

Speaker 2:          00:42:08       So like let this process continue like on a day. For me in psycho analytic terms, I see a therapist obviously like, like it's when like when there's a moment I know any spike in my energy. If I go, oh, I felt something that was interesting. I felt jealous there or I felt I felt small in that moment. These are the moments I know and go, well, how was I participate in that? What belief of mine was being challenged? Is that a helpful belief? Belief being a thought that I like having an 11 right? That's a kind of consciousness is like, well, I'm going to fall apart. I'm going to make mistakes. I don't want to make mistakes. I'm going to keep an eye out for when I do make mistakes and I'm going to make them conscious and then I'm going to try and work on them.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Yes. Bringing them into into consciousness cause my fear, my number one thing on a personal level, possibly on a social level, I don't know quite how to extrapolate or conflate those two notions is unconsciousness. I've get very afraid when I'm dealing with unconscious individuals. When Pete, when I'm, people don't know why they're doing what they're doing. You may see this in sort of violent rage or even in less dramatic or theatrical behaviors. And I feel there's a great idea that lurks at the bottom of the Christian mythological tradition is that a little bit of consciousness destroyed the original paradise. We became conscious enough to be aware of our own mortality. But the cure for that is way more consciousness, not a return to unconsciousness. Yes, there's no going back. There's no going back. I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie movies is, you know, they don't know they're already dead.

Speaker 2:          00:43:36       Um, like so like that danger of the Zombie is the danger of the desire for unconsciousness as a, as a solution to life's problems. And I think that this is again, something we're being invited to participate in through consumerism that live your life continually on the frequency of unconscious energy, such as desire and fear that we're not being, we're not being invited to participate on their level of consciousness, conscious interaction, presence in the moment. While you could make that case if you made the case that consumerism promotes the gratification of immediate desires above all else. I think he does. That's my, that's what I'm pushing forward with this original sin like, so a little bit of consciousness is a dangerous thing. We've become aware of our vulnerability, our mortality, our nakedness, corporeal nature. But the solution to this is to, to become more conscious to, we have to. So, uh, how do you, how was that? Did you have the whole rest of the Bible? Yes. Grinding. Where does that get resolved now when they get kicked out of the garden?

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       Part of, part of what happens in, in the, in the redemptive story is if you think about Christ as a symbolic figure, say a symbolic of the process of transformation that we just described is one of the, one of the morals of the Christian passion is that you need to radically accept your limitations. And so part of this keeping your sins before your eyes, which you just described, here's all the ways that I fall short of the glory of God. Let's say, you know, I make this mistake, I make this mistake, I made this mistake. That's all consciousness. And it's painful, right? Because you think, well, you become more conscious. It's this glorious process of enlightenment. And overall it is. But the details are exactly this. The things you need to become consciousness, conscious of our precisely, those things that you least want to become conscious of.

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       And that this is the Motif that you've identified in the alchemical tradition, because the whole chemical, the chemical motto, so to speak, was that which you most need to be found, that which you most need to find will be found where you least want to look. Right? Yes. And everyone knows that's true. Like you tell someone that they go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, I know that's true. So, and that's also the greatest barrier to enlightenment, because if a night moon was all, you know, tulips and, and sunshine, then everyone would be enlightened. But it's not. It's this continual bringing before yourself, all your proclivity for, for transgression. And that's that and that obviously because how are you going to solve your problems if you're not aware of them? Hey, we don't want to, we all discipline today, Jordan. Well, it's not surprising, but the alternative is far worse. That's the thing and that is the display because I was very curious. I was very curious. Like I said, I talked about this with Tammy when you were coming here. I thought Russell decided to live when he was 27 I can't. I would like to know why. So why did you make the decision to, to not allow what was consuming you to kill you?

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       In a sense, he was taken out of my hands for the first time. I encountered positive of male or 40 figures, curiously like, or at least that we're able to address that in particular, I was sent to a treatment center. I had free months. I had time to think. I had time to let I, I passed from childhood directly into addictive behaviors. In fact, those addictive behaviors are already present in childhood in a less toxic form in a, my relationship. In retrospect, we've, chocolate was addictive. My relationship with pornography as an adolescent addictive, I was using it to, for medical medical purposes. So, so when substances became an option in adolescents, it was seamless. And that meant that my emotional and in my emotional growth was arrested at that point. The reason I was able to stop is because inadvertent, I was offered help. I got, I was given help our people that the management company that was working with your cf of drug addicts, you should go away.

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       Okay. So partly that meant that re they regarded

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       you as the sort of valuable commodity that was worth preserving. Yes. There was a degree of that, right? Well, no, but that's helpful. I mean, regardless, so even if it's purely an economic interest, there's, so there's something to that. Yeah. So and so then you went into treatment and you found some people that I went, it was run by an atheist, a chip Thomas, but the 12 step principles, you can't unpick it from the Oxford Group. First Century Christian group. You know, there's the, and the, and I'm, for me it's more appealing when you talk about it in Uni in terms of though I have no problem with the sublime and the divine live for that shit. But like, like I was always trying to get out of my head off my face. Those were the things I wanted a sublime experience and experience of what is beyond the material.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       That's what I want to know. So like it was, but once I was in that environment and like given drugs to help where I was addicted to opiates, so I recommend a drug called subutex Dan and sleeping pills because I couldn't sleep. And during that time, I suppose in a way I didn't fully address the issue of addiction because my, I was really promiscuous for about a decade that I, those, that behavior was transplant it kind of effortlessly. But I do remember a kind of moment of epiphany. Epiphany is revelation of previously concealed truth when it first occurred to me, you, I suppose you don't have to take drugs every day. I remember that thought entering and it being sort of like, oh yeah, I'd never thought about that cause that will, I'd found a solution. It worked in, worked as a way of managing pain, prevent in forever mental investigation or discovery of conclusions that would have been unhelpful and that wouldn't have been able to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       I think in a lot of cases, and I'm sure there's many, many variables, uh, that, uh, that actually chemical dependency as a successful technique for preventing suicide. That there is just, this is a holding pattern to stop me doing something more dramatic and band, unless people have access to an ideology, a structure and support that will help them through that. There's, it's very difficult to overcome. And I was fortunate in that I was granted that and then granted this system. And so, and as I've been working in it, I've come to the conclusion that it is possibly universal, not because I think it's derived from universal ideas. That's why I think young I made that, that identified, Oh, if, if some, like if there's a spiritual experience and then the support for community, that's how someone could be stopped from drinking continually alcoholic drinking. And then they took this process where the 12th original 12 step fellowships took the Oxford group had a program of a sort of redemption and restitution and, and like it seems initially in a, I think in a materialistic society counter intuitive to think that the solution to addiction is going to be super spiritual awakening.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       But that's what it is. And the, the final steps, I'll stay connected once you wrote, like you're continually inventorying the moment we think, oh, I felt something there. Yeah. That you want to be in the moment connected. Like, and I have to know is if I, if someone makes me feel inferior or if someone, if I'm sexually attracted to someone, those are the most obvious examples of something that will take me out of my connection and that the, the final step is, uh, made it, is, uh, help others and remain awake. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       Well that's the end of the hero's journey is once you go into the darkness and find something of value, the next thing to do is to distributed, distributed within the community to bring it back and distributed within the community. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       Now told and D is it like it would be difficult for me to accept that you've not been a sort of personally affected and are not personally angry rather than just, um, objectively because your personal trajectory I suppose in the public eye at least began with the situation in Canada with a sort of forced speech or however it's termed now. You know, so like that they, are you able to distinguish between your sort of sense of personal irritation because, well, I think for most people, and tell me what were, whether or not you think that he's right, that academia seems like, um, uh, an ancillary area. It doesn't seem mainstream to most people. Like, but to you it seems as though it's a very, very vital, but you are an academic. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       Well, okay, so there's, there's two things there. I mean people regard academia as ancillary, but it's not the reason. It's not as because the universities train the people who run things and so whatever's mainstream in the universities right now, even though it's separate from society, is going to be mainstream everywhere five years down the road. And so that's, that's a big brawl against the vanguard academia. There's no,

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       do you think what's happening now in terms of a media and politics? You could, uh, could say you could preemptively if diagnosed that from what's happening five, 10 years? No, I,

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       I think, I think, I think that in some sense I was preemptively diagnosing it because I've been watching the politically correct postmodern types for quite a long time. And one of the C, one of the things I noticed about five years ago, six years ago, there were two things that I noticed that I really didn't like. The first is that because I'm a personality psychologist, as a researcher, not as a clinician, but as a researcher, I, I know the literature on gender differences in personality because it's part of my field. And I could tell that I was starting to have some reluctance to deliver the lecture on gender differences. And now I didn't stop. But I, I felt, I felt that I was treading on thin ice by delivering those lectures. And I thought, oh, that's not good because I'm like a comedian. I'm pretty much willing to say anything that I think is true and, and you know, regardless of the consequences in some sense, because I'd rather take the consequences of what's true.

Speaker 3:          00:53:20       And I thought this isn't good because if someone like me who's, you know, rather, um, uncontrollably mouthy, let's say it's starting to have second thoughts about teaching, what's a very serious topic and, and, and something about which there's a very well developed science then how much are other people starting to censor? And at the same time, my students, many of whom were female, were telling me that they were really hesitant to talk about gender differences in any of the courses they were running. And I thought, oh, this is not good. This is seriously not good. And so, and it's certainly the case that, that my colleagues censor themselves increasingly on campus with regards to the topics they're willing to discuss. And it's subtle, you know, because imagine in a given lecture I could discuss any of 10 things and three of them are taboo. Well, I just won't discuss those, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       And that's that. That's a kind of invisible censorship. It's not like I'll get up and say, look, I could have talked to you about gender differences in personality, but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just pick another topic because there's lots of topics to choose from. And that means there's going to be a bunch of topics that are really important because actually the issue of sex differences in personality happens to be really important that people just won't talk about. And the other thing that's so annoying about this is that, especially with regards to sex differences in personality, well, let's say, let's say that you're firmly on the side of women just for the sake of argument. Well, you admit to or deny the existence of sex differences in personality. What's better for women? Well, you know, the radical left is basically say, oh well those, if you talk about sex differences, then you're part of the oppressive patriarchy and you're attributing to women a different kind of temperament in the attempt to continue the suppression.

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       But I could just as easily say, it's like, well, wait a second. Like if you want to, if you want to, uh, give the individual the greatest degree of freedom, you say, look, you, you're different from another person. You're different on the basis of a variety of your characteristics, sex being one of them, that's going to have some effect on what sort of choices you want to make in your life. It's like go ahead and make whatever choices you want as far as their direct expression of your being. And so if you deny the existence of these sex differences, which no one, no serious commentator in the psychological literature, in the personality domain, and those are the people to know about this thing, nobody debates whether or not sex differences in personality exist or that they have a biological component. No. See. And what's also interesting about that is that none of those people are conservatives.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       There are no conservative psychological researchers to speak of there in a tiny minority. So the people that have done the research indicating that there are differences between the sexes and personality, and that those differences have a biological, in part a biological component. Those are liberal and left leaning. People who've drawn those conclusions despite their, you know, despite what their ideological presuppositions might have suggested to them to begin with. So, well, so you know, it's, I don't know what to say about that except that it's, it's all appalling. I suppose the fear must be that difference will ultimately be used for leverage, for status that sure, that's a reasonable fear, you know, because because anything can be manipulated but, but claims of identity can have identity claims that, that people are identical in some way can also be used for the same reason. You know, if I insist that everyone is exactly the same on all dimensions, that there's just as much of a totalitarian threat lurking in there as there is the threat lurking that we'll use differences as an excuse.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       Yeah. And we're also not having a serious discussion about this. It's like, yeah, there are men are overrepresented at the top of the economic apex. That's true. It's a small minority of men by the way. It's certainly not men in general, but they're radically underrepresented at the board, overrepresented at the bottom. And believe me man, like nobody cares about men who are failures. They are like off the bloody radar. Yeah. So and, and there's no sympathy for men who are failures. So men stock up at the top and the bottom and, and, and we don't have a discussion about that and we don't have a discussion about the fact that women are radically underrepresented in dangerous jobs, although they are or in or in or in, in trades that require like brutal physical labor. Women are radically underrepresented orange, orange jobs outside women are radically underrepresented. So the complaint is always, well, if you look at the top 1%, it's there are more men than there should be. You know, by pure sex division. It's like, well, yeah, but if you look at the bottom, the reverse is true. So if we're going to have the discussion, which are, and I don't really necessarily think we should have that discussion, but if we're going to have the discussion, then we should look across the entire economic spectrum.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       I wonder how much of this debate is being governed by unconscious forces. I wonder how much of what we're experiencing is a manifestation of, uh, uh, on, uh, we're, we're cartography has not yet been a lot of it. What are you thinking about any particular part of it? Well, I feel like is that the reason that the ice, imagine that you are arguments that are based on research are so successful is because people are expressing feelings as opposed to cogent and researched arguments. It feels like corvair is a powerful, dominant patriarchy and no one can deny. I mean that there is power there such a thing as power. And there are people that benefit from structures being as they are of course, of course. The point of those structures being the way they are. One of the things I've observed is that whenever change is discussed, you know, and my tendency has always been to be sympathetic towards movements that are about change or empowerment of what might be termed disadvantaged groups.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       Um, the changes or the that when you're curious about the resistance of change or the different difficulties that you face when trying to bring about change, look at who would be negatively impacted, where that change to be bought about. And usually that means that there's some people for vote. You know, conservatism makes sense to a particular group of people. One of the things I felt when I'm reading a book was that, you know, like I, I, because I think you're coming from a perspective of psycho analysis and it rings very, the language rings true and the analysis rings true. The Wa where I feel one question that I was keen to bring to you because when you talked about skateboarders in the US, I think it's the last bit one chapter and that spirit of a, a young people. Yeah. Courage and a willingness to try dangerous things and to push forward.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       Um, I wonder how that sits with the idea of uh, an earlier passage in the book where you talk about the gratitude that we should feel for, you know, having time to read a book and the ability to read a book and sort of respect for the establishment and systems that have been set up from which we all benefit in it. Because when I, you know, I, I could find it difficult to dispute your opinion about sort of a journalists. What would have been in the lexicon of the day socially social justice warriors and that kind of some what? Rootless unresearched rage. Like I identify what you're saying. There are people that can't keep their bedrooms tidy. We have be careful before you let them organize an economic system. But like, but, but similarly like in where is change going to come from? Who are, who is going to challenge tyranny. Yeah. Is it kind of thing. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       Those are the sorts of of twin forces that we have to contend with across the political spectrum. So I could run through something quickly to put the things that you just, that you just brought up in, in, in perspective, let's say. Okay. So the first thing is, is that hierarchies, if you're going to value some things more than others, then hierarchies are inevitable and you have to value some things more than others or you don't have anything going to be a or strength for something. What core competence or sure. Whatever. Whenever it happens to be the ability to play the flute, right? It doesn't matter. Why on my list. Well, what, what do you know? Obviously if you value music then you're going to value some musicians more than others because some are better. So as, and so you have to value things in order to move forward in life.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       And you have to value things in order to have something valuable to produce. But if you play out the value and the social landscape, you're going to produce a hierarchy. And the problem with producing a hierarchy is that a small number of people are going to be successful than the majority. And a very large number of people aren't going to be successful at all at, at that particular thing. It's inevitable. So, okay, now, so, so you wanna say while we have to put up with that, because we need to pursue things of value. Okay, fine. So that's the right wing perspective is that the hierarchy's are justifiable and necessary. Now the left wing perspective is, yeah, but wait a minute. The problem with hierarchies is that people stock up at the bottom and that they tilt towards tyranny across time. And that's also true. And so you need that dialectic in society between the right wing that says, you know, we need the hierarchies and they're useful and you should be grateful for them and they structure you and give you form and provide value.

Speaker 3:          01:02:59       And the left that says, yeah, but they exclude people and people stack up at the bottom and that's dangerous to the hierarchy itself and it, it means that people might not have opportunity and you have to say yes to that. The problem comes, and this is the situation we're in right now where the radical leftists, and this is mostly a problem that really permeates the universities. The radical left is say, yeah, but all hierarchies are just tyrannical power. It's like, oh no, they're not. Hierarchies are based on competence in it functioning society and mostly our society functions. So you need it. You can't go that far. Now that doesn't mean that the hierarchy's don't tilt towards self interest and tyranny across time, but that's a bad thing. It's even a bad thing from the conservative perspective so well, so there's room for the left, there's room for the left because the poor will always be with us. That's the reason that there's room for the left and that the dispossessed need a voice, not least because there are talented people among the dispossessed and if they're stuck at zero, everyone suffers because we don't have access to their talents. It's bad use of resources. But on the right it's like, no, we need the damn value. Hark is we need to be grateful for our traditions and our structures because they, they stop us from degenerating into chaos.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Also across the society, numerous hierarchies emerge and at some point decisions are being made about which thing, you know, easy. It being a brilliant flutist or brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning land or controlling energy resources or dominate in financial systems, which are the hierarchies that are most important. And also the, uh, what, because like it's the way that resources are designated and challenging. Those hierarchies seems to become, well almost impossible. I'm, when I was leaving the hospital, the brilliant hospital, they've been taking care of my mother recently. Yeah. I sort of like, you know, the level of crisis and trauma and tragedy there. Excellent. They've got this sort of thing. Best doctors, that guy might in griffith that operated on her bowel. He's like a fantastic surgeon. He is in fact him that trump was quote in when he talks about European hospitals with blood spattered from knife crime.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       It was a sort of a mangling of a quote that, that this might in griffith a given and they're sort of like, I step outside like in, I'm driving along along white chapel road and there are um, electronic advertising boards and it, the uh, you know, that require energy. Yeah. So tell me to eat, you know, sort of a McDonald's or kit kats or whatever and there's so much poverty on that street. There always has been in that part of east London, terrible poverty. And I feel it was moments, there are moments when I helicopter out to the macro a perspective that no individual can long hold or wait. That can't be long born. But in that moment I think, why is this hospital struggling for resources when we can afford to run electronic adverts for Mcdonald's? Who gets to decide how collectively and individually do we determine where resources and where power both in terms of energy but also in terms of human power and up.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       How were these decisions made and as you say, among the dispossessed there is, they were great resources, great talent. One would imagine if the research were possible to the exact same degree is there is power and talent among the possessed because it's normally an accident of birth that decrees and reading about your early life in Canada in a blue collar community and the sort of the mental health issues and the anger and agitation that grows there. So much of that is about resources, the dispossession of the native people of that area, the mental health issues if your friend Chris like that. For me, we the are rising through these hierarchies. We that have experiences of both sides of that line. Well, we are now challenging this evolutionary force. We are now in a position to talk about these hierarchies, how they're ordered and how they're organized and whether there is room for negotiation. Well, it's up to us to do that. Well, there's a risk in conservatism is saying, well this is how the cards have fallen. And Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       of course there is. That is the risk and conservatives. So how do we confront that? While the risk is the, the, the, the, the hierarchies ossify and turn to stone and then there's no mobility. And the idea that that things can turn to stone and they become tyrannical is an extraordinarily old idea. For example, in, in the story of Exodus, the story of Moses. So the Egyptian, the Egyptians are portrayed in that story as tyrannical conservatives essentially, right? And they're masters of stone. And Moses is a master of water. And water is the thing that dissolves. And so that drama's been played out in these stories that are thousands of years old. And in the Egyptian story, the ancient Egyptian story of Ocirus and Horace, oh, cirrus is the old king who becomes too rigid. And what happens to him is that he's, he's dismembered by evil. That's the consequence.

Speaker 3:          01:08:07       And so even the Egyptians long ago knew that the danger of hierarchies is they become static and corrupt and tyrannical. And part of what we do in our ongoing political dialogue and it and, and when it's genuine dialogue is to say, well look, are these, do these systems have it, we need them, they're there not avoidable. Uh, do they, are they functioning properly? Are they loose enough so that people can move? Are they, are they serving the broader good or have they degenerated into something that's too tyrannical? Now, you know, you, you kind of pointed to both of those in the way you formulate that question because you said, look, well my mum was in the hospital and she needed care and so, and I found a surgeon who was an excellent surgeon. And so, so what you did there basically was take a bow to the, you bowed before the functional hierarchy of the hospital and said, look, the greatest surgeon actually rose to the top and thank God for that because otherwise my mother would be dead.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       It's like, yes, that's our competency hierarchy. And it could be contaminated by tyranny, in which case it would be the brother of some powerful person who ended up with the surgical position. Right. And then everyone dies. And that does happen in many, many cultures where nepotism or connections define your position on every oxys. But then you said, well, but I went out to the hospital and I was driving down the road and I saw what appeared to be a misallocation of resources. And what we have to do about that is have it, have a discussion about it constantly. It's like, are we allocating resources to the appropriate place? Now the, the other lurking problem there is to what degree do we decide about the allocation of resources by voluntary effort, by, by planning, and to what degree do we let the market take care of it. And that's also something that continually requires negotiation. Mom's kate might, well, I don't trust that. Well that's the, that's the question is able to talk about it. Like it's a neutral thing, but it's just a conglomeration of interests of the powerful, well, it's, it's, it's a bunch of things. I mean it's that it can be that, but it can also be the way that we collectively value things. Like, let me give you an example. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       Look at our collective values and I'll just quickly say this. Yeah, I heard this thing in Sweden. They, uh, conduct regulate and control access to alcohol at a state level, like off licenses or liquor stores. There's sort of socially run and like, and they're not allowed to be advertised in Sweden's, you know, Sweden, I guess he's one of those havens of what you might go, I don't know what your views are. Sweden by see a lot of stories about Sweden. The same, a bit like a, Hey, we swayed and comes across as this, I guess I sort of this sort of postmodern democracy or in some respects anyhow, uh, like I, I thought it was curious that they control alcohol in that manner and I am envisaged that sort of breweries and liquor distributors would say, Hey, that's not free market. You're controlling access to, you know, people's access to alcohol as if somehow the free market was neutral, but they ease no neutral. If the market is what has the power, people's desires will be overly stimulated. People if people like, if people have McDonald's advertise that they're more alcohol, advertise at them people, Mcdonald's

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       and alcohol, there has to be some more realizing force. There has to be something that's not economically led. There's not the manifestation of greed that's in the conversation. Someone in a secular society where there is no reasonable or trusted voice of God has to be able to say don't drink too much alcohol. Too Much Mcdonald's cause people will. Okay. So, so let's see. I think, I think the most effective solution to that problem is to have the economic system run, let's say by distributed individuals who are themselves aiming at a higher good. So I think the way that you, the most effective way of regulating the market so to speak, is to improve the moral character of the people who make up the market rather than directly regulating the market. And not that the market doesn't necessarily need some regulation because you might say, well how about we don't devote alcohol advertising to children under 10 most people would agree that that's a reasonable perspective.

Speaker 3:          01:12:15       And so that is limitation on market forces. And there are places that you can find that, um, that that limitation being accepted by almost anyone. But, but the part of what you're pointing to is that if the only thing that's governing the market is concerned for pure market success than the market can produce all sorts of excesses. But I think what you want, you want, what you want is to help orient people towards a transcendent good. That's, oh, that's over and above market interest. So you might say, well, what interests should you serve as you're trying to be successful as a comedian or in while you're trying to make a living as a comedian say you might want to make sure that you're conducting yourself appropriately in the marketplace. You're concerned about yourself, but also your future selves because you have to take, and that's partly why addiction is such a catastrophe, right?

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       Because it's great in the short term, but it's not so good in the medium to long run. So you have to take care of yourself and, and your, your iterations through the future. You have to take care of yourself in a way that you're taking care of your family. You have to take care of yourself and your family in a way that you're benefiting the community and that should be foremost in your mind. So then when you start to make economic decisions, even in your business, you're not saying, well I'm going to do whatever I can to make as much money as I can. You're going to say I'm going to do whatever I can to make as much money as I can while also making sure that I'm taking care of myself and my future self and my family and my community and being like Grat, grateful for all of that and serving it properly. And then I think the market can work more effectively but still might require some, some discussion around the edges because you know nothing is simple. So the re the reason that I'm concentrating on the individual and individual development is because I think that's the best way to do that regulation. I think that's important. I think it's non negotiable I think is necessary by also believe that if you have a society this predicate it on the some of the worst of human

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       behavior. I lost the desire fear. If last fear and desire are so high in the mix, if you're continually being prompted towards onanism and consuming, I think it's that individual improvement will be insufficient. I re I feel that your success is, but I don't know it was based on, but I feel that to a degree you've contacted people and oh yeah, I can improve my own life. I can have a bit of personal authority and autonomy and I think that's hugely positive. But if every time you step out of your house, every, if every time you interface with society or pick up your phone or look at a screen, the aspect of yourself as being nurtured, that's being invited to participate are the lower aspects of your nature because those are the most successful routes to a person's decision making impulses. And I think that it's difficult to exceed.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       I think it's difficult for these individual projects to x to succeed. I think that your, you know, certain people will, that that message will take hold, but others it won't. So on to some degree we, I feel like I ain't like a big fan of regulation. I understand your irritation about what's being like this sort of a post modern deconstruction list argument of that destroy God that's destroy all categories, man. Woman, none of it's real. I believe in essence the humours the day or tease the gods. I feel these things are present, but I feel that we are already being subject to a kind of invisible tyranny, but it's already happening and I don't think it's happening as a result of like some critical theory postmarks just like, I feel like that, that's not where power is. That feels like it's sort of, it doesn't feel like it's just fucking powerful.

Speaker 2:          01:15:52       Was Glaxo Klein or like, you know, it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or like, you know, these, that's what I'm interested in. Did his power, real power and how power is functioning and how power is the, uh, negatively impacting ordinary people? Well, I think it's perfectly reasonable to point out that there might be multiple ways that people experience tyrannical oppression now because every hierarchy is going to tilt towards tyrannical form in its own particular way. And so I've been concerned about what's happening in the university on the radical left and your concern, the concern that you just brought up is something like, um, overwhelming large scale corporate dominance. And I think that's also a reasonable set of concerns. You know, it might not be for the best, for example, that all of our communication is filtered through google. That might be a bit too much. Um, the question is, the question always is, is what we can do about it. And I think the answer, the answer is an answer to that actually. The answer is we can lead people's ability to communicate untrammeled and so that's why I'm an advocate of free speech. We can lead people's ability to communicate untrammeled so that we can have intelligent discussions about those problems as they emerge

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       and hopefully work towards solutions because we can't just generate a structure of rules that says, well here's the 10 rules that are going to deal without complex situation because things change too rapidly for that. And the reason that freedom of speech as far as I'm concerned is the paramount freedom, the paramount, right. Also the paramount moral obligation is because it's through the, it's through our ability to exchange, to, to, to um, to exchange honest opinions that we participate in the process that enables us to keep tyranny of the sort that you described and the sort that I described out bay. And so part of the reason that I've taken the tack I have politically is because, well my government had the gall to implement compelled speech legislation without noticing what it was that they were interfering with. Cause you might say, well well that's, that's pretty much the end of it. How do you keep tyranny at bay free? The Ex, the the proper exchange of ideas between free individuals keeps tyranny at bay. That's the best we've got. It doesn't work perfectly. It's also I think a gift that England and in in large part has given to the rest of the world to formalize and codify that to put it into a body of law to a wreck governmental structures that are really predicated on that idea. It's a remarkable achievement and it's something we should be profoundly grateful for.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       Thank you. I want to talk to you about the taking that accepting praise on the behalf of England there as an English person I accept that there are two dragons. Then there is the inner and the at least unless until we've reached some non-dualistic utopia where everything is one. There is the inner tracking of our own desires and fears, but I suppose like when we're talking about management of resources, is that a phrase that we could give the came up earlier? Like the where, where does the attention need to go and it's difficult. Like you know me, I suppose there's something about my background that has led me to identify as the Dragon. Oh it's consumerism is turning people into consumers because obviously as an addict that's what I am, a consumer and roll truck and Schumer. And it seems that you, with your background in academia, this, the, the, this a neo Marxist post because, but when I sort of like think about aspects of socialism, Eg, you know, people are working too hard.

Speaker 1:          01:19:26       You should only work four hours a day. They should be time for fishing in the afternoon, which I think is in Das kapital. Vicky talks about fishing in the afternoon and for me that seems like a very beautiful and fair and just idea. Also I don't see them like wow, I can imagine that they're irritating on a campus, particularly for somebody who's research such a lot. I don't see them as powerful. That's my, that's part of my intrigue I suppose. It's comparable to when I was talking to Sam Harris and other post do I have maya but whom I go, oh yeah, but I don't like, you know, like when I'm talking to Sam Harris about Islam, I'll go be a, but when like where's how

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       is Islam at gonna be like, like I feel like it, even if he's aware of Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia as an economic entity, they're not an Islamic entity in terms of race, go do some Islam. It's like let's go do some business know and like, and so I suppose here what my, my, well I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned mostly with the emphasis on, on the collective identity rather than the individual identity. Like the process that you just described, I would say, and this is the answer to the question that you posed at the beginning of our conversation is is there something universal about the process that you laid out? And I think there is, and I think it's at the core of individual development and I think it's the most powerful of forces. And so I think that the individual should be regarded as the proper locus of evaluation.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       And the problem I have with the postmodern neo marxists types apart from the fact that there were analysis tends to lead to a kind of nihilism is that because they're making the group the paramount level of analysis, this sort of thing gets ignored. And I, what I'm trying to do in my work, we have a program called the self authoring program that kind of steps people through these 12 steps that you just described. First thing that people do is write about their past all the emotional experiences. The second thing they do is take an inventory of their personality, faults and virtues so that they can rectify the faults and capitalized on the virtues. And the third thing they do is chart a course for the future that takes them into account and others. And so, and I see it as a reflection of this universal process that you just described and I think it's the most powerful form of transformation.

Speaker 3:          01:21:46       But more importantly, I also think it's the one that risks doing the least harm. Like it hasn't heard anybody that you've put yourself together. It's just good, right? It's good for you. It's good for the people that know you. There's nothing about it. And it's, it's the right level of humility because you took what you knew to be wrong in your experience. You took personal responsibility for it. You made changes for yourself. You didn't go around pointing the finger at what was wrong with the external world and trying to fix it. Now look, it could easily be that once you have your act together, or maybe even before, you should be doing some things to adjust political systems or sociological systems. But the problem with that is what makes you think you can trust yourself? You know? And it's like, well, I'm compassionate. It's like maybe, maybe you're also envious of the successful and the probability of that's pretty damn high, by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       And so you better know before you express that compassion, especially in the political domain, whether or not that is contaminated by things about yourself that you haven't contended with. Do you think an on declaration, uh, along those lines or specifically that in the political field would be refreshing? Look, I'll tell you one of the, this is a very funny thing. So the ancient, the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia. So this is some of the earliest political we have, by the way. Here's what they used to do to the emperor. Every new year's Day, they would take him outside the walls of the city. So he was responsible for everything within the walls. Outside was chaos and the unknown, they'd take them outside the city, they'd strip him of all his emperor garb. So he's no longer emperor. They'd make him kneel, they'd humiliate him. I think the, if I remember correctly, the priest would hit him with a glove and say, okay, in the last year, how name all the ways that you didn't embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the Mesopotamians.

Speaker 3:          01:23:38       And Marduk was the thing that took on the great dragon of chaos. And so it was the, it was the responsibility of the emperor to, is to kneel down and say, here's all the ways that I haven't been acting out my proper self and had brought the kingdom into disarray and then he would be forgiven. They would act out the reconstruction of the cosmos. That was the New Year's celebration. And then he'd go in and try to be a good king. I like, so, yeah. Yeah, no kidding. Absolutely. It's like the confession of the emperor is, here's the way I haven't been good

Speaker 1:          01:24:08       and at any comparable, uh, and the powerful held up to that kind of evaluation in, we don't have rituals for that. Well, I suppose we don't acknowledge the emergence of order from chaos. We don't, uh, a merge [inaudible] knowledge, divine principles. So the powerful and light, and I think this is possibly because of a assumed meritocracy, but I mean, people that are in positions of power, they're there for a reason. You don't need to start stripping him naked and take them outside of the city and saying, how often did you rank in that Oval Office? Every day get out. Yeah, well I think there might be something to that. And that's the danger of pride that goes along with ascension in a hierarchy. Well, because I'm here in this position, I must deserve it. It's like, yeah, but there should still be something that you're bowing down to.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       And that might be the abstract idea of sovereign authority itself. If you think about it only psychologically, that's a figure that essentially has a touch of divinity about it because it's the on a key right now harm. So that's the Queen, the anointed and appointed monitor. She represents, you know, by I suppose in a post secular nation, she becomes the emblem of Britain rondon the emblem of God on, well, I think, I think it actually functions to some degree in the same line. Well, I do think so because the queen your queen in particular our queen as well because maybe an alien.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       No, I mean I think Alyssa has been, uh, uh, uh, an embodiment of moral virtue. I mean, she's done a remarkable job over the last, what is it, 75 years now. She's held herself to an incredibly high moral standard. And I think she does sit in the background as emblematic of what

Speaker 1:          01:25:40       sovereign authority might look like. Of course you postmodernist. And this is an area where, cause I, you know, I'm English and I can't get away from the love of the Queen, but I would also say that she is an emblem of authority and of power and of wealth and land ownership. And that there is, that there is an order that ought be respected and can't be challenged every so often this country sort of toys with the idea of they're always

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       grateful when there's a wedding, right? Maybe he's this week so that no one has to think, is this right? What are we paying for this bizarre spectacle. But it, but it is useful to think about it in a symbolic sense. I mean, one of the things that constantly threatens the United States, I think there should be four branches of government, legislative, judicial, executive, and symbolic. Because the problem in the United States is the president keeps tilting towards king, you know, the Americans like the idea of the first family and the first lady. And it's like, yeah, no, and, and, and, and kind of tilts towards a dynasty. And you've seen that happen with the bushes and the Clintons and it's not, it's, it's not a good thing. And it might be nice to have someone take the symbolic load off the president and just act that out. And your queen does that very nicely because all of the pomp and circumstance of the state and all the drama and ritual of the sovereign can be played out in that sort of dramatic space.

Speaker 3:          01:26:59       And your legislature and executive branches can go off and do the administration. It's interesting that the, uh, the, the, the dentist's ds exert themselves in a sense. It's a demonstration of your argument that there are certain hierarchal systems that find their way into fruition regardless of regulation. But then I suppose there's rational reasons they would have the resources, the experiences that can, the connections. Sure. It's easier for them. But that's also the d that's a danger to a republic is the fact that, and it's part of the potential corruption of the state, is that while it's easier for the children of those who have authority to have power, and you don't want people attaining the pinnacle of achievement because of power, he want them attending the pinnacle of achievement because of competence. Yeah. Yeah. And, and those things always struggle. They all, and, and it, it, it takes a society that's very awake to stop the hierarchies from degenerating into hierarchies of power because the generation is the tendency.

Speaker 3:          01:27:53       Sure. While it's easy, it's easy. Wba that fearsome and terrifying. Uh, you know, faulconer pallium well, and people have recognized that it's the proclivity of hierarchies to, towards tyranny for, for really, for thousands of years. And I've seen that as a fundamental danger to proper adaptation. We need hierarchies. Yes. But they degenerate into tyranny and they unfairly, oh, press. It's like, yes, we have to be on guard against that. But that doesn't mean that we call all hierarchies tyrannies cause that's not helpful. Or we call all productive activity service in the, in the service to the oppressive patriarchy because that's seriously not how helpful and we don't dispense with hierarchies because then people don't have anything to do. So yes. So I see, I get the beam out your iheart like so say if the individual is tuned, if the individual is at channel, I'm going to to, I like the prayer of Saint Francis.

Speaker 3:          01:28:52       I like it as a model. They invites us to find the reverse of h a defective characteristic that we all sin that we might be living out to become a channel of some inherent goodness. The thing that's one of the things that's interesting rolled out or two things actually. The first is the word sin means to miss the target. It's an archery term. So that's quite, that's a very interesting way of thinking about it because it means that there is a target, there is a target. That's the thing. But the next thing is, and this, this comes right out of that, is it's very useful to become aware of your faults because as soon as you pause it a fault, you pause it the opposite by merely saying, well, that's a fault. You're saying implicitly, while there's something that's the opposite of that, so out of your recognition of faults, immediately some clarity of virtue develops because you might say, well, this is a fault and I really know it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       It's like, great, you've got some bedrock there. Whatever the opposite of that fault is, you might not know what that is, but whatever the opposite of that fault is, is a virtue. And then you might say, well, I have 20 faults. It's like great. The opposite of the personality that has all those 20 faults is the virtuous you, whatever that might happen to be. Well, great. Then you've then you've conjured out of the devil, um, ah, a redeemer. It's something like that. I like that. And the UN doubtedly both in terms of cosmology and fleeting morality, there is chaos, there is vastness, but there are also patterns. There are patterns that emerge and whether you call that pattern male or love or beauty, there are various patterns and I feel that there is, there is something to get in alignment with. There is a choon, there is harmony, there is melody, there is grace.

Speaker 3:          01:30:42       We're not totally rested. All you're using their musical musical, uh, um, what would you call analogies are meaningful representations. That's what music expresses is to have all of that in harmony because people love music because of that, you know, in those patterns because music, you think about music, it is the harmonious interaction of patterns and you just described all those positive, uh, what would you call them? Spirits. That's a good way of thinking about it as patterns, while they are patterns. And then you might think that there's a pattern that's composed of all of those patterns. Well that's what you're after. You're after the pattern that's composed of all those patterns. Yes, absolutely. And you want to put yourself in harmony with that and that is a real thing. That's a real thing. You can feel that. So it's what keeps you alive essentially when you're trying to become conscious. Yes, yes. There is something important happening. I feel like what we were saying before about the acknowledgement of difference need an infor inferiority. That is something that definitely not while we should be actually, well, and this is part of what the radical leftists keeps saying is, well, we should celebrate diversity. It's like, yes, but what that means first is the admission that people actually differ. You know, always you don't have diversity. It's like, I'm glad there are conservatives. I'm glad there are leftists.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       The conservatives run things, the leftists invent them. It's like good and they're really different. Those people like you know, if you, if you have a group that's all conservatives and they're going down the right path, they're going to go down that path really fast, but if they're going down the wrong path, they're not going to be able to think laterally and figure out how to get out of it. If you have a group of of left leaning creative types, it's like they're going to come up with a hundred ideas, but the probability that they'll organize in a stable hierarchy and implement those effectively is zero. It's they're going to have to call over the conservatives. It's like, look guys, we finally got a good idea. You can have one idea cause you're conservatives run with it and then they can all run with it. And so it's really good that we have people who are like that on both sides of the distribution because otherwise the, the creative types would sit around and come up with new ideas until they starve to death in squalor.

Speaker 2:          01:32:52       And while exactly. And the Conservatives would just awesome fi and, and you know, run down a road that got narrower, narrow, narrow, and they'd all end up stuck between two cliffs and that'd be the end of it for both of them. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. We require synthesis. This is how does the interplay of opposites. Actual opposites. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Yin Yang that yes, there needs to be necessary collusion between distinction, but for that to happen, there needs to be acknowledgement and recognition of difference in a trying to achieve a quality with the Annihilation of category is not successful. Yes. That's that. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. That is not a successful route. Thank you. Duck tapped. Professor Jordan Peterson. We have good chats that way. That was great. Yeah, that was really good. Absolutely. Thanks for inviting me back. Thank you. Thank you for the time. Thank you. Thank you, Tami. Thank you.
