Speaker 1:          00:00          John peretti is an investigative journalist and broadcaster who's award winning television series include the men who might have spent the super rich and us and trillium pound island. He's written articles for the Guardian, wired and the Huffington post and his book done the secret deals that are changing our world, tells the story of the billion dollar handshakes that never make the news by revolutionizing everything we do. What? Welcome to our show. Thank you. Bless. Bless you for inviting me. We're really thrilled that you're here. I'm just give you a quick understanding of like what my motivation is at university, doing a course religion in global politics, Sal, as universities, really, really enjoying it. Getting an academic understanding of things that are intuitively understood for a little while now. Like your field of expertise is often submerged financial narrative that's actually governing and dominate in our world from an ecological perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Uh, a media can, can you follow the money? That's all you need to do that old cliche, but it's. But it happens to be a cliche for a reason, which is if you follow the money and you understand where the money's coming from, who's making the money, what the economics underlying everything we do from the coffee we buy to the job we go to. It's why we decided to buy that phone over over another phone. All of these things have economics of their heart. And so if you don't understand economics, you don't understand how the world works. What then should we understand about the world is we're experiencing it now. What are the, who are the dominant economic players that are determining what happens in the lives of ordinary people? Well, I think we are. I mean, trump has thrown a kind of spanner in the works and he's kind of, you know, I suppose what that represents as we know, is it represents of kind of dislocation of the old, the old status quo.

Speaker 1:          02:01          But that was because that wasn't working. And essentially what we've had over the last 40 years, and he's a kind of, I suppose a symptom or public a creation is, is um, what we call corporate capture, which was, I suppose that's the creeping end of government elected government and the rise of global corporations. And we kind of know about that. But I think what's really interesting about that for me is that corporations haven't done this. I'm out of some kind of evil machiavellian plot is just, it's just been a kind of failure of government to be able to, to run the countries that they supposedly run. You have. You have a world that I see is kind of the, the operates on two different levels. You have horizontally and corporations who operate across the globe. So they don't have any, they don't have any need to worry about territorial boundaries.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Governments operate vertically. They operate within the narrow constraints of the geographical state of which they operate. The two just don't meet. And I think as the world's become increasingly globalized, corporations have just got the whip hand and essentially government has become a kind of civil service for corporations. So the nation state, which is a relatively modern idea, is already been made in empower terms redundant because of the global power of transnational corporations and the sort of resurgence of an f, no identity politics. He's just sort of a response to that. So who, who are the corporation, I think that that's not, you know, I think that's what's interesting about that is that that's just the kind of logic of the way economics has gone, you know, I mean if you look at, if you look at Putin, he's really, he's not really the leader of Russia, what?

Speaker 1:          03:50          He's the CEO of Russia Plc. Trump is the ceo of a corporation called the United States, you know, and so I think it's interesting that we have business people in autocrats who are increasingly coming to prominence because there's a kind of almost implicit realization that that's the way the state has to be run. So iT's not as sort of right kind of thing. It's just that that's the nature of the way the world is going to mimic corporate models because the corporate model is now the dominant model. They stay idea sort of redundant, that make sense now and we know that, but we Can't admit that bEcause Otherwise democracy becomes a explicitly a fast. Absolutely. And you had that under the, under the cameron and under blair, you had the first sort of intimations of this where they started talking about the John Lewis model or you know, they'd start to say, oh, what if britain was run like John Lewis, you know, and then that sort of got the adverts.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Exactly. And now it's become the google model. So it's like, how come you know, how can I. And I went to this conference where, which was basically run by, it was organized by big corporate, big corporations and they asked me to go and speak to them and I said, well said, have you not seen my documentaries? You know why you're asking me to come into something. Well, we were interested in what you had to say and the way they were talking, they were talking aboUt corporate tax specifically about corporation tax and the avoidance, which is an issue in the air remains an issue in the air. They were sort of saying, you know, tax is such a redundant idea. It'S such an inefficient way of collecting money from us. We don't want to pay it. Governments don't know how to collect it. Why don't we run the nhs, you know, why don't we just do it directly?

Speaker 1:          05:30          and the sort of what was staggerIng was the kind of the breadth of their ambition. They didn't see any limits on what they should be doing. Well, we had professor David Harvey, a marxist professor in here, and he says that sort of stitched into the ideology of capitalism, which obviously I need to tell you, but to reiterate for our listeners is the idea of infinite limitless growth, like marxist theory, origin points out the floor, that we've got limited resources. So inevitably capitalism will have the mast itself. We're going to need a critical theory that continually exposes the fallacy of a model that as infinite growth. But what happened was an amazing moment. I mean, when you look at disposal, you know, disposable consumerism and I mean, you mean if you look at the way that the planet is going in terms of limited resources and what's ultimately going to consumers and you just make things that we throw away, so stuff that we bought, you know, things that we buy cheaply.

Speaker 1:          06:20          So the rise of, you know, the whole rise of high street riser, prime art, tk maxx, you know, little, all these, all these, these brands that basically produce goods that we could buy cheaply. When you look at that moment, 2000, around about 2000 and chemo has the very moment where global economies are beginning to stagnate. Wages are beginning to freeze. What we'd had was 40 years of quote unquote growth where prices rose, but so did wages in tandem with it at that moment. suddenly what happens, wages freeze. people's living standards can no longer increase. So what do we do? We make products that cost next to nothing. So people have the appearance of improving living standards, but products just getting cheaper and cheaper. And of course the price is paid by the planet. And so this is like, these are kind of the economics, underlying consumerism underlying where we are right now, who are the most powerful global corporations, well, when we talk to be, or it used to be the oil companies and the mining companies and uh, and the retail and so, and food unilever. So unilever, monsanto, nestl√©, coca cola, those companies run through. Those were the big ones.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Yeah. And what's extraordinary, um, uh, oxfam did an amazing graphic where basically what they've done is taken the 600 or so biggest companies on the planet and then they've drawn their connections to the bigger company that owns them. Right? So it's like, is this extraordinary family tree which ends up with literally five companies running everything and you think that's, you know, that's like, you know, if you wanted to believe in conspiracy theories, well, you know, just look at the graphics. So, you know, it's not, you don't have to believe you conspiracy theories to understand that very few companies are in charge of everything. But now in the last, you know, 15 years, what we've seen is the rise of the tech companies. Obviously, you know google, apple, microsoft, amazon, these are the companies that now people consider to be the most powerful companies on the and are the most powerful because of what they own for the future. They'll own data, they own data, they own everything. Everything there is to know about all of us, so prospectively the most powerful it is saying that the way that we evaluate power is changing. It's not necessarily now about capital. It's about potential power because of data. Data is the new oil. Data is the new oil because the set. Why? Well, because it's the most precious commodity on the planet because if you own data that means you go to market specifically to people you can control them and

Speaker 2:          08:56          you control their consumer.

Speaker 1:          08:57          Got russell brand's house and russell brand's houses. Heating is controlled by a phone which collects all the data and then collects all the data and what you buy collects all the data and where you've been for the last 48 hours. They know absolutely everything or will know absolutely everything there is to know about you, what you buy, what you do, what you liked, what you disliked, that that is power.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Because what I heard is that sort of maybe the word I heard that the uber furcation, that people will know that the way you, if once they know your habits and your patterns, then like that there could be a sliding scale of, oh, you need a plumber, do you will it's christmas eve. That's a thousand pounds. You could afford to pay it. That you can have a kind of a flexible capitalism that's responding to the consumer and extracting as much as possible. What I suppose is, so one of the things that you seem to suggest early jack, is that without some oppositional force, the limitless growth of corporatism will devour everything and we're already at a point where it's devouring the planet itself and the traditionally we would imagine the opposing force to be provided by the state, but the state has now become essentially the administrator for, for corporate is so that that opposition won't be variety.

Speaker 1:          10:13          What you've seen with, you know, and it's not the first person to say this, but you know, when you see brexit and trump, you see in a kind of sorts of inarticulated response to the end of the state, you see people wanting to take power back because they can sense an end, but they don't, you know. Do you see what I mean? There's a, there's a sense in which the state has lost its potency. Yes. Before we can articulate it, we know it. We know it's felt and people understand it and so, but I think. I think what someone says, w one entrepreneur said rather chillingly and brilliantly to me, he said, what we do is we invent a problem and then provide the solution. And so that's really what a lot of these products are about. When you talk about data and you talk about the plumber and so on, what you really want to do is you want to start giving people options that they never knew they had what like. So for instance, you know, if you watched this series, you're going to like this series. If you like that series, you would want to go on this holiday. If you want to go on that holiday, you would like to buy this car. If you want to buy this car, you might like to go dating these 27 different women. You know there's an endless endless tree that can be opened up in terms of what your consumer decisions will be off the back of one consumer.

Speaker 2:          11:24          It's and it's like, but you're trapped on a plateau of consumerism continually. You don't have another role in your life. Your role is to consume shopping is everything because you know when George Bush was asked after nine slash 11, what could the public do after nine, 11 twin towers? He said, go shopping. That's the solution. Helping

Speaker 1:          11:46          wasn't a frivolous thing. Grows shopping is actually what elon musk solution is to the road, to the automation. He says that essentially the only thing we can do productive to the economy is spend money. Consumerism is what it's all based upon. Debt is absolutely at the heart of it, so the. So the increasing debt that we have goes hand in hand with the need for us to continue buying stuff. And so what you'll come to elon musk has said will be paid a universal wage for doing, for basically going shopping once robots do everything, robots will be taxed, we'll get the money and then we'll go down to prime arc. And that's, that is the future for humanity.

Speaker 3:          12:23          That george w dot bush moment, it's curious coming as it did off the back of a seismic event that, that represented in so many ways, perhaps some unseen, a cultural clash that, uh, that he's, uh, a response to. It was go shopping it, it is the modern equivalent of saying, pray, go and pray because that, that is our ideology. That is when we talk about extremism in the more obvious forms of religious extremism, we seem unaware that the dominant extremist ideologies, one where we are consumers and like you said, entering potentially into a time where you are nothing but a consumer.

Speaker 1:          13:07          Absolutely. And I think this I think was interesting is when we moved to online shopping, what's that gonna do to the cathedrals of consumerism, you know, the shopping centers, these places where we go to worship the god of shopping because in a sense that that replacement of god with shopping has been with us for half a century. It's kind of what we know and we're at a. We're shopping is a profound, is a profound thing. It's not only profound in terms of how the economy operates, it's also profound in terms of what it does neurologically to us. You know, we talk glibly about shopping addiction, retail therapy and so on, but those feelings, that endorphin rush, you know, that release of happiness that has to be replicated, that addiction and you know about this stuff, you know, that addiction to that feeling has to be replicated faster and faster and more often and more often the shopping is at the heart of who we are, how we define ourselves in relation to our neighbors and our friends. It's absolutely everything. It's the heart of capitalism. Yes, yes. It's the way that we,

Speaker 3:          14:06          the way we see ourselves, if we're not consuming, we're not existing. Now, whilst I see the the economic analysis that you're conducting is the. It seems to me is the truest way of understanding this problem. It's valid, it's demonstrable, it's scientific. You can go look, this is where power is. Look at how it's responding to look at the decisions that are being made. Look at this reality. Look at these deals. That's why you're living in this reality. That's the way that's a way of tracing it to. In terms of change, it seems that we are very difficult to implement change on an economic level because there isn't by definition or all of the power is held by people that want to maintain these systems.

Speaker 1:          14:47          I think if you understand why they got to the place it's in, which was money, you understand how money is perhaps the only way that will get us out. You know, I spoke to peter teal who created paypal rallies. There's silicon valley billionaire. He said, the whole problem with the way we framed global warming has been in terms of a moral argument. We've put we, we, we've said to the public, this is bad, people don't care. Daniel condom and the behavioral economists said, there's an extraordinary moment. Basically when the, when a problem is too far away, we don't deal with it. When it's too close, it's too late. He said there's a window of opportunity where something can be done and that's literally where we are with earth right now. But you see the pizza go back to the pizza. What pizza tail was saying? He said, if there's money to be made from saving earth that believe you me will have clouds with avn logos on them. We'll have cows with, you know, a monsanto logos on them. You know, if, if that's what's required to sort the earth out is to find a way of making money from the salvation of the earth. And that's the way forward.

Speaker 3:          15:50          Yes. But that's slightly bleak view. But another quote that recurs in this program is, it's easier to envisage the end of the world than the identity is invisible to the end of capitalism. But this economically will come before the other. It seemingly, um, uh, but you know, I can't see how it can be amended through economic means unless you sort of started. We uSe for a moment that touched on the, there are sort of biochemical imperatives to purchase and spending. We're doing it because we get a feeling inside our anatomy. It within our consciousness for me that the opposition can only change if people start looking at reality in a very different way. That's what I think is being suggested. The way that we intuitively understand that nation state is ending or has already defunct except for in a superficial way. Uh, I think that we, we also know that huge change is required outside of the systems that we currently live with him. I'm

Speaker 1:          16:52          kind of a believer in, in the economics myself. I tend to think, you know, I interviewed thomas pickety and a kind of an interesting guy, the french economist in a wrote capital and I said to him, what, you know, this moment, you know, what's to be done. And he saId, well, you know, we corporations, we could, you know, we could create a global tax system. We could create. We could retool the imf and turn them into a force with teeth that could deal with corporate, and I said that you're basically like asking for birds to go in. That's not gonna happen. And he said, yeah, the other thing is will we could have a revolution? And I said, well, in what way are we going to have a revolution? Because the revolution is that you look at traditionally, you look at the russian revolution, you can look at the failed 68 attempted to revolution.

Speaker 1:          17:32          What were they? They were the. They were on the on an economic rise where you had a prosperous middle class that was demanding more what we have now, and he said, yeah, but what you have now is a potentially combustible force of a middle class who are disenfranchised from what they believe they're entitled to from the last 40 years, plus an huge underclass of people who literally cannot exist, and that together is a recipe for revolution. That's what pickets. He was saying, and I think you know what you do have. What we do have in history is we have the inevitability of change. That's one thing for sure, so whatever we feel is now the catastrophe of the moment we're in that is going to change what, which way it's going to go, who knows? But things are becoming more dramatic. The cycles are becoming more dramatic and as Adam Curtis said in this film hypernormalization, we've normalized the catastrophe, so a point where we accept that as part of the cycle and so that's an interesting thing.

Speaker 3:          18:32          Well, we're talking more about revolution towards the end of our conversation, but I emphasize and highlight now the nature of this catastrophe. Can you explain to us what's happening within agriculture that demonstrates the severity of the problem

Speaker 1:          18:46          you shouldn't have asked me to. I will tell you. It's pretty extraordinary. It's pretty extraordinary because the other. You shouldn't have asked me that because I just don't want to tell people what's what's going on. I'm so bad. I mean basically the who did a report two years ago now, the backdrop, a lot of science that was being done across the globe, they'd put sort of put it in one place and they basically analyzed a lake in the of region of France, which had been undisturbed for a thousand years. Really? They looked at the sediment in that lake and there was any kind of really interesting experiment. Bear with me on this. what they found was the sediment had been pretty much undisturbed up until the industrial revolution. Then obviously things had started to change. The nature of the sediment have changed that. Then what happened in the last 40 years was that basically the nutrients had completely depleted, so as a result of intensive farming of intensive farming, not just to create wheat, but also to create basically animals and dairy. For us to eat and consume. We had leached the soil of all it's nutrients resulting in the fact that we have just 60. They estimated 60 harvests left in the planet.

Speaker 3:          20:06          Wow. So that's sort of a sort of a food armageddon

Speaker 1:          20:10          is approaching. Yeah, and it's kind of learn. And again, you know, when you talk to people in silicon valley, they say, you know, we're, we're across this stuff because it's an opportunity and you say, well in what way is an opportunity, synthetic soil, vertical farming off I'm off world farming. They're talking about the martian for real. Could we turn the moon into an agricultural place? Could we move all the heavy industry into space? That's what Jeff Bezos is plan is, you know, this is the stuff that they're dealing with now. You know, 10 years ago it was all tech. It was all silicon valley was all about going into going into the micro, the details of how a phone works, what can a phone deliver as a computer now it's like looking out into space. All a super macro and that's where the r and d is.

Speaker 2:          20:56          When I think about my own life, it's kind of evident that there is a problem just from the way that I can share my own is aware of these kinds of arguments. But like when I figured my domestic waste, I think, oh god, passion weekend thrown away. This doesn't seem right. That there is a detachment, there is a lack of consciousness and I can see how sort of this is a personal, it's a personal problem, one level and I think we feel hugely disempowered. You think, oh, I'll put that in the recycling. I'll help. maybe I shouldn't do some more composting, but you will in the face of these forces, it feels irrelevant. The other thing that I'm learning, it must've disjunct in terms of power and what a theme that is between the personal and the power. The other thing I would get from what you just said, jack, is that when they talk about, you know, oh, we'll just, you know, colonize the moon or whatever it is this week.

Speaker 2:          21:46          It makes me realize how detached the powerful or from the lives of ordinary people, because you mentioned a moment ago that the combustible revolutionary engine will be a a middle class, which like a lot of people feeling like that. The privilege that they're entitled to, the resources and comfort they're entitled to is being eroded and then a giant on the class. Now that on the class is as long ago, been nominated as disposable wherever it was in colonization, slavery onwards, perhaps even earlier than that, that there's a huge percentage of the population that we simply, we do not care. You are, you are already machines. And when we get better machines to replace you, you know, if we can find a nice way of framing genocide.

Speaker 1:          22:31          No, that's, you know, the, there's a brilliant, um, Paul Mason does a brilliant thing called the car wash paradox and it's basically what was, what was the car wash? The car wash in the 19 fifties was this amazing shining new piece of technology right here. It was, it was going to automate fluffy buds would come out and clean your car and it will all look amazing. What's happened in the last five years, car wash, the last 10 years, car washes, I started closing down right there in prime locations in the centers of cities which can then be turned into luxury flats. All these automated machines have disappeared. And what has replaced them? We're dead spaces on the outskirts of town where you have immigrant labor or cheap labor doing the job that machines would they. So you know, one option, you know, the machines had been made redundant by human beings.

Speaker 1:          23:21          The difference being that human beings have absolutely no rights. They can be sat there and then and the and the whole thing can be taken down in 24 hours. Right? So that is one future that we might have. The machines might not replace every one. What might have is we might have this incredible moment and what we see on the news nightly as we say, full employment employment's never been higher and yet they say also wages are stagnating. How can this, how these two things correlate the same time? Well would mean increase in part time work because of gig economy because people, what you'll have is you'll have the people at working for like delivery, uber, you know, so basically with no know were very limited rights such as we decided, yeah,

Speaker 2:          24:02          it's a reversal of all of the things that were fought for in the last name

Speaker 1:          24:05          tree. But with no one working for any money so that he knows that the other future that we might have these, these are, these are very radical changes to the structure of society and society that kind of, you know, maybe we're doing is going back to. We had to, we had a period of stability from 1940, roughly two, 19 the end of the nineties. So what we're doing is going back to that previous period, a period of huge human instability, you know, we call that that class the precariat, you know, we're all part of the precariat brick area instead of. Yeah. Instead of being a prototype area, it's beyond that. It's the ultimate precarious class. The global class.

Speaker 2:          24:48          One of the themes that I've noticed over the course of these podcasts is the way that power functions is to, as best as possible, more to facilitate its ongoing survival. Eg one slavery gets banned. It's like, oh, what is the best? It was the closest we can approximate slavery without using that word. Well, you could pay people next to nothing. And when you give a sort of like that car wash example is like that. And what concerns me when you use the silicone valley tech entrepreneur, new sovereignty of these great, powerful corporations that now dominate the globe, is that in this sort of, in their utopia, the, the problems of ordinary people are irrelevant. It doesn't mAtter that there is this gray in more first underclass almost not matter anymore. Now almost a missed that are just holding up reality.

Speaker 1:          25:37          Yeah. You have a kind of so much state of bliss which is kind of created by, you know, a mixture of, you know, pharmaceutical, you know, what you have is you have, you have a mental health crisis in britain, you have an unprecedented level of prescription drugs. You know, I interviewed A gp in blackpool, which is the, you know, which is the depression capital of britain. And I sort of said, you know, what, what did pharmaceutical drugs do here? What do antidepressants do? And she said, well, you could argue that they enable poverty, you know, what do they do, what do they do? I said, you know, do they enable poverty? And she said, that's such a complex question, but it could be, it could be the case that, you know, essentially what are we doing? Are we medicating people where they Can endure otherwise unbearable conditions and what is the consequence, you know, what, what are the social and economic consequences of that?

Speaker 1:          26:30          What are the consequences of obesity, which has its correlation with socioeconomic background, you know, what is the correlation with the creation of cheap, what we call disparaging a cheap white goods, the crash and the price of technology so that people are aBsolutely addicted, stuck to technology. You know, when essentially, you know, 25 years ago that technology was even beyond the, beyond their economic bracket, they weren't able to afford that stuff. Now this is kind of these big questions that I'm not saying I have the answers to, but these are the kinds of macro issues that we should be tackling and not, not kind of separating off, you know, fats over here and it's unconnected to pop in. Technology is unconnected to aspiration. Everything is connected and you have to understand that he's connected.

Speaker 2:          27:18          There's a mental health crisis, but the mental health crisis is excel. If a result of these, of this economic paradigm, that's incredible, so it's creating people that for whom life is unbearable and instead of going, oh, should we look at this economic model? simply drug the people that

Speaker 1:          27:39          swing mental health and your and your and your income. I mean blackpool is the is one of the most depressed cities in britain also has some the. There's a direct correlation between obesity and britain being the most overworked, underpaid country. I mean those two things are not, not an accident,

Speaker 2:          27:54          but even beyond the income jack is that the quality of life that people are living is if you are meaningless and your life is meaningless and you have no value and you have no purpose and your role in society is simply to consume knowing that you consumed, you are what you eat and what you eat a disposable products and you are a disposable product that that's getting juice. A huge existential crisis. I see. I have the image of like, you know, when you're dealing with a lawyer and like all the evidence points to live like in a minute, it's causing a mental health crisis that were just drug them. It's causing an ecological crisis. Don't worry, we'll go to the moon. It's like, well, why don't you deal with the actual thing of what you can't run life because a profit making machine because it's a struggle.

Speaker 1:          28:38          I think I see dead dead right, and I think there's a strong. I think the struggle that people don't realize they see capitalism as this monolithic evil. They don't. They think, oh, there's these companies are trying to screw everyone over. Actually, the reality is the real struggle now is not between workers and bosses. It's between ceos of companies who genuinely want to bring about change. There's poor. There's a guy who runs unilever and he said, well, I said, what's your greatest achievement? He says, to get rid of the hedge fund managers to get rid of short money, short term profit motive within this company. We have to do something about global warming. When you speak to them, they talked like they are occupied or something. They don't feel like they're the ceo of a global corporation. You know the and and the reason why is because they know that government can't do paris, paris climate changes of failure. Government can't do this stuff and it's almost like they think no one else can do it. We've got the power we have to do so. The struggle of the future will be business versus business. It'll be the business visions of people like mark zuckerberg who basically said essentially in that facebook thing that he put up, I am going to stand for president because now he's seen that trump can do his version versus trump's version. That's what you'll have. You'll have competing business visions of what the future should.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Except all of these people without human beings are nothing. The results, these ordinary people, unless someone can bypass that lets people say that the reason that you're engaged in this economic game is so that other people can benefit and facilitate and the only way to change it is to disengage from the economic gain and the only way you're going to be able to do that is by finding and alternative to making yourself feel better unless. And like for me, this is where religion becomes interesting because it's a model that exists outside economics. It was co opted by economics early. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:24          Was it a surprise that religion is fighting back when we look at religion in various forms as being the last. Basically there's no result, isn't it? It's no accident that Jihadism stands as a kind of, almost as a, as a sort of caliphate black flag alternative. That doesn't have to be the onLy alternative. But again, rather like trump, it's an inarticulated slightly incohesive difficult to comprehend version of an alternative

Speaker 2:          30:47          because fear, like on an emotional level, fear and desire of fact that they are irrational. You where people are being kept in an irrational state, uh, uh, to perpetuate. Consuming so fear and desire is basically what you're continually feeling. These are irrational state. So irrational, alternative, seem attractive. I like, you know, I think that trump was just deserts. If you, if you feed people that information continually jingoism tell people that nothing has any meaning, eventually you will get this mba, brexit at the same thing. I feel that the conditions were created for it. Now there are the, there are alternate alternate narratives. Even within this global context. I'm very interested in the example of China because they exist outside of our story. So can you tell us what this is?

Speaker 1:          31:30          China, China, China. You have the kind of, we know we're not talking about the different corporations and you have put in running China, uh, Russia plc, you've got, you know, trump like kind of failing chrysler of the United States, you know, like some mid, mid seventies corporation. Then if you look at China, china's quietly getting on with it. And the interesting thing is they'd squared the circle of democracy and you know, growth. They've, you know, when you go to davos, what you hear, you know, which is the meeting of the heads of government, every uBi annual meeting in Switzerland. The endless debate is how does democracy get in the way you know? is democracy compatible with the future? You know as though democracy is in crisis, there's endless discussion about democracy being in crisis in China. What happened in China, they basically state tiananmen square was the, was a, was a watershed because at that moment it appeared as if democracy was going to have to be the thing that the ruling party gave away to the middle class.

Speaker 1:          32:31          No, you don't need to do that. What you need to do is you need to sell them consumer goods. You need to move them into being an aspirant. We're middle class, like a western middle class. You can buy off any demands for democracy and so China squared that circle, how do we make consumer goods available in China? Used to be the workshop of the west so you know you'd always have light light. When I was a kid, I have my made in China, made in China. On the thing no longer now made it now, now it's china's turn to be like the west was and to become this, you know, the largest market in the world and essentially we produce or africa or wherever, India, whoever decides to be come the workshop for China produces cheap goods for China. China is the country that the planet now pivots on.

Speaker 1:          33:19          China basically bailed out the United States after the, after the subprime crash. So you know, it's basically like a giant hsbc loan, you know, China is the bank and that's really loud. Yeah. After that crash, trying twice, twice, China is bailed out the us. So that means America is in debt to China when you're talking about these secret deals that govern the world. So that is, that is happening on a net that is happening at the level of suffering or at least national states. Right. That's not always easy because because what you've got is you've got China are operating like a, like a corporation. So it's like your operation with a board. Yeah, like a highly successful corporation. But you know, what's interesting is the chinese, they have this last, actually this year, they launched obo, which is their grand plan for the future of the planet from bloody terrifying one belt, one road.

Speaker 1:          34:09          It's the recreation of the silk road, which was basically trade route to the wet, the trade route that connects the planet, globalized the planet. What they see is they see China creating a new silk road, but they're in charge. They also see the unprecedented need for a power in terms of, you know, the pollutant aspects of what's going to happen with growth. They see that being dealt with by not by an unprecedented rise in, in investment in global, uh, in, in, in solar and wind power. And so they also, there's sort of a weird combination of ultra frightening and ultra optimistic. It's like you don't know which way, you don't know which way they're going to go and you don't quite know how to read it. It's kind of a combo of the two. I have two questions. One is how did they avoid them?

Speaker 1:          34:57          Ocracy Just fruit consumers. And what did they do? Just basically the end, you know, tiananmen square marked was, it was a cataLyst in terms of our men who was a major, major plans on the street. The man would have shopping bags in front of a tank, will never forget that guy. Yeah, but how did that, like I said, that people were demanding, we want to be invite engaged in power and spite. Instead it was like, no, no, no, you can have, but how do you actually do. What does that actually mean? I think because how do you do is you create, I mean, in a way the, the, you know, China has a very deep seated with a very deep rooted belief in the states, in loyalty to the state, the individual and the state being as one. they come from this idea, that doctrine of the mean, which is an asian principle.

Speaker 1:          35:39          The, you know, essentially the, any kind of dispute, a dispute between you and I. You're not right. I'm not right. But the solution lies in the middle, in a place that neither you nor. I have thoughts. So it's a kind of, it's the doctrine of the main is a, is a kind of, it's a, it's a philosophy of how you deal with problems, how you deal with solutions. We come from a kind of completely different. We come from the enlightenment, from the idea of a discourse, me putting my argument, you put in your argument either your right or I'm right, so it's combatative, you know, which was the dialectic, you know. So we come from a completely different place. So there's a sort of a spirit functional thing. It's a fun. It's a fundamentally part of what it is to be chinese is this notion.

Speaker 2:          36:23          Yes. And that would not have been, that wouldn't have been underwritten by ideas of statehood initially. That would havE been sort of self and otherness. The original confusion.

Speaker 1:          36:34          Well the rice field being this really important thing to riceville being a sort of symbol of the state so that the grains of rice, I like the citizens, they all part of the greater good of the state and that you understand that your places as part of the state. Whereas we have, we don't have, don't have that notion for. We have the notion that the hunter gatherer or the, you know, we haven't

Speaker 2:          36:56          ritualistic. Yeah, and individualistic sense. Yeah. So China has sort of philosophical roots that are gonna help them prevail that because we, because of our identity myths of individualism stitched into them. So like how bay still pretty. Presumably it's a stratified society. China, they've sort of diverted from any idea of sort of equality.

Speaker 1:          37:24          Yeah. Well it's interesting isn't it? Because you have, you have already used, you still have demands for rights, you still have a middle class, you still have, you'll still. The human beings will always demand what human beings do bond. And so I think the situation for China, and I'm not an expert on China, but you know, if you get one in, it'd be very interesting to hear what they have to say about this, but it seems to me that the future for China lies in there. They're very cleverly avoiding the western route. They don't wAnt to take the route that the United States to. They don't want to be the country. That became a super power and then went into decline. And so, and I think part of that key to that is staying true to the philosophy and just this year, uh, you know, you know, jumping has basically become a, the ultimate. He's, he's given himself the highest accolade, you know, he's the new now. So he's absolutely total total power over the state. He is the state

Speaker 2:          38:19          what he's trying his relationship with corporations then like they have the image that we have. It's

Speaker 1:          38:25          fascinatinG. It's really interesting because if you look at how western corporations bend themselves towards the chinese market because what they see is they see the biggest market on the world in the world. And so how do we, how do we go into that market, you know, apple, google that you see that they have their own versions of all the tech brands that we already have. So to some degree do they need to, do they need to even have our tech brands, they don't need to acres anymore. Chinese have no sense of needing to eight the west anymore, you know, they're doing their own thing in gene in. Um, uh, all the, the gene editing that they're doing now, the crispr benign stuff, I don't know if you know about all that, but it's basically they absolutely leading the world, you know, so it's that, that's, there's no sense in which I think we patronizingly looked at China was like, you know, how is it going to develop, how is it going to leap progress? Well, it's just going to, they just think about the world in a different way from us.

Speaker 2:          39:22          I say it's not a, a narrative that exists as a comparative except from our perspective. They have their own original, the ideology that is distinct and separate and now I'm no longer needs to see itself in daily active discourse with our western narrative. And in fact, according to their own natures and your motif, they have a self contained ideology where the individual and the state can have a harmonious relationship and this is going to be hugely beneficial for them going forward. And the thing that you said a moment ago about, uh, the combustible force of a growing underclass and dissatisfied middleclass. I'm very interested in gaging and understanding these forces. One thing that is interesting to me is with the diesel, with this sort of a sort of recent attempt to reengage national identity, that would be the examples we've mentioned, trump, brexit, it's stuff that's happening throughout europe and it's a aids I'm distilling to fail.

Speaker 2:          40:22          These ideas. People marching in charlottesville aren't going to get what they want. People that will want to reimpose a national identity, they're not going to get what they want. The sort of source satisfaction and pain will continue and many of the examples that you've given across this show of like health crisis, agricultural crisis, they all point to the power of these transnational corporations. Now when people are saying what we want is to condemn migrants, they are simply another symptom of the problem that you have diagnosed. How do you think we can engage the energy of the basically everybody in the world. How do you direct that? How do you tell this story? How? What have you learned?

Speaker 1:          41:06          You know, It's all. I make these series and I try to analyze and as objective as possible how things work, you know, how the world works and what people say to me every single time is what are the solutions, what's your solution to this, what do we do? And in a way that is enough that people ask that question because we're at a moment where we can't talk about revolution in the 20th century way. We can't talk about people going to the barricades and deciding that they're going to take over the post office or something that isn't going to happen.

Speaker 1:          41:46          We're going, we're going to a space where, you know, it's, it's, it's that thing that you mentioned earlier about the supermicro and the super macro. It's kind of, we laugh when we put stuff in our recycling bin, but you know, I went to detroit and went to camden, New Jersey, which is the most poverty stricken system was crime ridden city in America. People are moving there because it's super cheap. It's like basically you've got people starting up businesses like you know, and you just think, you know, there's kind of something. They're growing vegetables in their front door. There's something kind of laughable and laudable and brilliant at the same time about people just doing stuff for themselves. It's almost a kind of millennial generational sort of reaction to this idea that you've got to be on twitter and facebook and whatever it is endlessly, you know, it's a kind of almost like a progressive luddite.

Speaker 1:          42:38          Autism or something, you know? Do you see what I mean? You know, the kind of techno prairie, someone said, oh, you were on the techno prairie. We're all got wifi, but I'm growing carrots. You know, it's kind of like, I think that's, I think there's going to be 50 different strains of rebellion against the system. Whatever the hell the system is, you know, and I think it'll take the form of those guys who have just bought one inch of the trump wall. You know, today they've decided to buy a meter of the ground where trump plans to build a wall across Mexico and they've said we're going to make it legally impossible for him to do. So that is a clever lateral way of rebelling. And I think that that's what human beings are doing all the time. You know, I try to buy south the a kind of present way.

Speaker 1:          43:22          I try to basically the, the, the franchise was up for southeastern railways was most failing british railway and the commuters have a miserable time. I said to the bbc and the communities, why don't we try and run the railway ourselves? Why don't we bid for the franchise? We put together a bit just from all the people who are on the train. You had expertise on the train of like you had nurses, care workers, accountants, every conceivable a hedge fund managers, every conceivable person brought together for the purposes of a common good. And the department of transport turned it down just simply because we weren't. They said we hadn't gone through the right hoops, but essentially we put together a credible plan which was then taken on board by them. And you think that's kind of the future. Thinking laterally, thinking differently, connecting with people in unexpected ways and who the hell knows what will happen?

Speaker 2:          44:17          Revolution, I suppose is taking your power back is saying, I'm going to have my power. I'm not going to defer it. I'm not going to subscribe to other peoples ideas and systems and whether it is a growing vegetables on a tech now prairie or to participate economically. It's this sense that you have authority and authorship of your own life. Something you said earlier about the cic. I was themselves sort of wanting to resolve these problems I find quite inspiring because all of these systems and ideas are built upon people and are resourced by people and require people in order to pop to perpetuate themselves. And what that makes me think, jack is that the. If you can buy what people are trying to do, like the ass end of this neck in antidepressants, in blackpool and in bad salty, sugary food and buying crap disposable goods. They trying to feel good. They're trying to feel happy and the system that they are trying to process these feelings through to no longer provide for them. So I, I feel that what you said, like the weather, you know, there'll be 50 different ways that the important, the, the how is not important. The thing that's important is that you just start to, that you started,

Speaker 1:          45:28          you know, it's a very middle class. I hate people in a way who are engaged in politics because to me it's quite a bourgeois kind of. It's quite an, it's quite an interesting thing that we even think we have the luxury of sitting here. Like we are discussing these things. Most people are just trying to survive and you buy a bag of chips after having done a 16 hour shift. You don't give a toss about global economics or corporations and sewing, but you want one thing you want is what you said is you want your life to be better. And it sorts of, that's why you know, changing your life and doing it at the micro level is kind of revolutionary because that's what matters to people. That's actually what matters.

Speaker 2:          46:07          It seems abstract because in some senses, you know, we live in infinite space, but we also live in camden, New Jersey. The idea of infinite space or the globe is all be abstract. It's nice that we know it, but the fact is we live in ourself. We live in our community and we need to have different relationships at that.

Speaker 1:          46:23          That's really community. You see, when, uh, when I was in the agenda, the reason I had this sort of slightly without sounding too weird, I had to kind of epiphany moment where I was sort of in the street and you've got like drug dealers cavorting around on like chilled children's bikes and things. It's just sofas in the middle of the road. It's just like the, you know, it's like a joke. It's like the wire but for real and you're sort of there. And there was this guy and he was like, he was busking and he was like on a street corner and I had a lollipop. It had broken up guitar, which he put put tape on and he was using the lollipop as a plectrum and I thought, no one's gonna. No one's gonna give you like an entrepreneur. No one's going to give you money like the most depressed place in the world.

Speaker 1:          47:04          He was giving it a go. Do you know what I mean? He was like giving a gun. I thought, my god, it's like you walk down a street, any street in britain or anywhere in the world and you see 50 businesses, some of which will fail, some of which are and it's like all of them. Somebody had some crazy idea to start a business and they've had a go and you think there's something sort of inspiring. I think about the idea of people. Then utilizing that spirit, that human spirits to survive, but then doing something together and everyone who was in new in camden in New Jersey said to me, the reason we moved here is because of community. They said, we feel connected to the other businesses. We are all together trying to make the community work. We're employing local people employed. I spoke to the guy, worked and worked and he said I would 100 percent be dead.

Speaker 1:          47:51          He was drug dealer, drug dealer for 20 years. He ended up getting a job for the first time, this place. He said, I would 100 percent be debt if these 2:19 year olds haven't come here and started this print works and you think, and he and they and they were only hiring people from, from, from that side, maybe rebuilding community. What do we have in britain? We have isolated, isolated, atomize people who don't know their neighbors, don't know anyone, old people who live in solitary lives and unconnected to anyone. Building community is really at the heart of what could happen.

Speaker 3:          48:19          We unthinkingly submit our ingenuity to a preexisting system that has I hot, not as you said earlier, as a machiavellian intent, but just as it's a. I'm thinking emma, our subjugation it. So immediately you say our business is gonna make money in order to. And the other problem built in is that we still try to use sort of state solutions. Well, the state will prevent transnational corporate. Well, we now know that can't happen except in China, but it has an entirely different anthropological origin. So it seems to me that what a lot, because I. This is the bloody thing that's all for that that prevents me from being simply a narcissist is the I deeply deeply care that people are suffering in this way, is something about it makes me very unhappy and furiously angry. I kind of believe it's possible for it to change that. Yeah, you must do is you want to ask around, make noise, documentaries. Would you put yourself ruled out buddy grief when you could be shopping the misses and your mother In law, but this is.

Speaker 1:          49:21          We all care, but it's just that everyone cares because we human beings aren't. We see a woman who run coca cola said to me, look, I'm. She said to me, I am, you know, it's accused the company of creating obesity and so on, you know, the high fructose corn syrup and all the rest of it. and she turned to me and she said, yes, we did all that. We didn't know what we were going to do. We didn't know that was going to be the end result. And then she turned to me. She said, I am a mother. And I thought that was an interesting thing to say because she was sort of saying, I am a human being. Please be reminded, I am human, I understand the consequences of these decisions. And that is, you kind of have to hope that that's, you know, interesting, interesting.

Speaker 3:          50:03          Like remind yourself this because like you know, a minute ago you said that thing about like, you know, sort of, you know, if you've found this 16 hour shift scaffolding or whatever, you probably are going to just have some chips and not think about or listened to. The russell brand podcast they use is what you should be doing for him to actually making it for you. If you're a scaffold the police or anything like that, you don't feel connected to sort of abstract ideological ideas. But the reality is like your primary identity, it will be able to see a of coke or a scaffold that is that I'm a father, I'm a brother, I'm a mother, I'm a sister, a daughter. So like I don't like know. It's weird because we do these things were supposed to be talking about brexit or wherever. And I think brexit don't impact my life as much as some shit. My daughter might have said this morning or my dog, we humans, we're. We live in human lives. These are ideological things. As long as they're not impeding on our lives, they should be kept in the abstract. So. And I think the only way to do that is that, gosh, this is may seem somewhat bloody reductive given who I'm talking to you, but it's to somehow replicate the communal unit. But we would tend to, if unimpeded by post agricultural ideological forms that benefit elites and inhabit and subjugate ordinary.

Speaker 1:          51:17          That connotes really spot on in the sense often thing, and it's kind of really weird, but I often think about the kind of freud in emotional underpinning of capitalism. You know how everything is really emotion. They really, even these, even like we're all sitting here, gareth's not saying a word, you're sitting over up, but there's a kind of like, it's a sort of dance. Everything is a kind of really nuanced, psychological dance. I'm talking to you, you're talking to me. We're kind of getting on. But he could have gone badly and it could have been, it could have like it could have rested on one thing you said or something. I did. It's absolutely tiny tiny decisions that can have massive implications. You think if you applied that to economics, you applied that to the decisions that corporations make whereby you appeal to the humanity of people. You deal with people on an emotional level and I've seen this actually does have an effect. We kind of overplay the hard money side and we underplay the weird emotional psychological side

Speaker 3:          52:19          because both of those things are resourced by the prime or the desire to gain resources has a prime or engine. Yeah. Like it's almost like I feel that philosophically is psychologically. It's like, excuse me, that you want to navigate people to their, to their cradle and their deathbed continually like you were born once and you were going to die. Now that's, let's accept that basis and make decisions from there. Not continually in there, but I'm the ceo and by wednesday we've got a pie chart or whatever it is they have now. Is that like, you know, take these people that come up with these ludicrous maxims and ideas and all night, so an opportunity that the, the, the earth's only got 60 harvest in it. I go, no, no, no, you're going to die. You cannot, you know, and that's why the reason that I am interested in religion is not because of the sort of a bizarre cultural artifacts of the cruise as a result of its time of origin or the ludicrous prejudice that one flies.

Speaker 3:          53:11          No, but because it's dealing with the fundamental you're born, you're going to die. You've experienced things that seem to be very similar from what other people are experiencing. Can we build systems on that basis and because I suppose there are sort of differences between. It seems that what we require our communities that are of a certain size where the, the individual members of that community have power within that community. The other communities are earnouts to be run according to their own values. And that the idea of that being on a national level these days is finished because it's too many people to do it. So. And the state no longer has the legitimacy of being the thing that defends us from the, I don't know, the barbarians, whether those are corporate barbarians or barbarians that are outside of our

Speaker 1:          53:53          sovereignty hundred per se. It's like aristotle. Lillian, isn't it? You're basically saying you're making an argument for the greek polis, for the, for the city state a state that aristotle said hat to have a defined boundary in terms of its size, number of inhabitants, for it to work economically. It could only work at this scale. Any bigger. It becomes corrupted, it becomes destroyed. You know? It's kind of interesting, isn't it? How far have we come?

Speaker 3:          54:18          That is the argument I'm making. It might be a bit even smaller than eight because of a chimps can only handle 75. People say it's like an arab city. Well, under the skin is finally reached the conclusion. It's a city full of chimps scratching themselves, picking stuff out of each other's hair and doing things that chimps do. So your book a don, the secret deals that are changing the world is out now. It is noW. Now,

Speaker 1:          54:47          apparently. Yeah. I knew the paperbacks are in february, but it's out now.

Speaker 3:          54:50          Get this book. I'll be getting it and reading it. Don't feel mad and weird and conflicted that you're probably buying it from amazon. Simply accepts that this is the way the world is now. I say thank god for capitalism was what would we be doing? You'll be listening to this on your iphone. You'll be buy my book and jack's book from amazon and hopefully they figure just kind listlessly plugged in a carrot in your front garden that actually the seed was made by monsanto and it's copyrighted.
