Speaker 1:          00:00          And if we can somehow extract what is positive from a, what is called religion, that it might, it leads us to ideas such as fraternity, unity, oneness, compassion, and like, uh, we do you not find a and connections between what you have learned in neuroscience and what you have learned from studying sort of Buddhism?

Speaker 2:          00:25          Oh yeah. The connections are very direct, but

Speaker 1:          00:29          how they know that stuff,

Speaker 2:          00:30          but we will, but we don't want just because it's, it's just the nature of consciousness is the, you're talking about people who spent, especially in the Buddhist case, a, just an incredible amount of time studying from, um, from the first person side what experiences, like what his character is. The central claim of Buddhism is not just Buddhism but, but Buddhism. And I would put several of the Indian traditions like Advaita Vedanta in there with the central claims that the, the self is an illusion. The EGO is an illusion. Where. And when I say self, I don't mean that people are illusions. I mean that the sense that you have a subject riding around in your head thinking your thoughts rather than that there's a thinker in addition to the thoughts. That's an illusion and that makes perfect sense neurologically because there's no. There's no place in the brain for your ego to be sitting.

Speaker 2:          01:23          There's no central place where everything comes together. There's no unchanging center in the brain. You're just talking about a cascade of neurophysiology and everything is distributed everywhere and it's not a and there are various parts of the brain that are coming online and off and and and subserving conscious dates and not. It's, it's a, it's a process and there is there. If you could experience consciousness as a flow of sensory and emotional and interoceptive experience without a. The sense that there's an unchanging center riding around on that flow, right? Like a man in a boat on the, on the stream of consciousness. If you could experience that consciousness without that, that would be an experience that is much more coincidence with what we understand neurologically. That would be. That would be to experience something that is more true from the third person brain based, what do we see inside the head side, and it just so happens you can't experience that.

Speaker 2:          02:30          That is just. That is how that is what meditation is like when you really know how to meditate. This sense that there's a meditator in the head strategically paying attention to experience rather than just pure experience that drops away. Right? So that's this one. That's one piece of data in favor of, of the of introspection here and it's not. It's not a piece that the western intellectual tradition or the West or the western spiritual tradition ever got a good hand handle on. I mean, so yes, you can find specific Christian and Jewish and Muslim mistakes making these noises, but they make the. When they make these noises sufficiently, they start to sound like Buddhists and they're co-religionists want to kill them rather often. Religionists powerful within nation states in economic life, people stopped believing they're not individuals. It's very out to market at them.
