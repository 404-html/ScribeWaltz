Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello, you're listening to under the skin with me, bro. Nah, y'all listen to me, Russell brand and I'm talking to Professor David. I'm assuming professor can drop the professor. I don't like it very much. Oh, professor. Hey. I've come up in the world. Professor David Harvey. I'll be talking to as if we was equals that David Harvey Professor David Harvey is the world's leading Marxist thing. Go. That's what it says. See, I've just, I'm just reading the script might, I'm just reading the script. He writes extensively on Marxists, geography, social justice, and the political economy and is the author of over 20 books including 17 contradictions in the end of capitalism, rebel cities and the new imperialism is a distinguished professor of anthropology and geography at the graduate center of the city, University of New York and has been teaching Marx's Kapital for almost 40 years. His new book is titled Marx Capital and the Madness of economic reason. Professor David Harvey, Frankie, very much for being our guest on under the skin. You'll hear somewhat to promote this book, Marx capital and the madness of economic reason. Why you, why have you written this book? And now?

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       Well, I'm, I've been involved over several years now what I call the mark's project, which is to try to explain to people what it was mark's was talking about and to do it in terms which are simple without being simplistic. It's been quite a challenge to do that has this marks is kind of a bit of a hard read when you first read him. But a lot of academics spend a lot of their time trying to make marks more complicated than it already is. So I'm trying to make it simpler so that people can grasp it. And I had a series of books which have come out. And this is uh, the last one and it may not be the final one, but it, uh, I tried to put a lot of things together in this book about what the, what's going on in the three volumes of capital, how will they relate to how the three volumes relate to each other and, and how coming out of that you get a picture of capitalist society and the essence of what capital is about. Uh, so that's what I'm trying to do in the book and I'm hoping that people will pick it up and read it and give a good shot at understanding it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Given your stated objective of making capital more accessible, perhaps we'll start this conversation with a paps illuminating a few simple terms and ideas. So I'll go through these questions because this is an important topic and we've looped into this cause are preemptive chat. I was really getting off on, but I would like to make sure that we build sufficient foundations. Firstly, why you're not calling it das kapital like how you're supposed to,

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       um, well I'm using the English translation so I usually English language to talk about it. There are some problems about the translation and obviously now that's what I'm working from.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Hey cause it I suppose because of that brief to simplify it. Firstly why he's based book so important. I mean capital and though your book and think is important as well. I'm not trying to belittle your book. I said why is capital and then why is it an important book? What's in there that's relevant to people today in 2017 after we have in jewelry, their idea, their negative stories about communism. Why is this? But why is capital one important thing for us to understand? Now,

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       you know, capitalism book is not about communism. Oh it's a, I was about as a critique of capitalism and there's not even a critique of capitalism and every respect. It's a, it's a critique of how, what I would call the engine of capitalist development, uh, works. Uh, how the laws of accumulation of capital work cause capitalism expansionary system is constantly expanding. And how does it expand and what kind of stresses does that do that does that create amongst working people? What kind of stresses in relationship to cultural evolution, what kind of stress is in relationship to environmental questions and, and, and the like. And we're surrounded obviously with all of those questions about the environment, about cultural preservation, about even the definition of what it is means to be a human being. They having a big debate about that and the United States right now because everybody looks at trump and says, is that the future of what humanity is going to look like? And the answer many people, there's no, we got to think of something really different. So, so with all of those questions around, uh, you need to know what it is that is driving capitalism, uh, to do the kinds of things it does in relationship to exploitation, the environment, social inequality, cultural transformations, the production of new wants, needs and desires, all of those sorts of things. We need to have a theory of that. And Mark's is the first person, and we're ready to come to terms with what that theory might look like

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       in the 1850s mark's was able to identify in this critique of capitalism, what likely trends and what the result of capitalism would be. Even though this is like, you know, 150 years ago, that's when the reasons you've written the book, isn't it? Even at 150 years ago, it was able to predict what was it about capitalism then that made it evident that this economic system,

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       well, first, first, first, and it has to grow. It has to grow with the, what we call a compound, right? Which is kind of a 3% per year is a small amount of, uh, new commodities and so on back in 1850. But by the time you get to 2000, it's a huge amount of new commodities. So it's got to grow and at some point, or rather it's gonna hit limits to that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       In the end. That's quite a simple observation. Yeah. And Mark's made then, because if you change the word capitalism to the word elephant, then

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       in [inaudible] it is the elephant has to continue to grow. It's going to fill the room and kill us all. Like you just pointed out. Yeah, no, it's a, it's a growth machine and it has to grow because that's the only way in which you kind of show a profitability profit is an access. Yes. And they have to produce the access in order for capital smart and then you have to use that access to produce more access. So they say it's endless. Accumulation is one of the rules of the game necessarily and essentially impractical filling. A practical need is about creating needs that are not there order that it might continue to have compound growth. So how come that that observation was made in 1850 how covert and then go, oh yeah, that's a good point, right? Stop this capitalism then. Well, because there's plenty of room to expand back in 1850 I mean the rest of the world was there and of course we are to colonialism.

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       We had imperialism, we had all of the expansions around the world, so there's plenty of room for that growth to occur. Uh, there was a, what I call a capital was getting into what I call a special fix a lot of the time, which is what we're capable of doing. Super amount of commodities, uh, and, and, and capacity and Britain. So I wouldn't know what to do with it. So, uh, the British would lend to Argentina to build railroads and the railroads will be produced in Britain. So yeah, so Argentina gets caught into the kind of the circulation of capital. So, so there were plenty of places like that for capital to grow into. But now there's no place left. I mean, maybe Africa still is not completely gone, but pretty much everywhere in the world has been caught into it right now. So growth from here on out is not feasible when it was feasible back in 1850.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       All right. So, even if someone has said out in a minute, if we have to, if we have to indefinitely grow this ideology, it will necessarily bring about destruction and the responses I was now bie cheese, no one was bothered. Well you know, back then, uh, you know United States was only just beginning and and yeah they all United States, continent sort of and the North American continent to get to occupy. Would I be right then in asking David and beyond dry and more importantly than right. Bloody clever in asking that uh, that capitalism a sourced from imperialism and colonialism is an economic model that fits the proceeding ideology which had been a rather more obviously in ethical system of domination. Yeah. I ran a capital has always been about geographical expansion. Now, whether you call it colonialism or you call imperialism, I actually prefer to call it and even geographical development because sometimes imperialism makes it is too simple a term cause cause right now if you look at the way in which commodities are made, you know, one piece is made in Taiwan and one lady says made in South Korea and other pieces made in Mexico and then it's all put together in the United States and you say, where is capital in all of this?

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       So right now it's a much more complicated kind of story. So I kind of saying, well where's, where's, where's all this work going? But she's producing the commodities again on our table. And one of the questions I always like to start by geography classes off with was questions of where does your breakfast come from? And it was kind of really interesting. People can't go, oh I never thought about it. And they, they kind of say well it comes from the supermarket and you had no, no, no. I want to feel aware there's all this stuff come from. And, and after about three weeks of asking the same question and people will say things like, I didn't have breakfast this morning, it's now telling me this question but I don't like this question and I'll let me my breakfast and no, I'm not hungry. More of a puzzle that rain. When did that crowd the cloud accumulate and why was that card that I'm not coming to your classes anymore. No, that's exactly right. That's how I, I got a lot of dropouts from my geography class cause I kept asking that question.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       But in a way a capitalism is a vehicle for a particular type of mentality, which is kind of about what,

Speaker 2:          00:09:50       well it's uh, you know, the famous kind of statement, the greed is good. There's that kind of a side bar about Ashley. The mentality now is shifted a bit because I think a lot of capitalism is, is about a complicated relationship with the data's and I, one of the things that are talking about in this last book a lot is the way in which the future has got foreclosed by debt. Bad debt is a claim on future labor. And it's a claim on your future library and if you heavily in debt, you've got to pay it off. So the incentive you have right now is not took on is is getting rid of the debt. I said

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       I'm supposed to be rich and I'm in slave.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       Yeah, well this is exactly, this is exactly right. It's about foreclosure and it's about, it's about not emancipating you at all. It's about imprisoning you in a network of a debt relations which have become very different. That's why, you know, student debt, I'm in states now, we've got these horrible amount of student debt, which really full close is the future for people for new in remarkable ways.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       If you couldn't remove morality from the lens of analysis in a source of ingenious in it's mendacity in a number of ways in which he dominating.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       Yeah. By the way, Mark's does not make a moral argument. No, it's not a really, essentially a moral argument they'd seize. It's about the inevitability of mendacity.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       Cool. [inaudible] bearing might like then, this is still the simple bit of the podcast for me and one to z, but that is the difference between socialism, Marxism and communism. Is there a quick way of doing that?

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       Well, socialism I think is generally spoken. Alvarez, a transitional a system and which capitalism has put down a sufficient constraints so that you have social democracy and it's, and I think traditionally it was seen as a stepping stone to full communism where, which would lead to the abolition of the class relation between and labor and the abolition of class privilege. And eventually of course the abolition of the capitalist state apparatus. So communism is seen as something, a further stage going beyond, uh, we're, we're, whereas under socialism, elements of the capitalism would still exist. The market system was still be their money of the sort of what we use. And cumulate was still be there, but under social, under communism, a lot of that would then disappear. Marxism, for me anyway, is, is a mode of analysis as a way of thinking, which is a critical way of thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       And, and it, it says to you when he, when he got some sort of situation and you want to try to understand what the hell is happening, you don't get to see by surface appearances, you don't get to see it by ideological kind of bluster. You get, you could do an analysis and for yourself and you come up with an understanding of what's really going on here. And when you understand what's really going on here, you can then act against what is really happening in a, in a deep way rather than simply deal with surface symptoms.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       I see subcutaneous analysis, not just observation of symptoms. When you observe the symptoms, you're necessarily confined by the argument. The Arthur.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       Yeah. One of the things mark said was if, if, if, uh, you know, if everything was as it seemed to be on the surface, there will be no need for science. So we look at the, we look at the sun and it looks like the sound's going around the earth, but we find out, well it isn't, you know, it's rotating. So I'm just another business. Write that down. This is Iowa. So that's why, that's why mark's means by appearance, uh, and, and then the reality behind it. So it's, uh, and, and you know, most scientists, I think we recognize there's a difference between symptoms and you know, what the underlying causes and those medical practitioners would, would recognize that difference. And Mark's is trying to do a kind of constantly trying to do a forensic kind of inspection of a capitalist system to find out what these symptoms which you see on the surface, like increasing inequality, where, where those symptoms are coming from in terms of was producing them.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Yeah. I see. I see. Um, may I ask when a law recently we spoke to Al Gore, we spoke to Al Gore about climate change, Al Gore, uh, talking to us about like how, you know, in a sense, I suppose he's a raise on debt sre and explicit mission, which seems to have some nobility about it is to galvanize and enthuse people about being sort of responsible. But when I was talking to Al Gore are kept thinking and in fact saying, yeah, but hold on a minute. If you need that to stop, can't you do the best and they've got to be sort of some stern, I'm definitive regulation of that. Otherwise it will just carry on like an then this guy's regular like defy in an absolute regulation of energy companies, certain kinds of traits, certain kinds of labor. So in in the capitol, is it dealing with my same, well it's no point just asking. People have you know, turn the tap off, are they clean their teeth? It's much more important than say, well you can't have that amount of profit. You can't operate in that way. He's that way. He's that Crista does that critique?

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       Yeah, that does. That's a very good point. I mean what my view of a Al Gore is he thinks that you can actually solve the climate change problem within the parameters of a capitalist system and that he doesn't want to do away with capitalism and we spray is trying to protect capitalism from the consequences of climate change. Whereas I take the view that a, the main producer of climate change is of course the driving force of capital accumulation. And until you've dealt with the driving force of capital accumulation, you're going to get all these promises about new technologies which are going to solve the problem and so on. Uh, but you're not going to get a fundamental kind of a solution without challenging capital itself.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       So it's kind of futile, isn't it? And it's sort of sort of using the means of a kind of a contemporary consumer society in that it's about your individual choice and usually individually recycle and individually do they make these kind of choices? Um, there's a thing I'm very interested in and I keep asking people about it and they don't know. So I'll ask you, there's this thing I read. Gandy said they went, this is him that point ass kicking out the British and then ash just doing their job for him. Uh, what India is a country of 70,000 villages that's built on craft economies where everybody works all the time. We have to focus less on mass production and think instead of production for the masses, and to do this, we're going to have to break out spell. We've commodification as long as people are thinking we've got to get more and more stuff, we're going to be in trouble. Now that is where it starts to interface with the individual bottle. Like this thing he said about 70,000 village each one or to po it, autonomous, independent and trading only in access and being where possible. Self-Sufficient. What's he saying there? Candy is this, is that

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       it's, it's a utopian vision in some ways and I'm not against Utopian visions. You need that water if you were right utopia. Oh you do? Oh, I know. I kind of like a little bit of Utopian.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       No, I love it. I don't, I don't entirely lie on, I own

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       it. And, and I think that that, that, well, well candy's saying is that there is a way of organizing production and consumption, which is radically different from that, which is given by the industrialization model. And he was faced with a, you know, Nairu and develop mentalism which was to bring in factories and solve the problem that way. And a Gandy saying no, there was another kind of solution where I think there's a, there's a problem with that is in a situation of very strong population change and population growth. Yeah, the 70,000 villages were all but the growing and then, uh, and there are other issues which arise like, uh, how, how do you, how do you deal with local famines under circumstances, that kind of man, if you get crop failures amongst say, 20,000 villages in the said part, and how do you support, uh, what happens there?

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       So the, the haze assumption is that they'll never be a crop failure. Whereas historically there are crop failures because of climate issues and her malpractices and things like that. So you need to have, uh, an organization that can deal with the, with the possibility of crop failures and, and, and can redistribute wealth between the villages when it's, when it's really necessary. And the other difficulty is when they're independent and autonomous villages, some of the villages will start to get very afterward and very rich and some of them will get very poor. What are you going to do about the inequalities of income is between different villages. Gandy didn't think about those sorts of things. And I, and I think you have to think about form of organization will put all those village economists together. So you've believed that in Arcos into Elysium, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, I suppose a version of what Gandy was talking you could go to and our coasts and colorism from, from, from what he's talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:18:55       I don't think he would want no bad at all, but, but, but you could move in that direction. And of course there's a lot of interest these days in solidarity economies and autonomous development and this place and uh, you know, and as a coach, it's a great faith in autonomy at the seminar. Our autonomy is going to be the solution. Am I answer to that is, I think autonomy is a good thing when you know what you're doing with it, but it's not the solution. Because if you don't have autonomy relations between autonomous groups, you're going to get a great deal of any quality. You're going to get the famine problem, you're going to get all sorts of issues with this kind, uh, which have to be sold by, by integrating a local economies with each other in such a way that they can some mutually support each other in times of difficulty.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       And so it is a, it's a, presumably what you're agreeing for Wa capital is arguing for is that the, the role of the state, but the state has to have a benevolent and redistributive role and all that done. There has to be, well put it this way, they have to be mechanisms of a redistribution and, and, and the like and, and mutual support. And that has to be organized. Now when he used the term state, we often think about the capitalist state and I don't like the capitalist state, but we do need a form of governments and governmental inter interventions. And I like some of these things where they talk about, you know, [inaudible] for example, and this idea about municipal socialism or, and, and, and local socialism days, you'd have autonomous, uh, assemblies. But then there will be a super assembly that we would start to deal with the relations between and, and then he'd have a super, super assembly in which, uh, yeah, what's happening in, say North America gets connected was, was happening in South Africa and, and issues like climate change are addressed because you need an a, a global organization to deal with.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       The climate change problem is going to be dealt with simply by everybody changing behavior, as you mentioned earlier. So you need, so you need some form of, of governmental structure of coordination. Uh, and I, and I think, uh, uh, the autonomy argument is, is powerful up to a point, but it needs to go much further. When I say that, then people say, oh, you're in favor of the capitalist state and you just want to, you can get a state power and we know the state is a disaster and yes, where the current state is a disaster, it's an instrument of capitalist domination. I'm also, I think now that it was even in the 19th century and we see it being a militarize so it can suppress social opposition and social movements and, and so, you know, I, I'm, I'm really against the kind of capitalist state, but, but that doesn't mean I'm against some sort of form of government, uh, look and deal with these much broader global kind of problems. How will do you,

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       how would we ever arrive at that? How would they, how would we have a form of state that was benevolent and acting in the interests of its population? And can you now answer a question and you must be continually called upon to answer that, where like I'm glad that you did this distinctions between socialism, Marxism and communism and it, how do you address the great failures of communism in the last century?

Speaker 2:          00:22:07       Well, first off, I don't think necessarily the communism was a great failure. Uh, I mean, I called her, you know, style and is good. Lacks. Yeah. Well, yeah, there were some very, very bad parts of that history. Uh, on the other hand, I think what was interesting was after the collapse of the Soviet Union, life expectancy in the Soviet Union went down in Russia know enormously. A lot of people, they're suddenly found all their rights or disappeared. I mean, so, so I think we are wrong to kind of say everything that the communist dead was, was, was, was terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Mostly I've been propagandized to live there. My perception of what happened in the car communist union, that century has been totally realized and I don't really understand it cause it does. I mean cause I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       Yeah, look at, look I'm not, I don't want to get in a situation of saying everything was great and wonderful and a no criticism. But if you look at a place like Cuba and you look at the health care delivery in Cuba, it's fantastic as well. Education, you know, and, and so there's some very good things.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Awesome, good things. And, but like I think we have to address that. Some of the things that seem like I was always good fan on the telly once with a woman that was doing a documentary said it seems that communism in Soviet communism unconsciously or inadvertently mimicked this, the social structure that immediately proceeded it czar Islam in the, in spite of its declared objectives, it has a hierarchal structures and did lead to oppression and persecution of a cliff.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       Yeah. No, I mean I mean I don't, I don't deny that a lot that, but I do think that, oh we have to give credibility to some of the things that happened on the commute or something. The other thing I have to say is this a, the reason that most of us have the standard of living we have today is because of the communist threat. If the communist threat and not being there after 1945 you know, we wouldn't have had the delivery of the welfare state such as it was and all those kinds of things which allow us increasing life expectancy. And it's interesting. They are, over the last few years, life expectancy has been going down in some of the major capitalist countries. Britain, for example, Cameron, I think as the first prime minister to leave with a lower life expectancy, the money came in.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Well I think he's, he's gone up, you should say the armed guards outside his house. Nothing's happening or that gazer let me tell you, it is how bill crawling around everywhere and there's an ambulance on got. I can't, that was having to anyone else elaborate grove. I must be terrified. All hell bill or outside one else. Right. But Look, David, this is a thing and it goes on basically my position and more first though, it may be, I need substantiated as it will continue to be, is this, that we need radical change. Yes. And part of that does seem to be the dismantling of a capitalist state and a new system based on sharing. But when we even appear to have an allegiance to like, hey, like anything, an umbrella under which she had stolen is a more, and like, you know, me, I'd love a bit of Shea Guevara, but you can't, you've tried saying that in Miami people, the kickbacks pretty fierce in her life because like, because of the floors and because of, you know, like we've been, I grew up in the 80s and Cold War, which is, you know, see a, a town of two, two sides.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       I've, I find it very hard to unpick that. And anything that seems revivalist are nostalgic about communism, that's already happened. I think people were like, no thanks mate.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       You don't want to do that. I mean, I, I'm, I'm, I've been interested in some of these, uh, programs, for example, uh, in, in northern Syria, the Kurds have reorganized things along a kind of a assembly structures, uh, partly inspired by the, an alternative notion of democracy. I think that right now some of the progressive mass in Spain or trying to come up with a way of creating more democratic assembly structures. So I think there's a lot of experimentation that needs to be done on things like that. I think the big problem with communism was they had us and what I call a single bullet theory of social change, which was put in classic Marxist terms that the productive forces that is, if you could command production, then you'd really, the rest of society would take care of everything in a proper kind of way.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       I think we have to work on, on, on a whole range of different issues including sort of culture relation to nature. And we have to deal with a problem right now, which is fundamental to me, which is what I call global alienation. The alienation of populations politically from their jobs, from their daily life possibilities. And, and you've got alienated populations all over the world who then do crazy things sometimes, you know, that can be passive for a while and then something happens and you get these sort of seemingly irrational outbreaks of, uh, of craziness and they erect elect Donald Trump and do things like that. So I think alienation is one of the big, big issues. And when you have populations that are alienated then then you can't address it by sort of sign obote communist at that cause there was there as Eileen a pillar is I as alienated from political parties like the Communist parties and so on as they are from anything else.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       So it's hard then to rebuild some sort of a trust with Eileen knighted populations and that's a lot of political work to do. And I think there's an interesting distinction for me between uh, what might be called a social media is a form of communication and social media leading to forms of organization. The communicative forms are very good, the organizational forms are very bad right now and we've really got to think about how to, how to construct organizational forms. And I agree with you entirely. I'm not nostalgic about, you know, what the Communists did except that, you know, when it comes to healthcare and that kind of thing, I'd say, well we should look at how the Cubans did it and no one an education. We should look at the,

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       yes, I understand you're in now matched by the beauty of the original idea, the veracity of the critique and the possibility of components of it. Cause you said that great. It kind of was how many take that down, how it looks. That's what I'm interested is it will be recorded is open or causes. Okay. Thank you. I've seen endorsement that's going on the poster. You say to that, great, I'm going to give that in as a thing. As my phd, I'm not doing a phd. I'm doing the math on that begins with them. I'm really going to have to start listening in those lectures and that is yes that you like that and uh, I have a compliment. I'm so ego led. If someone's nice to me, it takes me about an hour to recover from my graces because I've been given a compliment that's just take a while to reflect on the compliment and the move on with the interview. And my point is, is that w let's say what's needed is something that whilst it may be derived from or capital or capital or booklet, I've only just learned to say correctly and now you've made can be, I'll do it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       I suppose David, the thing that sort of interests me, the reason I'm doing this podcast is I sense that change is possible. I sense that we are being lied to. I S I can feel I the, the, the argument that you made about alienation, it's so, it's so in evidence. Um, and I, I went to that Cuba when I was quite young, 22 and it was magnificent. I was there of all things to record a chewing gum commercial. It should the most vacuous product imaginable, not even nutrition, just the act of mastication as a ritual and an idea while people, staff. And while there, luckily I'm a drug addict because of that. It was then, I'm clean now. So that means that wherever I go, I have to go and find for people that know where the drugs are. So that means you'd have to get off the rails.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       You have to go down the rabbit hole. So I found myself in these things called Barrios in Havana. I liked it, I liked the people and I liked the murals. And there was a sense of Julie and glory and potentiality and caused from the 50s wine, not just streets painted by people in this presence of people and people's creativity. And as you say, the absence of that set alienation that comes when you don't participate in your city, when you don't participate in your culture, when you know you have no power, when you know you have no meaning, how lost you feel. I felt something different then, but I was on drugs. So you know, all of my experiences were being filtered through trucks, but I, you know, and that was before I knew that they had bloody good then. Okay, you know, live here and you know, all of that. But what I feel like when we are posing an idea to people now, I think what like w in there, what, what did Lenin, Trotsky, the Bolsheviks et Cetera, take from that book capital and use in the revolution in coal museum. And how did it become that, you know, like, uh, the, the failure that it became, even if you take as failure, either the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union, and what has happened in, in Russia now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       See that, that's a question I often get asked to my back away from. I kind of say, I kind of say, look, uh, yeah, Lennon and trust gay and Bacara and all these people. I read Capitol and I took certain things from him and I did certain things from him. Our job right now is to read capital and find out what we want to do with it. What shall we did? Yeah. Well, well, first off, you gotta learn how to read it, you know, and, and, and that is not initially an easy thing. And that's horrible. I hope some of those things I ride help people get into it. That's going to be vital. It, you're going to have to do that as really important. And, uh, you know, and I have these things on the web where you can do the, you can, there's a course on Marx's kapital volume one and volume two on the web, but you know, and you can take it on the web.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       Um, so, so yeah, open it up. But in the process, making sure that we understand what it is that, that, that miles is really teaching us about the nature of this system and know that it comes back to this is not what it appears to be on the surface to can we develop a way of critique? So I want, I want to educate people if I can, not necessarily to regurgitate knocks cause that's not the point, but to use his mode of an analysis so you can start to see, okay these populations that alienated, why are they alienated? Where's the alienation come from? Once it got to do with the nature of the Labor process, why is it labor process the way it is these days? Why did capitalist technology decide that they wanted a labor process which disempowered the Labor? Yeah. Why is, why is that there?

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       Why is it, as [inaudible] says, it's wonderful thing where he starts off one of these chapters and he kind of said, John, Stuart Mill has this problem. He says, look, we have all this labor saving machinery right now and you've ever thought this labor saving machinery but lighten the load of labor and John Single. But the funny thing is is it seems that it doesn't, the actually, it makes it a lot of the labor of worse and Marxists, but of course it does because the purpose of the machinery's not delight, lighten the load of labor is to extract more value and more surplus value, a more profit from the labor. Of course, if the machine can help you do that, and then that's what it does. So this is where there's, so this gives you an understanding of capitalist technology, which evaded Don's do at mill, but we smog sees very clearly and we see very clearly and say, actually the purpose of technology could change.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       There are all kinds of person, but it was military and all the rest of it in there. But one of the big purposes of it is to disempower the labor. Yes. And and when the Labor is disempowered, guess what? They become alienated. Yes. Guess what? They start behaving in an out of the united way. You know when you go at least things sort of going on, you're kind of saying, well these are the kinds of insights that come out of reading Marx's capital and you kind of go, wow, no. Once I've got that insight, I can't look at any discussion of technological change and imagine it's got some, some socialist utopia attached to it. As you know how some of the people who are writing these days do the artificial intelligence is the new socialist utopia now. Well you see what happens. Uber, Uber, Uber starts as a kind of sharing economy and the next thing you know it's become capitalized and somebody become a billionaire out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       You got high, you got the ability of the system. Is capitalism good morally, ethically it's, look, it's very big obstacle. Anything. You can take anything like I, I, my understanding of it is it primarily over the way that it interacts with culture and creativity and how you can see mimicked in its narrative. The, uh, central floor iee for example, take hip hop, which begins as sort of very defiant then goes through a stage of being Utopian and beautiful and then oh, becomes commodified, becomes clearly a product and to some degree about products and about commerce and about acquisition and about like he's, if the ideology is so endemic, it's so all encompassing that it becomes invisible. So you say that part of capitalism's DNA is it its own concealment, it's own consuming is a primary function. Once it's concealed, his self care can continue. Now what I think is, you know, when people talk about lean, you know, the system and the floors were the system who obviously when you say you know about technology's role is to technology, you know, John's mills all baffled by it for marks goes, no, no, no, it's doing its job perfectly.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       Or is that not true of bureaucracy and systems of control for someone? This system for some people, for some groups I'm institution, this system is brilliant, is working 100% effectively. We have all about climate change. No problem. Whereby alienation, inequality, riots, death, murder, that's the best summation. No problem. So who is this strata for whom this system is beneficial? Who are they? How do we influence, control, diminish, limit oppose them.

Speaker 2:          00:35:59       Phd. That's what you got to do. So she could have sold out. No, I mean I could give some preliminary salary answers to those questions. Write this down. Yeah. Well I'm in, it's an it's, I mean you're in a great position to take that sort of stuff on big time. Yeah. Because I mean it's very important when you're doing a phd to be in love with the no matter you're doing, you know, cause otherwise also brand myself by me, which is, which is fine because here's why you should be about in some ways. So I think it's a, but yeah. Who, who benefits while you can see who who, who extracts wealth from it and how wealth goods I guess. Yeah. How Jeff Bezos gets his money and now he is the guy rounds, Amazon, right and good though on my Amazon. But they're part of the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       I didn't pay the bloody tax a t bloody Begley controlling everything. So that would have to go and how Google, and I know elise, I love monopolies are kind of been set up so they'd been set up in such a way and, and, and, and actually, you know, I use use a minnow, definitely awesome at the same time, value is being extracted from us, kind of rent is being taken away from us. Uh, and, and, and so we've got these, these, these systems now which, which, which, you know, and, and I think particularly in the cultural field and so on, the, the forms of exploitation and appropriation are, are, are becoming and are pretty, uh, pretty, pretty chronic. I mean, there've been that way for quite a while, but it seems to me right now, particularly given the problems that I mentioned earlier, the capitalist running out of places to go for new things to do, just geographical a geographically, uh, and, and actually it's increasingly relying upon, you know, culture, the production and commodification of culture. What does that mean? What do you mean by that? Is the commodification of culture. For example, if, if, if we want to have a short turnover time or something, then, then the spectacle is instantaneously consumed. It's gone. It's not like my grandmother's knives and forks. It doesn't ask 150 years, this is the Olympic Games or something like that. But it becomes, becomes a big mode of capital accumulation. Vast amounts of money goes into rebuilding the infrastructure and doing all the things that the construction interest wants to do. And the Olympic Games or 10 days, it's all gone.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       And there was an x games that running track round out pink and, and, and, and, and, uh, how many, how many, uh, Biennale

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       is, are there now and every city has a bnr. Yeah, he's a patient with a cultural, you know like Venice exhibition or the Shanghai exhibition and the and and so and so you suddenly find though the whole kind of cultural realm is being used as a, as a sort of commodification real estate development kind of a scam. Yes. So okay, I see. It's like that there's a, a matrix of commodification. It's applied to everything and you can see it's prints, fingerprints, if it would have anything that's organic, his fingers on everything. Like football being a great example. How like, you know, if you listen to talk sport, which is obviously I think now owned by sort of sky and stuff, this is the sort of delicious, cruel irony of like what everyone is talking about all the time is I was just all goes about bloody money.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       So goes about money and like the way that sort of like the way that football looks now and of course in our players, amber, I mean that's one of the few ways that working class person as a chance to vent in any money is to become a world class football. So that's what I, that's not my point, but my point is that somehow the essence of the game is surviving. This process of commodification, how the experience is being turned into a product, how even age roots in community is tribal roots, its roots as a congregational activity, a spice for union. And togetherness is basically layer after layer of commerce wrapped around it. The players appearing in the adverse adverse on the shirts. You know, how long before the pitch has adverts on there, how long, you know, it's obvious say it's creeping through our consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       It's everywhere. And one of the things I think as well is I feel like you're growing up. When I did, I commodify people, I think I, I have to uncork I have to consciously unstitch my tendency to look at people and think, well, what are you going to do for me? What are you going to give me something? Can I have sex with you? I'm not thinking of this now, David. I'm trying to, I'm married now. Like I try not to look at people as commodities. That's one of the things, one of the floors, you know, you talk about on one hand, the alienation that people understand it. Oh No, I'm absolutely expendable. My role is meaningless. I am only a piece of this machinery and organic piece of matter in a machine. But the other side of that is that we start to look each other as commodities.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       That we could lose the diff, the lens of humanity. She said to me, you know, was a central kind of pull up politics. Uh, I'd like to see, tell you what I want to politics of decommodification. That is what's happened over the last 30, 40 years. Education has become more and more of a commodity, but should stop being a commodity. It should be a free good to everybody. Health care is a commodity. It should be a free good to everybody. In other words, we should start a de commodified whole sectors of the economy. Now that's this socialism. That's not communism, that socialism, that's a, that's a socialist or a project and you're right. We should also stop the, you know, start the commodifying others so that we start to look at others as people instead of instruments of our own, you know, uh, our own activities and trying to exploit fair economic ideology requires that it does things is sort of biological and psychological is stimulate limitless need and desire in order to perpetuate itself. Then here's also colonized the consciousness and the lives of the individuals beyond their economic role. Cause it requires their spiritual role be beholden

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       to be the ideology. No, no. I think the decolonization of the decommodification, those are the kinds of general food fields of endeavor which we can start to do things on right now. I don't do it well, you know, we couldn't even get the Labor party to start to go really strongly. I mean abolished student debt for example. There was talk of this. There's talk of it. Yeah. Well stop having talk about it. Don't do that, you know, do the same with uh, you know, making sure that there's enough money goes into healthcare. So it's really a non commodified set and we, you get rid of the secondary kind of privatized thing, which the get, get us out of the conservatives, you know, want to use that as a way of sort of chewing away at the National Health Service so that you're done. Uh, you know, so there's a, there, there, there, there, there are real politics, uh, that can have short, even in the short term, or you can imagine sort of a radical beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       And if people start to think in terms of decommodification just over something like education or health care, and then you can extend it a bit more to housing and then actually the basic, uh, food, uh, which, which, you know, the Cubans you did by the way. Oh yes. With a ration book on a ration book every year. Certain basic amount of rice and sign, and it's not working too well right now, but, but it was a basic food kind of allocation that everybody had. So do things like this and, and, and uh, we could do it, you

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       know, when people come out of a cult like scientology or you know, they have to sit him down with someone who goes to all that stuff you've been wired up with is not true when they come back to your mom and dad or whatever he is. And how are we gonna unstitch the conditioning generation generation deep. When I like sometimes just to make myself feel better, I really go and talk to the young people and like, you know, give him Ben there he is about my views. One of the things that's very difficult for me, uh, as someone now, you know, I'm in my forties now and I tried to feel like I'm a person that has access to the young and I feel like I can affect people is to recognize how light they are indoctrinated by they want, right. The phone don't tell them that they don't want the phone because they want it. You know, how much she learned. They said they think about money. Why would they not? How could they not, how do we begin to see this thing you said? The thing you like most of our marks, his analysis is these ferocity and its ability to deconstruct, critique and reveal essence, epiphany, that revelation of essence, the revelation of real truth, right. How are we going to wade through the layers of inculcation lacquers their mind? I you started at

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       various in various ways. I mean I think marks has asked answer to this is first off he says it should start to try to identify certain kinds of practices which are very simple practices over things like you know, using people who in instrumental ways instead of relating to them as human beings and that that these, these, these changes can, you know, so the realm of practices is very important and that can be all over the place. The second thing is to start to actually have a political movement which kind of says, you know, we don't have to actually create human beings of the sort that we're creating right now with a kind of neo liberal aesthetic and all of that. And, and we can do things rather differently and get people to read. I mean you mentioned Gandy, people sometimes read Gandy and get very transformed by it in terms of starting to think about the world in a different kind of way. And so there's an educational process which then gets embedded in a political movement. And I think that is then starts to be important. And uh, that political movement can start to have effects by orchestrating new forms of governance and democracy and the, like, for instance, if you look at what's going on in Barcelona, you've got a radical mare and she's trying to set up a kind of a new forms of democratic consultation within the city.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       Yes. She's only just started a, they only just started working on this, but this is one of the projects they have. So, but that, but that project comes out of a bunch of people who started to develop a small practices on the ground who got together and kind of said, look, we need to do something. We are radically different. I mean, the mayor comes out of the anti-foreclosure movement. She's, she very, very progressive. When she's got a bit of a progressive alliance behind her. And so new things can be be set up. And it's very interesting to me, and I'm interested in urban, this is not a radical males around the world. I mean even places like Seattle and Los Angeles have radical councils. Now we're starting to do things that are very different. The local level, just to the local level. And I, this is the way in which this political movement can't be taught from the top down.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       It's got, are all going to get sort of, it's got to develop organically somehow. I agree with the People's daily lives. So you're not thinking that that means to a degree then the power has to be closer to people and the yes. And then the essay, the idea of state power, even if apparently they never, lynn is always going to seem somehow abstract. Yes. And, and, and then you then, then, you know, to me it's more a dialectical kind of relationship between some sort of centralized state power. So somebody like who's a mayor of a city has a certain kind of centralized power, but I rest very much upon, you know, local neighborhood movements. Then what happens is I was movements try to do certain things and they get support. They need crucial support from an American do. So if you want to develop a new house in complex, which is a non commodity housing development of affordable housing and you probably need the city to help you acquire the land and, and if the city helps you acquire the land and the procedures doing this job. So said I relationship of certain kind between these different levels

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       of shame because you've gotten the most recent text messages from John Rogers cause he's talking about some people they're trying to buy some house. My mate John Rogers, he said First Communist, I've met when I was young man. He side fairly my head with thirdly dreams. Okay. Yeah. He sent me something recently about some campaign where people are trying to buy their own life by their own land and, and develop it. Do you think then that what you're saying, is it curious, do you think David, that they serve sort of forms of more localized or at least see wide government? For me, I would take with my particular code that that's an indication that we, what's required is decentralized, more decentralized power and perhaps this is the end of the nation state. I mean when you sort of look at what's happening in America and him, certain strands of British politics, like can you see pipe perhaps a within the brexit impulse, a sort of a, a certain positivity in that people want to unpick themselves. I know there's many reasons for brexit waiver on some level to a kind of decentralization power being closer to people, people having a degree of authority in their own lives. But I don't believe in a decentralized fashion as a, as an absolute. I mean because a, actually it turns out of the, one of the best ways you can orchestrate centralized control is through decentralization.

Speaker 3:          00:48:40       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       But you think about it at the market is a very decentralized system. And of course this guy, it's a, it's a, it's actually compatible with incredible concentrations of political and economic power. So, so I don't think decentralization in itself is the answer. I think that some level of decent in a situation where there's not any decentralization, we'd go for decentralization and then lies by its ideology. There is in the air has such a clear mandate. It's such a simplistic mandate, extract profit, extract, profit. Like you know, that that itself is right

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       geographical. It's be like, it can't be contained. You can't, you and I suppose any attempts to regulate, yeah, national level or local level are always resisted. Now another thing is say that for a moment when you said they're like the, if we had a political pie that wasn't login overtly committed to say, you know, sort of, uh, like, you know, some of the basics. Um, how do you think in governance in government such as a nation and it's such an ideology would survive one we'd like after weapon. Grace? Well, you know, again, that's one of the big issues. So you've got these pretty progressive movements when they get political power and then they find political power is constrained in certain ways, and the finances are such that they have to do things. So they'd become just like, you know, everybody else. And we've seen that, you know, the history of the Labour Party when they came into power, he started to be very much more pro capitalist. So, uh, so I, uh, I think, uh, at that point, the whole kind of revolutionary impulse has to be taken, uh, most, most seriously and decide a reformist party, uh, should look to create what I would call revolutionary reforms, those reforms, which opened the pathway towards

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       further, if you know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       what does reform, what would you prioritize the establishment of like benevolent state institutions around how often education, I can see how important that is, but is it not equally important given what we've discussed that to have powerful, draconian regulation of enterprise?

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       Yeah. No, I'm not in a, I'm not against a regulating what a, the capitalist class is doing a, I'm very much in favor. What does that sound like? Well it did, it sounds like, uh, for example, uh, you put strict rules on pollution and a, you put strict rules on things like occupational safety and health conditions in factories and the like so much regulation around their behavior and actually those, those

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       around pie as well.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       Well, I, I, I, yeah, I mean, I would like to see, uh, I mean, it wouldn't, what, what kind of world would it be if Ashley sign liker them on drag on a principle of which was we started out, well, it was a big cooperative that became bigger and bigger and bigger originated in Spain. And the rule was that the salary differential should be no more than one to three. Oh yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Now, recently it's gone to one to nine. So you see the kind of pressures on it, but one to three. Imagine if all corporations had to work under the, under the rule that the writer return to people in the corporation should a not be more than one to three right now. Big Corporation heads guess, I mean like 300 or 400 times what the average height down it. Yeah, of course running millions, but you legislate it and so kind of say, okay, here's the, here's the situation and we will be, we'll be living in a radically different world if we, if, if alcor if, if, if hey on right now is a scandalous, I mean you have this scandal going on here about how much the heads of a university is a paid oh, they're scandal.

Speaker 2:          00:52:29       Yeah. There any [inaudible] earning huge amounts. Yeah. May. And at the same time that cutting, cutting back on on, on a number of faculty, they hire you now because yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       It's very seductive isn't it? Yeah. Everyone gets loaded in. Yeah. Yeah. Become a, become a little dry in. It's very difficult not to get lured in. Yup. It's like you sort of like, you know, like I knew it was wrong prior to having money and I knew so that it wouldn't work as well. And then when you said the comfort, you see the seduction of comfort.

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       I confess I have some of that too.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       And that's why I thank you very much. That's why that is that there's a component to this. I always harp on about whether, and the only way to engender real change, deep change isn't not through, I don't think he's through analysis and critique because I think people sort of know. I think they know, but like uh, for to understand that change is possible. I think you have to make people feel differently. Yeah. And like, you know, they sort of the antithesis of the alienation that you just described.

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       Now there's a moment in any kind of revolutionary process with where, yeah, you're right. If people don't feel differently than

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       okay it's gone. Yes. So I wonder how, I mean do you mentioned as well there is the possibility for mass communication and there are some seats. So I was, one of the things I was trying to do when I like, and it was more overly involved in political conversation is I was trying to find grand stand flash, obvious, blatant, bland things that people thought, oh my God, you could do that. Like, and the one things you that group quarter ad busters. Okay. They would sort of say things like Cuellar Corporation and is there something about it made me sort of tingle with excitement is that they would say identify a corporation there is not popular dumb a campaign lips of almost like when we campaigning for hospitals or on behalf of unions it sort, it exists within a million that they know how to manage. Like I feel like a target campaign, there's like our role is we are going to crash, collapse, undermine dissemble apple was a difficult one because we've all got them and they're so bloody popular.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       We've all got them. We were all tacked up in it. Right. But like get it. Do you see like that there could be like the these ideas or is there any potential for that? I'd like to introduce these kinds of ideas are like in it cause it's hard for me to look at Google and Amazon with animosity or you know like even though I know why don't they pay their taxes? Why won't you know it? Because I like those logos, those brands and those stories that convenience, the comfort. It's so seductive. David, how do you like, you know, like people went, like when I talked to black cab drivers, you know, and like, and so I'm like, yeah buddy. Yeah. One of the few ways that working people can have an on his job and then like, you know, Uber, so creepingly convenient, right? What do we do? How do you ask people, you know, like how do you get people to change the way they see the world without some sort of different vehicle into their hearts? Well, you can

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       boycott is better or something like that. Uh, that would be an interesting way. In fact, they did get boycott in New York City. It was very interesting. Yeah. Uh, it was a day when a trump declared the no Muslims are allowed from those countries and they'll, everybody's rushing out to the Kennedy airport to sort of, you know, lawyers and all this kind of stuff for turning up there. And, uh, the regular cab drivers, uh, went on strike for an hour. So I actually arrived at Kennedy airport where, I mean, they, all this was happening. I was impossible to get out because like the cab drivers. But Uber broke the strike and Aruba came in the next day, uh, social media was of out of says boycott uber next day Uber lost half its passengers because, cause I, cause I undermined the cab drivers striker, uh, over the immigrant population. And I thought it was very interesting but that, that, that happened. So there is the, there are ways to go with it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       So the communities with their eyes illustrate

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       these points. I think sometimes these symbolic things are very important and that I am all in favor of, you know, any kind of symbolic action. I mean, I think the occupy movement was a symbolic movement and I think it, it actually changed the discourse about inequality, uh, introduced the concept of the 1% and everybody I was down at. And so we are, a lot of people were in the occupy movement and so it was a terrible, terrible failure. And he said, no, it wasn't a fire. I mean it did some things which were terribly important too soon to tell. They say, yeah, right. I May, I may I run through like a, the proper questions myself and make sure that we've covered everything because you're so fascinating. Well, no, I'm enjoying it too, so, yeah. Yeah. I love, we love Pricer Marx's capital. One of the most important text in the modern era changed the destiny of countries' politics.

Speaker 2:          00:57:12       People across the world. What are its key arguments? We better pick that up. I feel that we carry a pair, but you think we've covered that? Yeah, I think we all have and that there was about this, about commodification is about accumulation of capital, circulation of capital and how it has to grow and technological change and dynamism and all of that understood that. Do his ideas, the ideas if that's capital of capsule continue to resonate today and if so, what do they still offer? Well, I wish we talked about that too because we said, you know, capital is more prevalent around the world now and it was back then. So in some ways marks is more important now because the terrain on which it operates is much bigger. That socialism, Marxism, communism definitely done that. Considering the degree to which technological, economic and industrial changes occurred in the last hundred and 50 years, how might marks his analysis and its application need to be modified.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       You want to do it a little bit more of that? I think that the answer to it is not much. Uh, it's very accurate. It's a good, no, the thing is that Marx, yeah, Marx wrote a lot about what was going on in the 19th century and that's dated what he's writing about, what he's writing about capital is writing about a system which still exists, which is even more powerful now. It wasn't his day, so possibly we can now see how it's laid out. We got bloody, Oh, he said that was going to happen. Now there are some aspects, uh, the, the marks never got around to finishing doing on, for example, finance and the role of finance where he read that, he wrote some very fascinating stuff, but he never completed it. But we need to do that right now because the financial question is a much bigger question now than it was in his day.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Yes. Thank you. Your work is said to be appreciated by Anna Case and the outcome and the occupy movement as much as it is by Linden is party organizers. Why'd you think miss is? I have no idea and you should ask them. Yeah, that's right. Well done with not being vain. You should've put that question in their cow that makes us look sycophantic or cross that out. Right. I believe in the shadow. It makes us look how authentic. How has your anthropological and geographical background informed your teaching of marks? That's really good. Yeah. I want to know that it's actually, it's, it's a, I mean I, I have a, I call a different take on mark's taught our people and the is a m prime, not primarily interested in mark's. I'm primarily interested in urbanization, uneven geographical development at world scale, a local scale and things of that kind.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       And I, and I, the only thing I like about marks is it helps me understand all of that. Now when there's somebody in marks, it doesn't help me understand or that I kind of push it to one side and say kind of, I think this is probably a useless bit of marks. My religion, I'm very much about, I'm very much about mark's a as a, as a practical guide rather than as a grand theory Tisha and who's a pure theory got fest. And so I uh, I can't because you come from different disciplines in anthropology and geography are right now. And thank God I'm not an economist.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       Yeah. That stuff's boring isn't it? And it's a made up and it's not a science and he's all just pretend. Now what about, um, I like that breakfast thing that they say, where's your breakfast come from as good in it? Like, cause you said no, these beans. So it's probably been prevail and like that. A cold, no, it's all sorts has gone on. Put your fit mind the cocoa pop where to sugar come from? Yeah. Titan Lyle, that capital of Rab scallions. When trust as far as I could from, I still got the whip marks in their hands. So it's been, it's been said, we are entering a post capitalist era. Do we still live in the country side? How can I say one just after, of course we do. It's got worse than ever. Always something that's worse than capitalism. Maybe some sort of terrible, terrible behemoth. Some sidewalks. I'm horrible monsters. Always pretty horrible monster size, so it's, it's a monster that has some good effects. Sometimes beyonce, I don't know. Quickbase complying with beyonce. Will the current system ultimately proved to be fatal to us? I wish

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       could say yes, but the trouble is the capital can continue under the most dire conditions if people don't change it. And I thought, what's the point that people who have got to change it because I ain't going to change because I ain't going to change it. Resounded Gourd.

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       Right, and I have to change. What are some of the main contradictions at the heart cath is we really covered that with the growth and the dynamism. Garraffa car believed that they could go after the, he does all of these. The producer, he's been reading it very hard. Could you ever love me, Kara? Thought, where are you going? Really? What about the argument that says capitalism's contradictions lead to the innovations? They may do it resilient. That's good. Where'd you get that from?

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       Yeah. Well, you know, look, and there's a lot of reinvention going on at the capitalism and it's very useful. It's very useful. I mean, why would we do without velcro and things like that?

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       No crowd. I see an example. It's trivial things like that. But on the other hand, if you're struggling and you've got a broken arm and you need to fix it up and he'd wear Velcro, boy is it good? Ah, I said my stuff wanting to cut over giving. Given this entire interview, you write about how cities are both the heart of capitol and class struggles are cs. You rubber has cities of both capital. He write about how cities are the half both capital and class struggles. How am I cities be reorganized in Moss? Actually just an ecologically saying ways. One of

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       the big projects I think though we've got to have is how to redesign cities so that they're much more, uh, available to the population where they count the island nations, which currently exists to bound urban life. And actually it's interesting if you look at it over the last 30 years, most of the big movements gone around the world have been urban movements. And I gazey park about what happened in, in Brazil, uh, and, and uh, 2013, uh, you know, so, and even occupy was a much from a lot of it was about housing and urban questions and not about what's going on in the factory.

Speaker 1:          01:02:52       Hmm. That's interesting. I wonder what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       It means that actually the people are as concerned about the qualities of urban urban life as they are about the qualities of a, their employment. Yeah. They've always, they've always been involved in both, but one of the things that marks was a bit of bias towards is he biased towards production and not necessarily because the timing is right. Yeah. So, so I would always want to correct that. Have it in March

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       perhaps. Because now the kind of economies in which these movements were occurring, there is no longer sort of mass production in a manner in which there was men. Marx was writing now,

Speaker 2:          01:03:29       okay multiverse. And in many parts of the world, the working class in the sense of factory libraries, there's disappeared as being central. And if it's not in China or Bangladesh and so on, but uh, in North America traditional working class, it's been much diminished.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       Yeah. He separately say Paul Gilbert was, he pulled up, he said, ah, land yard of land, yard class, the needs of working class. Really interesting thing we had when we're doing interviews, sounds of dance capital capital's we now call it of course now that d and making that kicking, oh, curly curly have sought sensitive as an eight crash is Marxism on the rise.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       I think there's a much greater interest in it. And I think a, it, the [inaudible] idea was in the 1990s when it was very hard to get anybody to have a look at Alex's capital, but I think, uh, since 2000, it's, it's gradually come important. And then the crisis of 2007 2008 yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       Hey, some of these big arguments against communism in the 20th century has been directly responsible for killing 100 million people. Did it?

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       Yeah. This has a lot of things that can be very negative things, you know, religion in and of course mal made a huge mistake, which led to the great famine in China. About 20 million people died focus, you know? But, but on the other hand, it also saved a lot of lives. I mean, the interesting thing about even about the China case, when people get mad at me when I say this, yeah, okay, 20 million people probably died in the famine, which was unnecessary bad policies and all that stood on the other hand where mal came to power life expectancy in China was 35 and when he died and life expectancy was 65 so he did something right as well as,

Speaker 1:          01:05:12       yes, I see. You feel like it's your personal role to address much of the propagandized information was taken as

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       another photo of the public eye on it. It emphasizes all the negatives and it never says anything about what the positives were. Balanced propaganda. On the other hand,

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       I understand one capitalist economies are based on free exchange. This is a popular claim of capitalism. Is that true? Is it made up?

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       Well in principle it is, but in practice a lot of it is monopoly, power,

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       monopoly, power plus even people's and the role of the consumer and they've been stimulated into a terrible state of desperation. Um, I think we've covered it. I think this is such a thorough interview I've done now. It kinda just before, I mean not, not that we let you go, your continued to be free, but my mate John Rogers sent me this thing, check out this and see if it makes sense. Uh, like a blah blah blah. I meet out in Malin you in respect of this project we are hoping you could speak to Russel about here. I'm Russell and probably close to his heart. This is a number of people in Harringay have formed a company with the aim of buying a large bit of land that would otherwise be sold to a private developer. They will want to build loads of expensive housing and a part of Harringay Tottenham, I mean just as call it north London, it's not antagonize.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       Most of the other people in London where I'm just a big football insights were local people can't afford them lost gentrifying the area and kicking out local people. What we want to do is build 800 times. They're all genuinely affordable for local people and the site controlled by local people or low, I could go on, he says, but if you need more info you can go to the websites, start hiring guide or Co. Dot. UK. We are actually serious about this as a funny paragraph to put this late in. Uh, we've got, we've got solicitors, architects, we've been speaking to the mayor about blah blah blah blah. We need to pry pile on pressure and publicity. So what do you think about project like that where essentially I suppose their project is to have sort of a, to acquire some land to build 800 times and sort of govern them. So again, he's going to be operating within like a metropolis that's got other systems of government aid his heart.

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       Um, uh, you know, I'd love to know more details. Like you don't just make snap judgments like a [inaudible] support, this kind of thing. I mean, in the states we have something called community land trust, which takes, which means that people who are in those houses can't sell them. So I don't know whether that's in that proposal where the people are the easier, they can't turn a quick profit on their host. So, so, uh, you know, if, if people come in and they live there, then if I leave, then they just get back what they put in and I, there's no kind of speculation on the land. So anything of that sort. I'm in five fiverr off. Yeah, people were, but people have authority and power in their own lives and the ability to govern themselves with possible. But if they, but we sometimes find in those things where people look at the situation and say, well, under the rules of the game, I can't sell and, but if I could sell, I could make mega bucks. So therefore individuals tried to then turn those collective things into things where they can speculate and come out. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       isn't it cause in a way capitalism, like most and observable phenomena as somehow sourced from the, our inner lives of fear, greed.

Speaker 2:          01:08:21       Well, it's partly that, but then, you know, if, if somebody is living there and I see that if they could make this better, turn this back into a market proposition, they could make a lot of money out of it, then, you know, and they got pressing needs, you know, medical needs or something like that or well then, then, uh, they want to go market.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       Yes, yes, yes. I see. So

Speaker 2:          01:08:42       greed and, and, and, and an ideology and so on. People have real kind of needs.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       I suppose that's why you, uh, I insistent on there being some kind of state roles so that there is some sort of overarching principle. So legal apparatus there that prevents them selling out at a market rate. That's some free advice from David Harvey that you've got there from you. And you know, there are some called Tony [inaudible] who's a friend of my mate, John Rogers. And finally what five books we've got to read. It's a terrible, terrible, terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       Um, but yeah, you should get an reading this stuff from any, all kinds of different perspectives. Uh, and, and the sorts of things I would so say is, uh, you know, if you read a clr james on a black Jacobins, uh, you know this, I mean this is a common understanding. It's an understanding of marks. It comes from, from the colonial experience, put it that way. And so anybody is coming from that background I think would immediately get sucked into sort of appreciating the marks is standpoint from that experience. I say the same thing about something Sunday like Silvia Federici who has a book on Kaliban and the witch and, and another more recent one called 0.0, which is about the experience of women and the whole history of capital accumulation from the very origins to two today. Again, you know, people who will get into that and I would get a person and perspective on the marks, his position, which would come from, from that.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       And then I, you know, for a, a humanist position, I'd say read Terry Eagleton spoke on, uh, why Marx was right. Uh, wear marks where he actually goes over the whole history of, uh, of, of, of Marxists humanists positions that he took on, why he was right and corrects a lot of the bad propaganda that we've talked about. And then I leave for it. And then I, then I'd say, then I'd say, actually, I'm going to give you a couple of mine. I think you should. You should take a this last one, which is uh, uh, yeah, Marx capital and the madness of economic reason, eh, but then I will it by reading the brief history of neoliberalism, which is about the history of capital accumulation from an 1970s onwards, but it got out to about 2005 so it was before the crisis, whereas the new book has a final chapter which updates the neo liberalism.

Speaker 2:          01:11:09       Bocomez happens in neoliberalism since 2005 so I would say, you know, you would get into get into things that wise expedition of learning. I'm going to start with yours professor. Thank you so much for coming on the air for having me. This has been great. We did you say I've been great. Always been great. All right, brilliant. Thanks. Hey, we, why don't we go on? You read in this monologue from Shakespeare that you've concluded that's right out of King John. How come you saw king John saw King John? Because a friend of mine took me there to listen to it and it's not a great place. You're on the other hand, there's this great speech in the middle of it. It goes like this mad world, mad king's mad composition, that's smooth face gentlemen tickling commodity commodity, the bias of the world, the world who have itself is pasted well made to run even upon even ground to illicit vantage.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       This vile drawing by us, this sway of motion, this commodity makes it take heed from all in different see from all direction, purpose, course intent and this same bias, this commodity, this board, this broker, this all changing word and why re ally on this commodity but for, because he has not wooed me yet. Now that I have the power to catch my hand when his for angels was sort of my palm but for my hand is an attempted yet like a poor beggar ray Ellis on the rich. Well wiles, I'm a beggar. I will rail and say here is no sin but to be rich and being enriched. My virtue then shall be to say there is no vice but beggary since king's break, faith upon commodity gain be my Lord for idol worship Thee. Yes, it's a great quote. And of course, the first line of Marx's Kapital is, I'll look to me for that. You're the first line is that the wealth of the world in which we're looking at here appears and have greater accumulation of commodities. Ri Shakespeare, Karl Marx, professor David Harvey, thank you very much for joining us on under the skin has been a great component in a wonderful education for me to chase. Thanks mate.
