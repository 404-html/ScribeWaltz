Speaker 1:          00:00          I not think this individualistic culture is in itself. Destroying the principles are spiritual human level of community. Do you not think that economic inequality creates in a human being a sense of injustice, of unfairness? Because people. Do you know what Kandis the 90 percent of people that are rich? Do you know why they're rich? They was born rich because I to tell you something, I think that economic disparity creates that feeling, but at a fundamental understanding of economics can tell you that most people that are rich are born rich. It's not like there's a tiny minority of people that are like you that come from a poor background and managed to overcome it, and this is what a pro I problem. I've noticed we have a lot of great people is they sort of belief that their greatness is something that can be replicated and I don't think it it can.

Speaker 1:          00:43          I see. So I believe in the individual you don't. That's for differences, but the primary goal of the individual should be to serve the community. I, I do not believe that the primary goal of what the individual fields. So you're, you're just, you're discounting the human spirit. He was counting. Now there is. Let me ask you a quick no, there's not in a humanity. Think of animals in the wild. Even have to go to humanity. We can just think about animals in the wild. What is our human instinct? Okay? Are you going to make sure that everyone on this block is fed? Before you feed yourself? Do you go around and say, Hey, have you had breakfast this morning at breakfast this morning? Hey, how are you going to make sure you're eating? If you have any of you have an excess, of course you're going to do the humans.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Human condition in our incentives are going to be one of the richest. The 15 people on the planet have got as much cumulative. Well first, the poorest 5 billion, but your neck. So no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, okay. Excuse me. First and foremost, you're talking about literally point two, zero, zero, zero, zero. One percent of the world is what he's talking about and what are they preaching? What do they want socialism so that nobody else has the opportunity to become what they've become. They are the ones that are pushing it. Are you kidding? George Soros doesn't want socialist policies. Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, doesn't want socialist policies. They want to make sure that no one else has the opportunity to get.
