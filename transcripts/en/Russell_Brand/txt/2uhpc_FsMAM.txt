Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ruby wax is a content writer and performer who has lately become known as a campaigner on mental health issues and a champion of mindfulness born in Illinois, the only child of refugees. Ruby studied psychology at Berkeley. They say it right. Barkley, Barkley, Barkley, and moved to Britain in 1977 where she wrote for shows such as not the 9:00 news, girls on pop with doing French and Saunders. Saunders and Tracy Omen. In 2012, she completed a master's degree in mindfulness based cognitive therapy, Oxford, and in 2014 was appointed an ob for services to mental health. Imagine that her recent books include the number one best seller, saying new world taming the mind and a mindfulness guide for the frazzled. Her new book, how to be human. The manual is released in January. She's been married since [inaudible] 98 88 to her third husband and has three children. Thanks for coming. I could have just listened to you all day thinking I'd like to meet that one. She sounds like a terrific human being. Have much cute. So Ruby, how. What is it that made you transition from an entertainment based life to one, based on the psychology, the spirit therapy, whatever this is that you're doing now? What's, what inspired you?

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       Well, I uh, I went to Berkeley when I was young. That's how you say it, but Berkeley and I never finished because I hitchhike through Europe. I decided what were you doing in the first place? I was doing psychology but I never finished and I just ended up hitchhiking one day and I have nightmares to this day what my locker combination is because I left all my books there. So to this day I'm still racking my brains there. I am the illusion, they're still there. So I wanted to come to Europe to get away from my parents a and B. I wanted, this is pathetic. A classical actress with no talent. None, Zilch. I mean since high school, that was like 6,000 people in my school. I was the only one, not in the show. 6,000 were in Hello Dolly. I settled. I mean I was in production.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       It was a full load. Him staring at 5,999 people in Hello Dolly. Anyway, fuck them all. Can you say that? My whole life has been, you know, where are they now? And I've tracked them. Vengeance against Berkeley. No, against every township high school. Then I went to Berkeley to study psychology and then I thought I'm going to come to England and become a classical actress if you knew how delusional that was. So I used to watch. Goes on top. I liked it. You were one that was much later. I really. Yeah. Yeah. Know Evanston was when I was 17. Then Berkeley was 18, 19 mangoes on top girls on top of way later. Way like a century. Know about. Um, I was 17 girls on top. I was. No, I was 30. Yeah. That was kind of a gap. So you knew when you went in

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       early life in academia that you were interested in psychology then it seems like you pursuit some external glamorous goal and then in Middle East Age,

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       isn't it? You're divided between a food for the brain, which isn't really on your agenda when you're 20 and yet a narcissism was always nagging away. I mean, now that I know how my father got out of Europe, I understand why I have this insatiable thirst for things that are impossible, you know, because they said he'll never get out. And now I have this drive to get things that people say it's impossible, but I had no English accent. I had no talent. That's a tough one. So I went to Europe. I just hitchhiked. I sort of sold some marijuana to get the plane ticket. Can I say that?

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Yes. None of these will be handed to the authorities. Ruby Berkeley.

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       So they had. Anyway, I sold that and some girl scout cookies. Got to Europe. I found myself an acting teacher. Finally, it's a longer story. Um, I hitchhiked with somebody from the cast of hair. This is sort of sad because that was my first taste of Bohemia anarchism and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       about what you feel that it is somewhat telling that it was a prepackaged and stage version of Bohemia that you are Lloyd yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Well, I was, yeah, I stopped him. So then, um, I went with this guy through Europe and ended up in Israel where I found somebody to teach me acting. Then I came back to London, lived in a bedsit for two years in audition for probably rod is seven times and was rejected each time because it was, they said one of the most grotesque auditions they'd ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       She Hunt. I ferocious drive for success and for attention I read, I'm saying new world. It was a bit in there where you talked about being in like a like, you know, so we know we're famed, sort of can lead to either it's a continued upward trajectory or it can become sort of grimly cataclysmic. And your anecdote about that shark tank show that you, a participant in saying that you know, that there was a sort of an attractive woman who was in bikinis, was the central focus of celebrity shark tank or whatever. It was a shock celebrity shark bait shop that marked the end of my career. So I like to pick that scab liked it a lot. Yeah, I'm not. So it was always when it was already, like Korea was

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       really fading away, you know, there's signs because you ride on that surf and people give you attention and you get, you know, the fantastic infantilizes you this kind of career, you know, that's why you can't get, you know, it's so hard to wean off the mother breast of fame. And so, um, then the car, you know, I started getting desperate and they take the nipple away and said, oh, I'll do anything. Please document my gallbladder operation. So they said, here's something even worse, getting a shark tank with Richard and grant and we'll film right? And it marks the end of my career is peculiar, actually receive enriched. He grown up, I would say very, very talented, bright, brilliant people, but the machinery of celebrity will ultimately deposit you in a shark tank. So what was it off of them? The obvious that was particularly revealing about that. What, what was the nature of that revelation of knowing that we were, it's over, this is it, it's over.

Speaker 2:          00:06:27       But in the first few years of being ejected from the central, the central spotlight is you think, oh well this is just temporary. Surely they'll have me back. But there's telltale signs, like when I was asked to cut the ribbon at Costco's for the Qa, Costa coffee at terminal three, that's another sign that things aren't going well. So Richard and I were joking saying how awful this show was and really would end our careers. And then it did. It did kind of end around then and they had a really beautiful babe from holyoke's, you know, who was asked to take her top off to practice getting into a shark tank. So they'd say to Richard and I, you aren't needed it. Most days we weren't needed. So Richard and I both bought houses in Cape Town, which I still have because we were so bored in. The rand was really bad.

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       So you could buy one for about 10 bucks. So Richard and I went with a camera following us because they always liked to pretend, Ooh, this is reality. We both bought houses and on day 75, the babe with the breasts had refused to get in with the sharks. They had been everyday training or right making or stand in a frozen freezer to check that she could take the cold with no top on imagine. And she'd say, do you think I'm being exploded to us? We go, no. A. Anyway, the last day she refused to get into. They said, get the old ones in here. Richard and I are now crammed into these rubber things. I'm actually, um, I've actually got cystitis. I don't know if you could say that, but that's not a good thing to go into shark tank with. So they drop us in and we're not in a tank and not in a cage like they usually do for special occasion.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       They put us in a tube, a see through tube, which means you're in the aquarium and the sharks watching and he's magnified. So he comes at us. I pissed myself. So that urine came out of my collar and then Richard and I started laughing beyond and they dubbed in screams. So it ends with, it looks like Richard and I are sitting in the bottom of a test tube and I always say I'm the sharks just swam by looking for a list celebrity. Anyway, that was pretty bloody brilliant actually. I know it does sound good now, but they cut a lot out. So it was just basically tits, tits, tits, Richmond and I screaming and some urine coming in and coming out of her neck because credible image. But like, so obviously though all she told the story in a very humorous way, it's painful. Agonizing.

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       So what happened to you mentally and spiritually that made you want to stop? Well, you know, I had a lot more life before and nothing sadder than an old celebrity. Nothing, you know, it used to be Panto was the pits. Now it's one of those reality shows where you eat a cockroach. So I thought this ain't happening, you know, and people saying, weren't you? And I go, was I who, you know, it was never me. Anyway. So I thought jumped now jumped before the party. The party's over, you know, before, you know, before you're not invited anymore. So I, I jumped right out and went to school to get a degree in psychotherapy, which was. People let you know, drop me and laughed and said, oh, it's psychotherapist, but I just needed something. I knew I wasn't going to be a psychotherapist, but you got me a new group of friends.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       I had to wean myself like coming off of drugs off, you know, getting on the tube and nobody going, oh fuck, I know who you are now. I go, do you know who I am? And they go, fuck no, buy a ticket. Like everybody else, you know, that one. The arrogance had to be squeezed out like sweat. And then eventually I had my new friends, I went, I studied, you know, young, and then I'd study winnicott and then I'd studied bowlby and I got really, you know, I thought this is great. Tell me about, did it feel like you were picking up something that you would describe? Brain started getting a honed again, you know, it started to come to life and then, um, and then I had to, then I had a serious breakdown in my third year. That's when everything crumbled. And I think it like before you invent, reinvent yourself, there has to be a death.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       I always think of the Phoenix, you know, before he rises, it was death, you know, that everything shuts down all your, everything that was your reality is taken away. There's just nothing. And then some of us, and I always love this expression, this is where you either turned into wine or vinegar, which coincidentally young did say. So I started to, um, I've, it was in that institution a long time. Will Your institution. Yeah. And it was so bad that I. Oh, this is tragic. At one point the BBC threw me another bone and I did a show for a. It was a BBC Internet, right? Not like it is now. Sex seems like a show called Ruby's room or something that three people would hear. It was about mental illness. So, uh, every week, uh, three per a person would come to my house that was the idea with a different pathology, so I'd have schizophrenia or, um, physical dysmorphia or bipolar, and then I take them in a way to have tea and they'd sit with my cat and my kids would come in and then I, because I knew how to interview them because they're my people.

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       Then at the very end it would say, here's the symptoms and here's what you can do about it. Which I thought was really responsible and the show was sometimes hilarious by this time I was, I couldn't get on tv, but that was a great show even if you caught me out. So again, I don't want to get better because it was a blessing that I got kicked out now. Um, and they'd come over every week and this is how bad it was when I first got the job, my first guest was a depressive and I had 10 shows to go. So I was in the institution. Ed had to get me pick me up from the pick me up from the institution. I've I put lipstick on. Everybody in the institution applauded and said that was so brave. Imagine you know that's from the cream of the crop.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       I went home. I'm sitting with a depressive and I'm from an institution dripping, dripping in sweat and trying to pretend you were who you used to be and the depressed person is looking at me going, man, you are more fucked than I am. Of course nobody can see when you're mentally ill. So I did this shaking slightly, but they think, oh, she's being funny. Finished the interview and then was taken back to the institution. So my first show clinically. What type of mental illness were you suffering from an the Sam? I will always have its clinical depression, depression. I don't get up. It's vanilla depression. It's not the up and down. So that was a long time in there and I tried to. I had regions. They said you have to leave because you're not finishing. So everything was taken and then gradually when I came out and that was a bad time, you know, I'd sit for weeks on end in a chair.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       Did you ever get this where you'd look at the shower and think, oh man, I had some day. I hope I can get into that again because it's not feasible that you could ever take a shower. It's, it's, it's too confusing. So the nurse would come and hold my hand and then she finally take me to the shower after a month and then eventually she got me to the door and then eventually she took me to the park and so I was saved. So you were experiencing the, the despair and that despair fools like her sort of an absence of any. Anything, live force, any energy. What have you learned about psychology or neurology? These helpful to you in understanding your own personal experience with regard to it's an extremist? Yeah. Well, to study the brain is such a relief to understand the pathology of it because then you think it's not my imagination because in everybody looks is feeling that they're making it up. Come on, Mike. Ruby. Uh, everybody thinks they're making it up. I mean that, that's that. So the disease isn't necessarily depression. It's shame. That's what we all suffer from it. It's like saying to somebody with Alzheimer's, Oh, come on, you remember where the try harder.

Speaker 3:          00:14:32       Just think, okay, where is it now I've taken it again. I swallowed it. Go. That is cruel. So let's say to understand it, you're neurologically. Same thing as let's, it's a brain. I find it even

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       as a person that sort of personally knows about mental illness and knows a lot of people, I still sort of defined mental illness, annoying because the name. Because your brain is an organ. Do you know what I mean? If you flipped yourself upside down, would you call your feet mental illness? It's a. do you know what I'm saying? Oh, you look physically well. What the fuck does it mean?

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       Mental, mental is physical. It's an, it's an Oregon. It's the only one that when it breaks down, you don't get any sympathy cards and yet it runs everything. So the ignorance of the world is astonishing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       Why do you imagine or what do you think that is?

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       Um, there's always been a stigma, so I'm, you know, there's always been women at 55 lose their jobs. I'm not naive, you know, I, I'm not one that goes, it's not fair. It was always a taboo, you know, because people may think they are by the grace of God, go, I, you know, it's only a hundred years ago. I think we were burned at the stake, so it, but it will leave, you know, the gay movement suddenly now homosexuals are everywhere in a minute. The whole gay thing will change again. It'll be, that'll be the last taboo. But where we are now is still in an era of shame

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       and I'm not, you know, I'm not too, it's not fair. That's the way it is. If you were to examine the template of a bigotry against a sort of an inverted comments, minority social groups such as homosexuals, it's because of the sort of, the costing of the dominant class is shadow into those groups. You sort of talking about James Baldwins analysis of the category of Negro is because it bears the shadow of the white dominant class, so if it is in terms of attempting to follow the, that idea that it's a maligned and outcast group and it's not something that's essential. Because when I think about mental illness, I think, well perhaps it's because if perception itself is warped, you can't. There's nothing that you can trust. There's nothing tangible there. And when a human being looks the same as they always look, but they're behaving differently. I find it very, very. I find it frightening when other people are in the exhibit in mental illness. Um, but from a sort of from a just because it's not tangible. And yet, you know, my professor said,

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       I'm not bitching again, had a bill gates put the money into mental health instead of malaria. We would know what it is. You would be able to define depression just the way you can down to find cancer. And that's only because it had a lot of money thrown at it. Not because it's some mystical, you know, it's serial disease. It's just that nobody threw the money in. It's as simple as that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       So you think no matter how seemingly a theorial something might be, it is on some level mechanical on like whether it's consciousness, so consciousness a, d, a, d, O w. we're going to continue. I'm going to bash us 15 minutes every 15 minutes. Careful what I said about consciousness. So the mechanics consciousness.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       There's a whole nother ballpark, but disease, you know, the way we can look and see how cancer is formed. Sure it wasn't possible, you know, a thousand years ago. Now it is. Everything is. It's a disease that's mechanical. Consciousness is a whole different ball. Park consciousness, the relationship between consciousness and presumably the brain is integral a, the capacity to understand the brain can understand disease. It's a, you know, it's a technical glitch, but it can that the consciousnesses, what the hell is that we just don't know, but like, but is there, but given the perspective and consciousness are possibly synonymous. Then the understanding of mental illness and consciousness are, I think integrated, but that there is a relationship between mental illness and the nature of a person's consciousness because it's your consciousness that is becoming warped, isn't it? At least that's what's manifestly happening, but we don't know what consciousness is.

Speaker 3:          00:18:52       Louis Wolpert says, I'm sadnesses to depression where the tumor is to cancer. Meaning that's. God said. It is something. There's something physiologically not. It's not. It's a tumor. That's what it is. Consciousness is a much bigger ballpark. It, um, I know what you mean is that if you have a malignancy in your, in your brain, abby, it's gonna Affect your thinking. But you know, there are people, if you know, I love the man who thought his wife was a hat. You know, all those extreme things that I think I even put in my book, people who assumed that their arms are real, you know, are, are the, are their enemy. And so what's that illness? I have it written down. They chopped their limbs off other people, you know, see their mother and they see it that she's a stranger or they see their left hand and it looks like it's trying to kill them.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       Those are brain diseases. They can easily be marked as to what's missing. What's their consciousness is a, of course it, it, it, it, um, it inflicts itself on how the person thinks, of course, but they're still conscious. They still, the moment they wake up in the morning, however, you know, the way we express ourselves as a teeny, teeny grain of sand on a, you know, an iceberg, the size of Mars. So how you think and how you talk has nothing to do with, you know, it's a teeny bit of consciousness because consciousness is everything. You know, it's your heart rushing through its proteins being made. It's, we don't even know, you know, get, get somebody who's in physics in here and I'm, I'm at his feet with the relationship between wellness, mental wellness and mindfulness that you've been exploring really in all three of these books. It seems to me that it's using tools that have been available for a long, long time, Millenia primarily through a theological means and

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       the, the, these are predicated mostly on the idea of cleansing the consciousness, having a relationship with an aspect of yourself that's not mechanical, that is not the body is not the brain. So what, given that your latest book is a monk and a neuroscientist and you exploring mindfulness, exploring wellbeing, exploring being a human being.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       Yeah, it's not. The monk is obviously from the mindful school, did neuro scientist is very much, um, how, how, what addiction is, how the future works with how evolution, you know, affected us, that, you know, how we actually do evolve, um, how, how relationships are formed. He comes from the very mechanical side and the other one is the mind and most of them are married. They completely agree on every front. So that's to me really reassuring. Also, they're funny. They have a good sense of humor. Um, but to take mindfulness, mindfulness was made simple, simple simply for the west by Jon Kabat Zinn who was dealing with people in pain. It wasn't for any mystical experience and then my professor, Mark Williams started to use mindfulness for psychological reasons for people with depression, so they're using some ancient wisdom as young did to everybody borrows and they put it all in using MRI scanning, which is only, I don't know, it's not that old and they obviously did a lot of research and it was mindfulness.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       It had the best results. It wasn't like somebody showed up with a Bindi and decided, I'm going to push this one because you know there's a market in it. They literally did experiments on the works and cognitive and mindfulness had the best results, but that doesn't mean for everybody. I mean, know what's good for me is going to kill you. Do you know what I mean? They say jogging is good. Well, the guy got, the guy dropped dead. Who'd invented it? So we. Part of mindfulness is understanding where's your tipping point, how much you know, how much is good for you, and when does it tip into sickness? When is it a habit? When does it go into addiction? When am I working in my flow and when have I tip and now I'm going to burn out my immune system. That's what mindfulness is good for, is that you can check your internal temperature. I can't get into the Buddhist stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       Tell us what mindfulness in your understanding of it and how you practice it means just for people listening to this. Well, I don't do the woo woo stuff. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       that that was not my, what was appealing. Uh, I could give you the scientific reason which really turns me on how to do it, how to do it is. But I like what happens in your brain when you do do it, because if I explained to sit up and said, will you lie down? And then you get up and then you lie down and you get up. I've got to show you my six pack for you to actually go, oh, I get it. So if I say, this is what you do, you sit down. I have to explain what the effects are in your brain. So when you sit and you have a focus, when you take your mind to focus, let me just say, should I do my spiel? Usually we're in a high state anxiety. That's the culture we've created. You know, 50 years ago it wasn't so bad.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Now distraction is our middle name, so that means there's a part of our brain that's primitive called the Amygdala and its aroused when we feel threatened and that's what the court is all out. Okay? We used it with dinosaurs or whoever the enemy was. As soon as the incident was over, we got calm again. Okay? The problem is it never shuts down and that's why were so many people are burning out. Kids are cutting. That's the situation is that we're flowing cortisol the whole time. That's all it is. And it leads to every problem. We have physical ones too, so stop thinking mental. Too Much Cortisol Burns causes cancer, diabetes to infertility, obesity, all the problems are because of the cortisol. But if you start to focus on one of your senses because of the cortisol or you could send me, those are the conditions that create causal, like the cortisone is a, what's happening everyone one level, but like also what really needs to change the conditions of created conditions that creative, but because we aren't really thinking, you know, not any more, we're more at the mercy of technology.

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       Yeah. Nobody's, everyone's going, oh, let's shut technology down. What we put it there. That is our evolution. You know, we used to um, evolve to adapt to climate. Now we adapt to culture. It is our culture, but we don't have the genetic variants to deal with it. So now they're having to bring in things like mindfulness and they'll be in a few years, there'll be mental fitbit's a bet you to be able to test your own cortisol because left to our own devices in this world, addictions out the window, you know, I mean at its height, obesity, the whole thing. I mean, we know what the situation is, but the result is you. Gosh, Cortisol. So the thing with mindfulness, when you focus on a sentence, just go with me on this. The immediately there are, you're not thinking anymore, you're focused on a sense. So the Amygdala goes deactivates and this other part called the insula.

Speaker 2:          00:25:40       I'm making it simple. Activates, okay? Each time you do an exercise where you watch your mind gambling, then you focus on a sense it deactivates the other one activates and the more you do it, just like a sit up that insulin gets buffed like a muscle so that when the shit hits the fan and you get really stressed, it's easier to pull to a focus because you've got, you know, you've done the workout. And then that, that, those voices going, this is shit, I'm an asshole. Why am I depressed? Nobody else's depressed. It's quieter. What sense do you use? I usually follow my breathing and the thing is it's portable, so I don't have to sit on a gluten free cushion if I'm on the taxi here. Um, you know, rather than see, they've actually said that obviously they do scans on people mind wandering.

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       It turns out that mind wandering makes us really miserable and also you're, you're, you're missing three, four year life. You can't, you can't. And ordinarily a out of five thoughts for a negative. That's just human. Our proclivity as humans, and again, it was for good reason because if we didn't think negatively, we would have been eating, so we always have to be on our toes. Anyway. The thing with mindfulness is virtually you, you get this, it's a lion and not a Bush better not to sing a Disney too, because chances are you wouldn't be here in the evolution stakes these days. Yeah. How does. I can see how that works. Anyway, I'm jumping around, but the point is, is that I met. I can lose my temper like anybody and rage is still my drug of choice, but the, I can get the cortisol down quicker so it doesn't give me the heart attack.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       How does it work in practice? Then thought I'll get up in the morning and to me it's a new habit like brushing my teeth. I tried to do it at home, but all I do is track my breathing. That doesn't mean there's no thoughts. People get this wrong. The only time there's no thoughts is when you're dead. That's it. So you watch the shit coming through. You know, the, you're an idiot every but oh God, I got and Russell brand. He's such a genius. I'm such a moron. Why did I even do this? I didn't write this show. Oh my God, I'm bluffing. Everybody's going to get, you know, the usual. Oh, don't forget to get a toaster. The toaster. It has to got to be fixed and you need more tips. Don't corn, Russell. Show get some cue tips was why wasn't I a ballerina?

Speaker 2:          00:27:56       What did my mother, okay, this could go on forever. So they're going, but because I'm used to watching them, you know what I'm used to watching. They're more like a radio in another room. I sort of expect them and go, oh yeah, that's tracked number 42 there. Strack number 77. Of course you admire Russell. That doesn't mean you're an idiot. Just let it go. Let it go through. Yeah, but you are still a little bit of an idiot and he's looking at you like you're. You know what I mean? All that. So I sort of. The minute you can watch your thoughts, you're not a slave to them and some will be true. Maybe you don't like me, but the point is I didn't waste my energy thinking about it. If you're an asshole, then I'm an asshole. Do you know what I mean? Whereas before, and this is where the cognitive thinking comes in, you get caught in a habit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       I really thought I was the stooge that everybody thought I was an idiot and I can blame it on my parents. You can blame it on whatever you want to go on and on about it. Life is short, so instead of that, when I get my normal records, I can kind of. If you go to a, if the minute you go to a sense thinking lowers your listen, you listen, or you could, you could, you could focus on some things. You could use any sensory information. You could use me re-designated attention Arab's used those beads. You know, if you, if you focus on the sense of the beats, it's a very smart thing. If you're, that means that there's part of your body that's not involved in the thinking. It's, you know, so of course the thinking comes through, but you're, you're, you're laying back a little bit. So you're going, oh, I see what I'm thinking. It's not necessarily true. Now let's rethink. Maybe Russell actually likes you. Let's just break the habit. He adores me. Now what interests me is how many of these men in this particular technique, mindfulness east, found in

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       theology now like I'm sort of aware like anybody, that there is much in a religion in scripture that is sort of of its time and is used to underwrite bigotry, power and establishment. But why? Why, when I become fascinated is when in theology there are techniques that are effective in helping us to moderate control our consciousness and improve our lives, which they cannot possibly have had access to the which in their case can't have been underwritten by the technology that is currently being examined with. So I think, how do they know in the vader's that this is going to work? How do they know? I don't know. It's fascinating though, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       I know they knew that they knew, but they were uh, you know, somebody went bingo. But the thing is they've also put nuns in a scanner and the very fact that they pray also lowers the Amygdala. Amazing. So I'm really 30 minutes. There are, you know, there are techniques that are you feeling okay, can I get some key tips? Can Get qtip told me it'll be gone. It'll be moisturizer. Don't you worry there'll be something to replace. The key tips

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       are constant morphing need in your consciousness. I have this to this thing you say about three quarters of your time. This is that my inability to be present, particularly in pleasant situations really troubles me. I've, I am a, I need intensity in my life. You know, I had a recent, had an experience where I hung out with two men I didn't know well, separate occasions on the same day, the first part of the day. Very sort of a lighthearted, lovely occasion. And I sort of thought, why are you not fully present for this while you were observing this later on in the thousand situation was quite intense, but I was there, you know, I felt sort of somewhat threatened, not entirely safe, but I was very, very present. Something in my makeup means that I pay more attention when I'm.

Speaker 2:          00:31:38       No, no, no. See, that's only because the neuroscientist was so hip on this stuff. I would ask questions of the monk, of the neuroscientists and this is something he, he makes me feel better that you're not the only one if we, um, whenever we're focused on anger or you know, the negatives, that's sort of in a way us at our best, you know, we were built for danger. So with this kind of when there's nothing to think about, we really like it were, like you said in your book, we're all addicts to something, you know, it's now it's a lot of thought, you know, I think I have to have sex. I think I have to have q tips. I think I have to. It's just the chase. The chase is much easier when there's something fearful or Europe against the wall. It's just like a, an the animal lurks within us. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       it's almost like a chemical stream that's internally moving that we subsequently narrativize, but that's why once the q tips are achieved, the moisturizer will be required because the chemical in both continuous. What's so interesting

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       is that we feel the emotion first. Like I'll feel to drive and they put scanners on people. I'll feel it. And then two seconds later I'll think it. So your thoughts are the last to know in a way. So if you're driven, let's say you're in the addiction of anger, right? It'll kick in, you'll look for people, you'll make excuses like saying, oh yeah, I'll give up smoking tomorrow. Oh yeah, sure. I don't have to eat, but I think I will eat. Your brain will outsmart you every time, but it's your insights. They get the urge first. I sort of said in the book it was like a hive of bees and the queen is sitting there. She and she suddenly wants, let's say a starbucks. She thinks because she wants it. You're going to get a starbucks, but there's a zillion worker bees in slave bees in valet parking fees.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       They're already buzzing with each other and whoever buzzes the loudest has made the decision to get the latte. Then the queen things. Oh yeah. That's what I wanted. There's been a vote in every cell in your body and before you actually kick into something and we're. And the juice of anger and rage is so much more addictive. Nobody ever gets addicted to Kale. I'm really trying to create that. Don't you won't drinking stuff five a gallon, still don't like it. No. I once I thought, you know, I, oh, juice is good for you. So I made a big thing of it and I went on the train and drank it the next day I spent my day vomiting and they, then I figured out I had drunk the equivalent of four football because it's also his stuff for football fields. I had food in my body

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       drinking because of the stuff rubin's don't. So this, um, so the understanding consciousness from a mechanical perspective, the mind, the mind or people in academia so particular about the meeting, like my point is these are, if you have a mechanical understanding as expressed through that analogy around the hive mind and aspects of it, you know, the sort of the essential self being the queen bee and different aspects of the mind being different, you know, different bees within it. But what

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       these are the consciousness and we only know about the queen. So when you say consciousness, we have no idea

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       except of course many of the, uh, tech, the techniques that I am interested in which incidentally are sourced from the same place as mindfulness. Just another aspect of it. They say that we can attune ourselves to an aspect of consciousness that is free, is truly witnessing all else. And I will. Well, how could it be because you are remembering so you know, you, but what my experience of my experience of meditation is that it's only retrospectively that go, oh yeah. Wow. I wasn't in that moment. I will just then that's already happened. I wasn't thinking and cataloging what went on for one minute or a second or for five minutes, who knows, because my understanding of time it has been removed. Subsequently I narrativize it and go, oh, that was what was happening. So I'm having a different relationship with in those moments.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       I'm not thinking, uh, you know, I want to have sex or I'm not good enough, or this might, I'm afraid of this or a desire that there is a cessation in that. So that's it for me. That's another aspect of meditation that's important, which I think can change our relationship in a more, uh, a more total way or a more extreme way than just using it as a technique to calm down, which I think is bloody valuable. It is. And you're completely right. I get very excited about the mechanic that, but that's my problem. You know, the uncle say, oh, get off it. Come on. It is, it is a practice of spirituality and I have an allergy to that, but why? Because I, you know, I grew up at the time where I was rebirthed and then somebody shoved a crystal up my ass and then, you know, religious persecution drove your family from.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       That might be it. Yeah. I didn't even think of that. So if I can't see it or I can't smell it, I don't buy it. But of course the point of mindfulness is a. and I have a hard time saying it to develop. I always call it the c word compassion, which now I talk about in the book and presence. Those are also the point of it. But you see my proclivities always go to the daddy won't think I'm smarter than less. I know the, you know, the physiology of it. Daddy will think it's another cookie stuff, which Oh, I've just had a revelation. We must kill, must die killing us. I didn't realize you did. This is like 8,000 years of shrinkage you just did is the reasons probably I'm holding on to the sciences because my dad said everything I did was cool stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       There's not just that though, Ruby. This is all our father. Patriarchy itself is built on materialism and mechanistic thinking precisely because it can be commodified and sold and as soon as we begin to access aspects of consciousness or self that are beyond mechanistic and materialistic thinking, we begin to dive, dive voltage, understand access realms where our role here is no longer the role of the consumer, the civilian, the citizen, but something quite different. And the thing that fascinates me about your work, I, I think that what I think you're doing beautifully and what cannot be disputed as you're making it accessible to a p and people need like, like you. People need to understand it in terms of material and mechanics and patriarchy and if that gets people to understand it, that's brilliant, but what, but what I am fascinated by is how will people accessing this information without any of these tools.

Speaker 3:          00:38:11       And what else is there? Because I think you're monk friend is right. It is about compassionate is about presence. People have been talking about it for Millennia. Knowing that our salvation is in that direction and the father. I don't think he's solely and uniquely external, but the father like you have just expressed, we carry with us. It becomes all of our father, both inner and outer and it prevents us from exploring neurological circuitry which might give us, you know, uh, say new world to your time back at you. You should write a book. Well, I'm, I've got a pen. I've made the first tentative steps into the chest. That's a brilliant thing. And I just had an epiphany about my dad. Go on that. You're still trying to press. I can't. I can only do one pip otherwise now come on very. There are series of exactly what goes wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:38:54       Michael Epiphany's is they can do a moment dialogue. He gave me multiple, multiple epiphany's barely even moved off the chair and the epiphany's carrier on the train. She could never walk again. We're making sport at this rate while she's. The woman is permanently. Um, so, right. So you think that there is an obvious. Obviously there is an aspect of your own psychology even in your sort of enlightened, modern. You're right that the, the, the, the father and all of us motivated me to seek, but it means it's a very thin slice. You know, the mechanics are the thin slice. The bigger consciousness is the real mccoy. I obviously it wisdom. It's Buddhism. That's the real mccoy. I find it difficult to talk about, even though I studied it at Oxford, but these guys opened consciousness. You're right, they didn't define it because it doesn't have, you know, I think Einstein said, if we're not conscious, how do we define consciousness?

Speaker 3:          00:39:54       You know, they didn't define it, but they experienced it. These guys open up where it's timeless, you know, these are the 10,000 hour guys. It's timeless. There is no, um, you know, they do tests on these monks the whole time, you know, doing the, uh, there's a blink test where most of our Amygdala with sound, you know, because they show really disturbing pictures. But these guys, their Amygdala, it's more complicated than that. But they're not. Their Cortisol doesn't rush language, you know? So it worked. It happened to be that it could have been people who were astrologists. It could've been a scientologist, it happened to be Buddhism. Would you say that it happened to be, but they would say no. We have this technology passed down from the Buddha who had to stop saying it as a Westerner. You know what I'm saying? They knew who the WHO, you know, with our arrogance, we think, well, the fact that I was sitting there, what was he doing it meanwhile they knew everything and so what fascinates me is what else I know and what else they would teach us if we follow this down.

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       He's not going to just. Why do you think I live with a monk through your different modes? Well, he lives in my house but. But his job is, he works for Google and he works for facebook and he works for banks and they all long to learn this piece, you know? And how do is this guy, by the way, this monk 10, he, he's, he's the guy at the monk in the book. I'm using your gas now. He doesn't know we let the monkey. I shifted monkey. And is that bad? Well, yes. I think it is popped a monk in the spare room. The kids left. Right. And that there was this room and I thought that is so such a great move. But I met him. He was doing a conference and he. Boy, can he, he's articulate. You went to Oxford because he western?

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       Yeah, his mother. I know this is weird. You remember the Kumaras not mirror the other lady, she's his son. He said, sure. He's the son. So He's, he's, his story is unbelievable. And uh, he went, he was an addict and he went to clean up many years ago at Sammy link and they give a, they, they give a course, you know, for a year to clean up your act. And he, he got so into it. He became the fully ordained monk and I'm talking five years of silence. It's, they don't just pass this card out and I have to say his vibe in my house. I called it my air freshener in or the toilet duct, you know what I mean? You can't get a better vibe. Do you meditate with them? Yes we do. Yeah. Well, he travels the world, he's in Jamaica and now with Google I think because in tech stuff or doing meditation, they all long to do, you know, to learn meditation for different companies.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       They pay him and he, the monk isn't allowed to have money, so he's building retreats. So he's just built one in. Um, I think Southampton and then he's building another one in Scotland. They're not allowed to make money. So he's making the extreme ends of the country. He's coming around the coastline building retreats and he's not allowed to have money. It's curious, isn't it? The retreats for white people to kind of go and get it, get a massage. This is for, you know, Buddhist nuns and things. It also trade critiques are matching the retreats and retreats have that thing. You go to a hotel and there's a candle in a stone. So they go, oh yes or no. And now this appropriation of spiritual doctrine and the commodification of it is something that I am kind of aware of and it's peculiar when sort of great tech monoliths such as Google and facebook recognize its efficacy and essentially say, how can we commodify this?

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       How can we utilize this for profit? How can we turn the light? Because you said that you know that your experience has been that it's increased your compassion and it's increased your presence. Now you may find yourself in a situation where I presume you still have the drive that your wife had because it's part of my DNA. So what do you, what you're doing with it and let me know you're doing this, but how is it working for you with this? How is your ego? How is your sort of self laceration, self flagellation, how's that all going now? Well, it's got the same tone. You know, we don't change skin. It's, you know, I can feel the same qualities, but as I said, it's, I can't think of anything better. And Jon Kabat Zinn said it. It's more like a radio in another room. Like I can grab it and be Ruby again and part of me so addictive, you know, if you show me, I don't know, Jon Kabat Zinn gave me a really good review it last night for the book, the sides, you and he's my. That's my. He invented mindfulness. So my next thing was to write John and say, do you think I could come over

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       and do my show for you? I mean, he's just the ambition. I can feel it. You know, it's, it's an, it's like an animal. It's, it's the, you know, when I see the alien and I go, hey buddy, I know exactly how you feel, but it's not wild ambition that I, that made my career with no talent. I would not have developed talent, but it in the beginning I wouldn't take no for an answer. I just showed a bunch of me. They said, but you can't ever TV show. I said, I'm showing up. I'm here. Turn on the cameras. They said, well, who the hell are you? I said, I'm here. I've arrived. What about, so do you think this is something that can be for really interesting? You said something interesting and I went off.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       I'm happy with tangent. Do you think whereas it could be described and diagnosed neurologically or do you think there's another component to that? This drive, this willingness, this ongoing desire?

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       Well, it's dopamine. It's the same thing that gets people fixed and fixed on approval, fixed on rage, fixed on, you know, I now from doing. Who Do you think you are? I, I get it. My dad got out of their country two seconds before he would've been annihilated, but he never shut it off. When he got to Chicago, he ate his way through. He lived in rage. He became the tyrant he escaped from and that's how I lived. I will eat you alive if you get in my way and now it's just, it almost destroyed my family, whatever, you know, because I wasn't around when my kids were young and now because of, of watching the mind what? Just watching it and going, okay Ruby, but without whipping myself because you know if you hit the animal, it gets more violent. I go, calm down, calm down, let's use that anger when we need it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       This isn't perfect. This is my ideal. Cool. And then when you know when, when the man hasn't come to fix your fridge and it's been a year, use that anger. Well Ruby, go on the phone and do what you do, but then when you put the phone down then don't go call somebody up and go, you know what I did because that son of a bitch didn't show up and I do some of this off on it. Get off and then I've got it on and then I started picking other things to make me angry because I want more just like a junkie. So kind of understanding that I will give somebody hell and it's so tempting because it does taste more delicious than being nice. Wba said, every artist

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       you must create his own religion and you are creating your own religion. Sourced as it necessarily seems to be in your case from a secular understanding of modern scientific ideas and it is working for you. You're telling us some of your code, some of your methods for coping with your personal human condition. So now you're saying that some of that source material, the drive is being repurposed effectively and have your relationships. For example, if your husband and your three children are they, those relationships are improving

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       but they are improving. But then my kids are. My two daughters are in comedy now and the engine starting to were, you know, of me and I'm becoming Ethel mermen to push them and they go back off and I feel too, but eventually I do have to back off because it's your kids. I can't devour them the way my dad devoured me this time. I'm backing off. He ate me alive and you know, he died and we were not friends. What do you mean you live? He just, uh, he overwhelmed me, you know, they, it to mold me like a piece of clay. They wanted a rep, they wanted a photocopy and I wasn't it. So they kicked the shit out of me. He meant to be. I was meant to be. I do know, you know, like my mother was perfect. She spoke eight languages.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       She married a tyrant. Really bad move. A just a nice Jewish person, I guess not interesting for them to get something outside of a d because I was uh, I, I got really, I didn't get any grades. They were below the toilet because I was. Now I know I was traumatized. I couldn't think they'd say, what books did you read it? And I go, um, I couldn't. So I was putting the remedial class and my brain was frozen and I thought it was because I was dumb. There were traumatized by your father. They were wild. I wrote a book way earlier called, how do you want me? Yeah, how do you want me? And Carrie Fisher edited it and she said my parents were as crazy as hers. There's nothing else to say because hers are the a list. And my parents were as dark as it comes, as dark as it comes

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       by that you like. And this isn't to be diminishing, you mean sort of ordinary domestic darkness as in there's not talking sexual abuse and violence.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       Really a lot to do with say, oh, but there's violence and there's fear and there's psychological torture. Go on. No, no. Psych. I mean add is a nice man who I'm married. He said when he sees my parents, he wants to take their head and Jeremy Chapman, the side of a table because of the cruelty

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       and the Philip Larkin talk. Why they're responding to a sort of massive social trauma and political power. No, I didn't know where they came from.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       They didn't tell me about the Holocaust. It was never mentioned. So they passed it to me. So I had noises of. I never watched a film about Nazis because since I was a kid I heard screaming in my head and that's because they gently sublimated it and past that noise.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       You think that the law, I mean that's not genetic. Is it? That sort of some sort of manual psychological transference. Then I put my hands up, I don't know. Torture, curious. Mystery remains at the beginning of psychoanalysis as separate from neurology. There's these sort of distinct schools, Freud who it's too pricey, dreadfully believing the psyche is built upon repression and primarily repressed sexuality and young who maintained that there was that, there was a mystery and a, a collective unconscious and a transcendent aspect to who we are in sales on the button to. I'm into that dude. So what? So what, so you love young so that because for me, a lot of it, like in there like I love this Melville quote, I hear a lot of all human sciences but passing fables, meaning that if you'll look at and go, oh, how cute. Quantum theory, you know, like, so like w, w, w what in the work of young you find fascinating from your perspective of someone who understands numerology and the.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       No, but let me say the answer to everything isn't mechanics. It's just I hold onto it. That's my problem. I see. Yeah, it's not cool. It's not that reductionist, but it's me showing off, you know, for. I really liked meditation because it makes me much prettier. And um, and I sit and I sit in front of my Buddha and I liked, you really liked me then, but I think, hey, throw that Amygdala. It's like me tossing my dick out. Very nice ticket. Walsall smothered in Amygdala

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       by law. So what do you like about you? You're like, they're sort of archetype

Speaker 2:          00:51:26       the shadow. The shadow is so interested in chorus because, you know, Freud wanted to be a neurologist but you couldn't find a live brain, you know, so he was guessing there is no Edd, there is no metaphors and similes, metaphors. And he was kind of spot on too. But he went to literal. Whereas there is something that isn't mechanical, that isn't neuroscience of something that we're, that lives below as something looks. I, maybe it's my addiction, maybe it's the rage, but it's something that when the mind does meet it, the light shines on the darkness. There is a kind of piece. And that is mindfulness too. It's the dark meeting, the light, you know, it's the, it's the, it's the anima and the animus. There's a marriage. And so resident fighting yourself with those abusive thoughts, which I accept because if you get angry at those thoughts, this is a more mundane quote, but if you run from the monster, it chases you and if you face it, it runs from you.

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       So there's a marriage and he was very much about, you know, the male and the female side, the dark and the light. And that's as far as I can take it. He was right on the button. I mean, if that's not stealing from Buddhism. And he was into Mondalez. And of course archetypes is completely correct. We aren't one thing. I'm not just ruby who's like at this age and I don't feel female. I really don't. If you woke me up at four in the morning and said, what sex are you? I'd really have to say I don't know because I don't feel it. And we should understand we're not a stereotype. This body is a, is always a cesspool of genes and experience. And I could pull a card at any time, you know, I'm living proof. I was a moron at it as a kid. And then ended up in Oxford, who the fuck would have thought that one? It's just if you let it go and you really study because it ain't coming to you. That brain has got its neuroplastic. You can really develop this brain. It's going to be harder when you're older. But if I start learning Chinese and I start, you know, whatever I will have the wiring that a 30 year old doesn't have, I suspect,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       but a lot of people listening to this will suffer from mental health issues because you know, I attract them and obviously you do. Yeah, my people. So people can change. They can change. But let me just say with the disease, you know, again, we don't know about this. If you have cancer, you can't think your way out of it. Do you understand that mental illness? Well, you don't get the fear. You can lower the fear. You can with depression, you lower the shame. Which means that when I feel the little nips of the depression coming, I. because I have a little bit of an overview, I know what to do. I don't get busier, which is usually my way to go. I'm perfectly fine. I'll show up at your, I'll say showed a bit of charity for safe. The puffin, like I give a shit last time and I took up scuba diving at Christmas under brightened pair to show everybody else and then you end up in an institution for five months or take on a lot of work to get the cortisone, which is the very thing that's making the depression about depression, about.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       So this time I see it coming. I shut everything down because I respect that disease. I checked into a little retreat, no TV and I just sat and bit the bullet. It hurts like fuck, but it passed faster because the court is always down and that's why Kabat Zinn worked with people in pain. Focus on the pain because if you don't, your whole body is the essence of pain. Focus in on where it is. Okay. I'm not completely depressed, but there is depression, so that doesn't mean I still take medication, but I have a different relationship with it. Gosh, that's really fascinating and really, really helpful. And what I'm enjoying very much about this conversation is the evident marriage between spirituality and science. Uh, I feel that this is going to play an important part in our conversation. I mean, you and I, but I mean culturally going forward because my senses and it's one of the things we've been looking at continually over the course of these podcasts.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       But, uh, you know, Adam Curtis, it was that said, oh my God, the old thing is dead and the new thing has not yet been born. And like we're the age of managerial politics, this age of bogus, institutionalized religion, all these things coming to a halt and people are looking for ways to connect with their essence. Ways to understand their story. But it's got to have the right language. It's got a feel real. People can't pose through it. But I sent that. There's much in this stuff, but we've talked about are around union archetypes are mostly because we need a way to access the mystery and the mystery. I don't mean a woo woo thing. I mean, there is a terrain that can never be contained by our limited capacity for knowledge. That's why, I mean I, I might be pulling this out. We weren't going in this direction is this all comes down to it are, are working to as a tribe.

Speaker 3:          00:56:18       It all went wrong when we, when we suddenly went agricultural and we lost each other and I think in this world we're too isolated and I have these. I have these things called frazzled cafes were groups of people. Well, I didn't mean to swerve. I just good. I always the real cure. The real thing for compassion, this is the road is, is that we start to be human again with each other. You know, meeting it's smaller groups maybe and not doing cocktail bullshit where you have to say, how's your kid? Like I give a shit. You know, life is hard enough when you talk to people. It's completely superficial. So anyway, from my experience in the theater, I set up these groups. If you go to Fresno Cafe Dot Org, put down your name, we get in touch with you marks and Spencer's gave me all their cafes.

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       They shut it down and then groups of 15 meet every two weeks with a facilitator and all these people, it breaks your heart. It's so touching. They're scared in the beginning, like little frail humans and they're all ages, all colors, all you know. And suddenly they start to speak human to say they're not mentally ill. They're like all of us, you know, they opened their hearts and by the time you leave they're all holding hands. They've exchanged phone numbers and they've. Some groups have been going for a year. They have their tried and I know that that's part of all this is that we're so alone and nobody's comparing notes. I didn't like that idea. I think you're quite right about like. So you found out Harare. Come on and just talk to us through the sort of. One of the driving ideas in his book sapiens is how the advent of agriculture, which is obviously an economically lead notion meant a huge.

Speaker 3:          00:57:57       I'm not the expert mentors, so if people urbanizing coming together and people becoming sort of units in an economy, as opposed, I'm losing a certain necessary essential connection that lucky he explained to you that book agricultural works for one Straw society, but it doesn't work for the majority. Now bumped it up, bumped it up, bumping up and technology works for so many things just like they needed to go into the architectural stage. But we are. Our brain is still caveman. We don't know how to adjust to this population, but this technical, this, uh, this notion of theological, continued progress is underwritten by the same idea as agriculture. We are progressing, we are going forward. And I would say that that requires a mechanistic and materialistic Veltin to continue and to you say, no, no, no. There is a mystery. All the things that we access through the senses on by Necessity Limited and unless we find a route back to who we are, who we are as humans, I've wished something is like I have in my own life, a collective eyes to support groups and community groups where we do talk to one another and very open, honest plane.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       Why are you lucky? Yeah. It's like the gift of a of addiction in my case, but I think you know, but there's nothing to stop us creating societies based on a different model. Creating groups on a different model of, well, we need an only commune on the economic circumstances. Certainly struck me recently how ridiculous the kids socializing shopping malls, that's where they go. If you're not spending money, you're not congregate in, you're not coming together so we can ran sack and attack religious institutions or we like and God knows how corrupt they became, but it was a place where people went together to do something other than buy something exactly when. It's the same thing if, when we had churches in a gathering, again, we didn't need extraneous methods or a mental fitbit. That was a community was being human. It's a group that's human, not an individual.

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       An individual alone is like a finger. So, um, it's the loneliness and know the being open to saying, I'm fucked. I don't. I need to be contacting people and saying, here's what's going on in my mind is that what's going on in yours? And there will be such relief when that happens. What do you think of this thing that Yanis Varoufakis said when they were in their egos? The individually we exist in like he's sort of a person that don't really, like he said that he thinks matter came before spirit. So I disagreed with him. Talking about consciousness must've come from matter rather than Matt coming from consciousness, but he said that you, that we exist in dialectic, that we exist in relationship to travel, you know, what is self if there aren't other people to relate to. So our whole notion of what it is to be an individual is wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       So what do you, what in your work long. I mean they, you know, the mother builds the child's brain through her reaction that a kid is just a blob of fat unless the mother starts, which was my case, um, she tries to keep me up and then dressed me and gave me these hideous haircuts and I was sent to school as a blob of fat. Yeah. So, but the only way a human being is molded is through the compassion and the emotion of the mother. She teaches the kid what it is to be human. So we, I love this expression, we work like neuro Wifi. If I was in a rural state, I pass it straight to you. So we infect each other, but we could infect each other. Maybe with things like mindfulness, I can only teach you compassion and give you compassion. Now I can't do it alone, but if my, if the certain and there are chemicals involved, then oxytocin switches on chemicals, chemicals very.

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       I like a nice bit of Mumbo jumbo of a morning on a good road, but a good ball when you get that sexy thing. That's the chemical. I'm sorry to say. There is no consciousness involved. Something goes a little bit of juice goes to the penile area. I'm not talking about sex rule, but you did that all in your own mind. I love Mumbo jumbo means a rhubarb Halabaloo no, no monkey business. I meant the monkey business. No, but I'm saying compassion is could be reduced to a chemical and we do talk about in relationships like

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       why chemicals, where do they come from and what holds them together. What invisible grid. Let's see. I'm not as smart as you. That's the problem. A mess. Finally we agree on my pencil in egotistical. I'm indulgence. How you going to really be? Um, what I'm going to say. I like that thing you were just ending on about that. We find it difficult to individually rate because like when something happens around me and my parents, but I can't see it objectively because they are immeshed in the self that is witnessing it. So thank you very much for that. You've got go because literally there I'm wrapping this up, not because I want to, but because it's my train produces. It says you've got to get train in 25 minutes to go to east bumfuck. I can't imagine why I'm spreading the joy. Well, they need doing these shows.
