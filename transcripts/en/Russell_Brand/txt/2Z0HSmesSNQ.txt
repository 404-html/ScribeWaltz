Speaker 1:          00:00          Sort of like your online voice style, like through blogging and talking about Scottish independence. Now that you're in winter, more international level of notoriety. It's talking more about class, but I'm assuming that when you were talking about independent class was a big component. Can you talk to me about, I mean that's how I came Kim and our possession of conflict, the wife sections of the yes movement because you know like all movements there's a disagreement in certain pockets about what the priorities are and what posture we should assume generally saw. It was the sort of, for me and a lot of other people on the Ken of left and the radical left we we we didn't see, we didn't really buy into the idea that independence foster and then we'll talk about all this stuff later. We thought, no, hang on way. Got All this trouble of having independence.

Speaker 1:          00:54          If we've not got a really set up an idea of what we're, what I do and relation to taxation, social housing, welfare, drug policy, education. Like let's really get into the detail about that stuff because that may be the thing that mobilizes more people on the desk and franchise communities who are, you know, usually apathetic towards politics and for good reason. So I would be bringing up class usually on relation to art because I was creating music [inaudible] eh, the themes that are thought of Mlg, no of the independence, the beer. And uh, sometimes I would comment a conflict when I would go and perform at arts events that Wa like felt very sort of student here in middle class. And there's a certain expectation about what's appropriate. You'll notice from your expedience of a pr as a performer, although, because you're more established, no people will tend to come to whatever you are or an ass shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:52          But when you're just meeting people for the fast team and you're using the vernacular and a lexicon and, and, and, and things that may be perceived as vulgar on aggressive, then Eh, you just feel resistance and for Mina and reason then testing questions because one of my premed, new tress and, and dependence was that the regionalization of culture and Bratton means that a lot of great writers and artists from different places under your care who don't have friends and sort of London bubble that just get ignored or seniors cain off like firebrands or they get bracketed in a certain way. And so our thought independence's perhaps it'll viscerally, I fought independence is a way for us to create our own culture and our own, uh, and configure it out and I'll eat it. Makes sense to us. Um, but then there was a lot of self interest involved as well and hand say, you know what, it was sad of being a bigger fashion or smaller point.

Speaker 1:          02:52          You know, I've been ranting for 15 years. I'm very, I'm very competent. I'm very passionate about it. Um, but even in Scotland, the idea of wrapping with my own accent, it's like a joke for a lot of people. And uh, and that's even worse when you go, don't, so if you're not old or, oh, the grain rappers and all the MCS doe neil's are pervading, protested the of your key hot port. So it was just like all of those reasons. But then when Al got any further discussions, west people who were running these arts events and I was wanting to talk about class, or I had class beast disputes where for them then they were like, we'll talk about this later. We'll talk about this after. And they would try and play, keep me in various ways, obviously underestimate and how passionate I was about.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So that became a sort of a divergence point for me and a lot of other people were for the yes movement. That still remains to this day. I would see. What is the nature of this dispute? What is the nature of this disparity between what I'm picking out you're describing as a more educated or to use a classical or conventional word or more? Uh, the more bourgeois aspect of the left and the working class contingencies and then also this dispute. Oh, also a national fooled at the sin and over always will. So it's, it's not, I wouldn't characterize it as a dispute, although it does manifest as a confrontation and acrimony. I would characterize it as, um, things getting lost in translation. So we currently think about culture as a sort of continuum where people, uh, near the bottom are waiting to sort of graduate to become legitimate by virtue of their willingness to either conceal or renounce those indicate who they actually are with.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Whereas assay working class culture as a parallel culture and that there are many contradictions, x interest at ease lessons. There's a lot of wisdom, a lot of things that are very distinct. Uh, I mean, I've been socially more bail enough and wife that I've maxed a lot across a ravine. So over the years I've built up an understanding of some of these fault lanes and that the big donor and communication often can come from simply a difference in a sense of urgency or priority on the watts that someone newsies. So what you might see is what you meet cs passion. Someone sees it as aggression, pushiness of what you might see as polite. Someone thinks his pattern isn't, it's the combination of all of these little instances where people come away from an attempt to mango across the ravine, that that just becomes natural to sort of recall back to where it's comfortable, where people are gritty.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Whereas Alec, to be on the lane, I'm more comfortable in the medal. I come from a working class background, I'm passionate about it. But back then in my youth there would be people trying to police how I spoke that wants the are years, the things that I was interested then a very rigid idea about what a young man should be. And I resented that and challenge that. But then at the same time on the other side, then even just the things that I want to talk about and the way that I wouldn't if fema is changing, no, cause I've kind of been caught saying the bay, a few legitimate people notes about like, oh this we must have Garvey. But beforehand it was very, it was very much a struggle. I had to kind of manipulate my way into the middle class, feels like stop wearing a hood.

Speaker 1:          06:31          They start wearing a blazer, wearing a pair of glasses instead of a baseball cap and learn to talk. Like middle class people were alarmed that for them that's the sort of form of currency, not necessarily being clever but sonin clever on an amount of that. I sort of picked up on that. That's when I became more socially mobile than perhaps my education with the valid. Maybe make some good points there. One of the things I recently learned about the way that hedge money is constructed is with the imposition of a narrative and have a language within it. And the way I learned it when I'm doing this course at university, they said that the way that the western world or so called secular work deals with Islam or Middle East and countries is with the assumption that there's a, a narrative for Islam has to go through that will conform to what uh, post, uh, like I like that, that create, that Christian history has been through lie a prostin ecm and Catholicism is secularization when as you did when you were describing working class culture, the entity, it's a parallel narrative that there is, there is a separate Islamic narrative, there's a separate working class narrative and you don't have these things need, didn't necessarily conflate and certainly what you would call I suppose secondary or sub narratives.

Speaker 1:          07:55          It can't be subsumed in the infocomm is dominant narrative. Yeah. So like, yeah, I like that mate. What you said that you have to even on the level of lighting, the way that you accessorize pop on a pair of specs instead of a baseball cap to be more sort of identifiable. But then when you do that, you comment in conflict with where you actually come from, you up pop gagan a blazer and people are like, well, your hood there, who do you hang? Yeah, and saw that actually is not as much as as as that. That has been difficult at times. It seem team of kind of like I've tried to stay true to what I wore one, and really with the book, what I was trying to do was engage multiple people from multiple backgrounds at the scene. Tell

Speaker 2:          08:42          you.
