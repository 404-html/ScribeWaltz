Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Welcome to under the skin where I ask what's beneath the surface of people we admire of the ideas that define our time of the history. We are told, this show is sponsored by me and my rebirth tour. The next couple of shows are sold out, but there's still some tickets available for Salford second of August, 20th of September. Tor Key, madam 27th of September, Lester, first of October. Russell brand.com for tickets. Now it's time for under the skin. Have a look it, get under the skin with me, Russell brand.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       Under the skin. We look under the superficial cutaneous surface of issues individually, histories, myths, and stories. Today we will be talking to will store an award winning writer, a man who, if you were to accuse him of being a photographer for even a moment, it would smash any camera in the district. Is features have appeared in various publications including the Guardian, The Times, the observer and Gq. He's the author of the critically acclaimed books, the heretics adventures with the enemies of science and the novel, the hunger, and the howling of killing loan. We're here to talk about his book, Selfie among other things and topics that come off, selfie to discover the ideal of where the perfect idea of self came from, White, so powerful on wherever there is any way to break it. Dangerous, spelled as a fair introduction will often as extremely fair.

Speaker 2:          00:01:45       Thank you Russell. Thanks for coming on our show, mate. It's really nice to talk to you now. This is one. Those ones were like, I don't. We don't know each other, but we've had quite a good chat before the podcast started, haven't we? We have a very good chat. Yeah. We plunged right in with the nature of reality as experienced through computer games, which pretty good place to start because one of the things with this point in this podcast is to. I'm going to university doing this course, religion and global politics. It may make gave me a thirst and an excitement. That knowledge I've always been proud of. My is in the Noyce or I learned that mean and then actually I've learned some things. I think no, it's really good to distill and to understand and have some of the language of academia. So that's the point of interest is you know, what's this book Selfie? I've just read a brief intro and obviously understand what the modern term means. What do you want people to get from reading that book?

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       What it is is the, it's the, it's the story of the Western self. So what it's doing is saying that, you know, in, in our modern culture we're surrounded by this image of the perfect self and it's a really particular kind of odd image. It's this person in their twenties and they have this fat stomach and they kind of are very entrepreneurial and they're kind of globally minded and they kind of look a certain way and act a certain way and it's really sort of telling the story of, you know, who is this person and and kind of how it, how did it come to be? What'd you reckon that's come from classicism? Yeah. So I think the story really begins for me two and a half thousand years ago in ancient Greece and I was really amazed by this whole body of psycholo psychological research I came across that talks about this idea of the geography of thought and it's this idea that who we are as a people is very much a product of all.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Back then it was geography. So in ancient Greece is a code really particular an unusual place. So it wasn't like a nation of what you think of. It just acts like 100 individual city states and there was a very particular ecology and ancient Greece. So it's mostly, I mean, I'm sure you've been to Greece, but like it's mountains descending to see a little rocky islands. So what you couldn't do in ancient Greece was you couldn't be like a farmer, like in East Asia, there was like big, big irrigation projects as big rice grain projects. So to get along and get ahead of it at the same time. Yet at the same time in, in East Asia, uh, you know, you had to be a part of a collective enterprise. But in ancient Greece it was different dsp, a hustler because there was no big industry, so you have to be a potter or uh, or you know, to make olive oil or to be a fisherman and um, and so you had to be yet to sort of push yourself forwards.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       And the other kind of ramification of it being so coastal was that they started trading with all these other countries and so they began sharing ideas and coming across sort of new and novel ideas. And that kind of encourages is this a tradition of debate? So debate was like a big thing you could do and, and so, so the, the ecology forms this kind of way of being this kind of individualistic way of seeing the world. And then from that comes all these ideas of, you know, what is a human, what a human is, this kind of individual node of potential perfection and destiny rather than us being a collective, uh, part of, uh, uh, just, just one could have node in a kind of collective reality. So you see interesting things in ancient Greece beginning, obviously there's the myth of Narcissus, which is very relevant today, but things like that, they venerate celebrity do the myth of narcissus just in case people are listening to this, I don't know nothing about.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       And it says, I've been listening to me for anything because a pretty good idea. Well let's say in ancient Greece that, you know, they, they, they had, they had this kind of version of celebrity and they would tell you know, these, these great myths and one of one of them has courses. It's got narcissists who fell in love with his own own image and the other thing that you get literally then it is reflection and then fault. Oh my God, this kid is lovely. Yeah. I think I'd like to get in there and snuggle him. And then did he drown? Think he drowned? Yeah. Yeah. In a way it's stupid like not to go out on them and it was like a moment ago and he's wearing those earrings and that top I put on reflection, but I suppose the point of a myth, sorry about that noise that we were in this place where there's continual construction, maybe it's a metaphor like, like it's as opposed to the point of that myth is about how it's easy to get lost in the self and to make this self total.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       And that's why it's relevant. New York. It's no coincidence that the ancient Greek myth, because it was this, it was this whole environment where the individual was seen as this node of kind of possibility. And so I contrast this in Selfie with what was going on in, in, in East Asia at the time. And that was the land of Confucius. And so to get along and get ahead in, in East Asia, you had to, you know, be part of this sort of big group. And their idea of the perfect stuff was totally opposite to the aristotle. He notion, uh, you know, the, the idea of somebody who seeks notoriety was, was known as the inferior self and the superior self doesn't seek that notoriety, so and so that, that all feels like ancient history and it is ancient history, but it's all really relevant today. So when these psychologists do these studies on, on Westerners versus East Asians, they say that they, they literally see the world in, in a different way.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       So if you put a Westerner in front of, uh, they, they show a video of a fish tank for three seconds and then the front of a fish tank because this very flashy show, offy narcissistic kind of fish, right? And, um, it sounds like a bloody good guy. He's that and then monitor the movement of your eyeballs every millisecond. And what they find is that if you're a westerner, you will pretty much be studying that individualistic, narcissistic fish at the front. But if you're from East Asia, your, I will be constantly moving and judge looking at the context. So they're literally seeing the world in a different way. And this has major ramifications even down to how we take selfies. So when you, when they, when they study the content of selfies, East Asian selfies are much more likely to be a big group of mates, a big gang of people together. But Western self is a much more focused on the individual narcissistic face. So huge sort of huge ramifications. And it all begins with the ecology of our people 2000 years ago, which I just found extraordinary.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       Well, I like that story. That's a good story. I like to think about that little show of fish. I can't stop thinking about him. I want to see him. He sounds like a right little, lovely name getting more out if me that have tried to track my own movements that have gotten always looking at it. He's putting his hand in the fish tank kitchen named Caitlyn it. Even in his own name, he took it off. I might come back yet. And that to follow me on. CCTV footage just darted off. So I'm like, the things that we think of as the central such as our attitude towards individualism are themselves constructs. And you can trace historical narratives because we added me near that Yanis Varoufakis you couldn't have been clever. He said one of the things he said, well sure, I liked it. I've been saying it myself ever since then.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       And sometimes I don't credit him with it. There's no such thing as self. He says you guys, uh, we exist in dialectic dialectically existing conversation with others. In fact, I think it's even in my standup now and I like it. Yeah, it's one is a good bit. Like I talk about the notion of like, you know, how can you individually exist without relationship, you know, so like, like any years actually Greek, isn't it? Yeah. I found, I was thinking about like, you know, like the tradition of democracy within reason come out of grace, didn't it? Because the thing I think about when he was talking about the itemized

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and entrepreneurial society, which fate, individualism also had slavery in it. That might be craft bloody lazy path. Yeah. We about two and a half thousand years ago. So democracy. Yeah, still wasn't right. It was a narrow as bullying number of men that could vote for that. It was only 50 years at democracy. It was, it was kind of a bit of a flash in the pan, but the fact that it came to existence, even for that narrow range of news was it was pretty extraordinary because think of that in these days though. Fifty years you'd think when you're like 50 years ago now the sixties, you're feeling like, you know, that's like the other people. So like, you know, but like if something, if we create some sort of utopia that lasted for 50 years, it was a denim democratic utopia. But regardless of what you're saying is that the crucible of individualism as we regard it, started there with this particular tradition that we can contrast to a different tradition and that to this day you can see even in simple prosaic example such as a Selfie or people bug out of show off fish and also a major one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       So, you know, one of the, this Guy Richard Nisbett, who's the professor kind of studies this as a pioneer of this guy, said to me that, um, you know, in China for example, the idea of somebody suffering unfairly for the benefit of the group is far more acceptable to them. To us that's a horrific human rights abuse, but it's much more acceptable in that culture because they privileged the group over the individual. So there, there are also bad effects. So I'm not sample of someone's suffering for the group. Well, so some of the human rights abuses that, the communist dictator mind that, well, I mean, so they don't mind it, but, but they're much more prepared to kind of tolerate abuse.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       They privileged the group and you know, I talked to a Japanese anthropology talks about, you know, the culture in Japan that a CEO of a company might commit suicide if they've let the company down and that might be seen as an honorable act in Japan still today. Right? Well, at least he killed himself. He did the right thing. And that's almost a cliche though, isn't it like a kamikaze idea. And sort of slightly different, I'm sure it's less prevalent today, but you mentioned her, she was saying that it's still secret, still going to generally understood as to understand why you would do that. And she had even in informal parties, if she, she, she says, you'll introduce yourself to somebody who's. Hello, I'm so nice, David, you'll, you won't say I'm David. And then it comes up in conversation a bit later on that you work for Sony. You say, hello, I'm Sony's David. So the idea of the group is much more front and center in their consciousness on David by either look at more new shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       You can always that shrimp salad. Oh it's for everybody. And we in the lot of way work for Sony. That's why I'm here. That's aristotle and yeah. Yeah. And then why would you identify with the corporate entity? So they say, well you do think that capitalism does this. Then it means that because everything is stripped and made it into an economic model that people don't feel any sort of sense of purpose or identification other than their own individual sort of identification with themselves because communal values have been sort of radically and dramatically broken down over time to lose. We think of ourselves as consumers. That becomes our role. Got No social order would. That's the story that handily, that Selfie, it was absolutely so, so, so the, so the beginning of the book, we begin with how the ecology led to a certain way of being an introduce.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       It's kind of the foundational idea with the book and that is that when we're born, it's as if the brain asks at one fundamental question, it says, who do I have to be in this environment in order to get along and get headed in this tribe that I'm in and you know, and there are sort of various interesting sort of neuro biological things that happen. You know, the brain kind of calms itself down as a function called neural pruning. We're actually carved itself down, um, to kind of meet the culture that it finds itself immersed in. And you're right, so, you know, during the middle part of the 20th century, it was actually much more of a collective time in the West in both, you know, it was a time of welfare state. It was a time of unionization. It was a time of a regulation on banking or businesses job for life.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       And what sprang out of that environment where the hippies, we had this very communalistic worldview and if you compare who we were in 1965 to who we became in 1995, that's 20 years, that's half a generation. It's an absolute transformation in who, who we are. What happened right in the middle of those dates, neoliberalism Thatcher and Reagan came along and said, right, forget all this collectivization. I found this interview that you did in 1981. Really quite sinister where the stipend senator Tom said, all right, mom, Margaret Thatcher, you know, what's your plans, what are you going to do? And she said, Oh, you know, things made me kind of very cross about our policies for the last 30 years. It'd been very collective and I want to sort of bring back individualism and that's a kind of. I'm paraphrasing there, but what then what you said is the object is sort of method is economics, but the object is to change the soul.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       She wanted sinister and it's especially because that's exactly what she did. Couldn't both though the economics, but the object is the truth. That's exactly what she said, Margaret. I mean not actually as a person, but it's a character that you don't just look at people with detached from the actual reality of what they historically did and just sort of think of him as a character because like Margaret Thatcher, mum had said he had to write a poem about Alliance for state the windshield, that de facto state funeral. I'm like, he said he looked at videos to inspire him and he said that when you watched it you sort of think, oh my God, he's brilliant because he's so forceful and powerful and very opposite of the incipient managerial technocrats that find themselves in a position of government today with the notable notable exception of Donald trump.

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       But so like there was a clip that's very, that is a curious observation that there was a sort of an agenda to change the way the individual. So that relationship with society out in a central level. Yeah. And, but I mean, you know, so obviously she had no understanding of this rich and visit work because it hadn't happened yet, but she was absolutely right in what she did. I mean, and it happens really quickly. So in 1992, what you find is something really weird happening in our maternity wards. So for generations, parents called their children by Richard Elizabeth Margaret, like ordinary names. And suddenly you get parents finding unusual and distinctive and kind of crazy names for their kids because they want their children. Their words are, the psychologists have found this out to stand out and be a star is the beginning of the keep fit revolution and then by the middle of the atheists we have the, we have the Yuppies, you know, so, so, so, so we start changing because who we have to be in order to get along and get head has been redefined by neoliberalism of course, near near liberalism is this idea that they wanted to gamify all of human society, the ones that are human life into a massive competition of self first itself to get rid of the welfare state as much as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       Get rid of the unions, get rid of all that red tape is they called it. Everybody has to look after themselves and you know, that's what we find today. You know, young, young people are these very ancient Greek nodes of individual profit and all their brands, their entrepreneurial, you know, it's Kinda Thatcher's wet dream in a way. Disturbingly, that's kind of what we see today. I'm just thinking about Margaret Thatcher having a way to it. Thinking about the clammy of Maggie Smash. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       And I like don't dislike the idea, I'll be honest with you, will, I'm enjoying it. I may revisit that Meryl Streep film the Iron Lady with this in mind. She's dreaming of millennials. That's who those are, the people that are in that dream, but do you. Right? So, okay. So you talked about the plasticity of the mind prune in itself to be opera bull in whatever context it finds herself in. But if they're, you know, this is a 50 years be a sort of a period of a democratic blip in ancient Greece or the journey from collectivism to massive individualism from the sixties to present day is a small period of time. Excuse me, from an evolutionary perspective. So don't you reckon that is in right about really. And we'll be able to turn people nicest pie

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       shake of title. Well I think there are, there are causes for optimism. So in the book or you know, I, I write about sort of trump and brexit. I know we don't think about those things in terms of optimism usually, but I'm in. I kind of connect those with the rise of Corbin because I think what we're seeing is the beginnings of a mass rebellion. Yeah. Against

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       neoliberalism. Could it be a handsome young Jeremy Corbyn yourself in that moment saying, oh thank you. I'll take that as a copay picture. There'd be a video of asked. See to see that. Yeah. Well there's a couple of minutes and it, because, well I started to like about Jeremy Corbyn was that it was still and sort of like, you know, before all of the sort of hubbub of the laugh, the election and they're, you know, their various leadership campaigns within the Labor Party. There was an idea that it was a bit fuddy duddy and you can see that sharp and him up suit wise, but like an hair cut by Zambia dwis. But now I like is this sort of stillness and when he's on things being sort of badgered and berated that he has a kind of like he's been through it so many times, you know, I, I kinda like it. And yes, evidently it is what I felt like, you know, if there is a corollary between trump and corbin, it's authenticity, that these are both people that feel genuine and like there's an integrity. We talked to Naomi Klein and she said, yeah, but Donald Trump's at massive liar, but there's a brazenness to Donald Trump. There's something brazen that like, compared to the light, the Hillary Clinton never all

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       crap politician he's going on about how about a bomber is the founder of Isis that's fairly brazen. Wow. This anything, alright be prejudiced. But, but, but I think what, what, what we, what we forget to do sometimes in all our re outrage about Donald Trump is actually look at what he was saying. So what he was saying during that campaign was, I'm going to build a wall with Mexico and I'm going to make apple put a factory in Wisconsin and things like this. And Steve Bannon, his right hand man was going. The problem is we've got it. The middle class in America was built the middle class in Asia and you know, that's true. And so, so, so what he was mounting was an argument against globalization. That's what, that's what he campaigned on. And of course globalization is the neoliberal projects. What nearly was want is to create off the world one single perfect global market.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       And if you're a right wing person with a right ring brain and you are fed up with neoliberalism, that's going to be what you're thinking about is globalization is immigrants. It's, you know, all these foreigners coming in here and knocking our wages down. But if you're a left wing person looking at exactly the same problem, you're going to be looking in a different direction. You're gonna be looking at regulation. We need more regulation. We need to cut this inequality. We need to sort out these terrible house prices. We need to cut student debt. So, so it feels to me like these sort of these big political earthquakes, a terrible cliche that have happened, are both responses to the same problem just but from opposite ends of the political spectrum. There are our responses against neoliberalism. So I really do feel that this is the beginning, the kind of the tumultuous beginning of a big period of world revolution in, in our lifetimes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       The worrying thing is that because there's such different worldviews attacking the same problem, it's going to be a period of conflict. I think new worldviews are going to emerge because I would like to defy those taxonomies and systems of categorization. This is what I think could, could occur because information can be liberated so rapidly now. I think it's possible. Will that tells me a little bit for. Go on one of my rant. It looks a little bit about what you're saying about like, uh, the bogus self esteem revolution and it's reappropriation of sort of religious and spiritual principles to tell me what you mean. So the heart, the heart of Selfie. I did a big, big, long investigation into the self esteem movement because this is what was the self esteem and movement. What is it? Well, it says this idea engine, it comes out of the human potential movement of the sixties and seventies in America.

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       So in all that, uh, s comes out of it, so it actually begins. Excellent. This'll institute in big Sur in California where I actually went in there actually. Yeah. I went there for the book. I just, I go and do a big sort of. What did you do? A course? Did you ever do a work? She's in a really nice hotel down the road, call me. There's this thing down there and I remember seeing her and Adam Curtis documented truffle archival look at him. I went there to have a look at them and they were, they weren't doing anything else. It was, you know, they have that yoga workshops without. I did what this course called the Max, which was this horrific kind of thing about finding your authenticity, but it's very similar to the workshops they were doing in the sixties and seventies a bit, but it was all business ideas of human potential.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       What was going on in the sixties and seventies when it was being in the screaming at your own genitals. Yeah. Yeah. So I tell these horrific Thursday note for me, Dylan, they called them encounter groups. So the I say so it's like imagine sort of big brother, but, but, but, but, but much more intense, you'd be shot in a room for hours and hours and hours name with complete strangers and your job is to be as honest as possible to that stranger. Well, people had nervous breakdowns, you know, nervous breakdown when you sit down nearly at one, because if I start saying little things going in my head, I'd be locked up because it's too much going on in there. But. But the but the reason they thought that was a good idea, it's important when stands because there was this big revolution in America thinking. So for generations back through Freud, Freud, back through all of Christianity, the idea of what a human being is, a human being is bad.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       There's original sin, there's Eda was complex, we are bad. And then in poster America, this guy called Carl Rogers comes along and has this new idea. He says, actually, no, that's wrong. Human beings are amazing. They're fantastic. They're full of latent potential and what we need to do to. Well, you just turns out of nowhere, a few minutes of brilliant where he was extremely influential, uh, you know, whereas you getting a bloody sort of backbone from how come you can come out with such a contrary point and everyone goes, no trouble as well, always said was he got, well, again, I think it comes out of the economy. So, you know, so in postwar America, the economy was changing mat massively. So there was a big exodus of people from the country into cities, uh, women were now in the work, in the workforce, much more following the second world war.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       So it was the era of Corp Man of suburbia or revolutionary road. So it's a much more optimistic personality focused time. So again, it's, it's always economy that underpins these big changes in it and the big social movements. And it seems to me that the reason that that may have had sort of tacit relevancy because both the projects of urbanization, corporatization and mass industrialization, they're all turning people into a bloody great big lump. And so you need an accompanying myth of individualism as a sort of tonic so that you can get through your job. Were you doing bugger all in your individualism is reduced to me. I'll buy this phone if you want, without laughing. Which I think the historical kind of traditional historical theory about how the world changes is a bit wrong for exactly those reasons is, is that they tell that crazy story of somebody comes along with a new idea and everybody's fluxing goes, yeah, that's a great new idea.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       That's not how it works. People have new ideas all the time, but what we choose the person who has the idea that feels right and it feels right because our economy is in a certain way. So it's, it's, it's the environment that changes first and then we kind of lock onto somebody who has an idea that feels kind of truthy. So this was Carl Rogers and anyway, so he, he, he was, he, he was just like this guy that kind of had this new idea that. And that's why encounter groups came. He pioneered encounter groups. This idea that in order to become perfect, we had to kind of, you know, reach this kind of inner core or as perfect as possible, as perfect as are potentially artists to be. And so from a selling something in that, that there will like, you know, like going on a journey of self discovery and honesty would be useful for an individual.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       Yeah. But, but, but, but, but there's a couple of problems with it and one of them is the is the, you know, what is the authentic self is this idea that if we just strip away or the, or the planet has a nice. It is, um, uh, the society layers upon us that there is this perfect in a cell that we know that isn't true in a sense. You know, that there is no such thing as the authentic self with the, with the big caveat that we do have a distinct personality, a biogenic kind of personality. But so, so, so, so, so how did these ideas come to the self esteem movement of the Nineteen 80 [inaudible]? So John Vasconcellos was this very powerful California politician who, uh, who knew Carl Rogers and corrosion, it's got sort of mentor to him and in the eighties and the, in the neoliberal is he, he had kind of a kind of near liberal kind of remix of these excellent ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       So he decided that he called self esteem is social vaccine. He literally thought it was this medicine that we'd all take self esteem, the self esteem medicine, uh, and cocaine stay medicine. Oh my God, I know, but that you'd done your job. But that's what he thought. He, he thought the self esteem was going to cure homelessness, domestic violence, uh, in a teenage pregnancy, drug abuse, everything. And not only that, he thought it was going to make us more competitive contestants in this great near liberal game. So he, he, he, he was the second most powerful politician in California. And he proposed, he sets up this three year task force to investigate self esteem. And he said, I'm going to get these, these scientists to, to, to, to prove that there was a causative link here, that if we give people high self esteem, they will become more perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       That become better near liberal kind of contestants in how happier and healthier so. So fast forward three years he tells the world, I've done it. The scientists agree with me, self esteem as a social vaccine. That is an amazing transformation. At the beginning. Everyone's laughing at this idiot from California, like this joke. He's literally a national direct Johnny Carson's cracking jokes about this thing on the tonight show. You know, he's, he, he's a laughing stock, but then it comes out with his news. I've done it. I've got these seven University of California professors to study the data and they've backed me up. Self esteem is a social vaccine and he's everywhere. Then he's big. He's flown to the Soviet Union, has talked to the communists about self esteem is an oprah talking about self esteem. And then of course I'll protect, gets hold of the idea and it goes everywhere. He becomes this kind of celebrity.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       And the idea that goes around the world and it changes everything. It changes the way we raised our children. It changes the way we teach our children. It's that whole era, which I think we both grew up in. All of your wonderful. You're special, you're amazing. Have a Rosetta for coming 14th place in the sports day. And what you see in the psychological data is from the 19 no, you. Narcissism starts going up. So. So we start raising, raising a generation of children who are more narcissistic year by year, and then the, the kind of cohort that came before them. And of course that's the selfie generation. These are the millennials. And so what I do in the book is I go back to. I spent a year investigating John Vasconcellos. He's since died and his taskforce and what do you mean investigator down taskforce members I went to.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       There's a big archive in Sacramento, the selfish all their documents. I've got all their documents. I've got audio recordings of their meeting. Was it. It was amazing because what some people knew was that there was a, there was a problem. That data didn't kind of say what Fastco Fast Evan Got Invesco Oakland, Vasco, what? Vasco said it said, but I tracked down one task force member who described the whole operation in his words is a fucking lie, and he said, he said, he said I was in a room with it and now he's. I was in a room with vascular when he saw the scientific reports for the first time and he said if the legislature who fund them, if ledger to see what's in the reports are going to shut our task force down and he said from that moment on, the whole thing got covered up. So it's incredibly consequential exercise and changing who we are, which really did have a big impact on who we are today was, as I kind of sort of revealed itself.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       He really was based on a massive delinah deliberate coverup and I even tracked down if I've got Andrew Mecca who was his right hand man, who cheerfully admitted to me when interviewed him. Yeah, we covered it up. Yeah, we covered it up. We, you know, we, we, we deliberately went out on a mission to kind of spin our way out of this problem that the scientists were saying that there is no causative link between self esteem and all these virtuous, amazing results with my dancing research. Your ideas crap. Yeah. I mean I actually, I actually found a tape recording of the meeting at which the lead scientist, a guy who's a sociologist called Dr Neil smelser. I actually found an audio recording of the meeting in which he announced to the group what the results were and he was basically saying is we're not getting what you want us to get it, you know, where we are seeing a link between self esteem and good outcomes.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       We're not sure if it's causative or not. So what he's saying is, for example, in education, you can see that people who have high good exam results have better self esteem. So what Vasco thought was that the self esteem was causing the good exam results, but actually what's causing the service day. Exactly. Exactly. So, so yeah, and then I found another tape from a couple of months later we were people, including this guy I interviewed with getting blowjobs all day. Good self esteem. I founded say with this meeting, I just want to suck letter steam right out of their belly pipe. Sorry about that. So stuff that I've always found amazing, uh, of this kind of rebellion that happened at this meeting, including the guy that I tracked down where they stood up and said, I'm really uncomfortable with what you're saying to the media because we're saying that we found this link and we haven't got this link.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       So come on, shut up. It was just sort of get stuff done like that because I would have fought self esteem is a good thing. Well there's healthy self esteem is a good thing. So there's a guy called Professor Roy Baumeister, who I also tracked down who was the guide that kind of busted this if we didn't much to track it down. I just found his email and emailed him. But he said there is such a thing as off the bat side, looking at pebbles tweaks, bloke to get like an aboriginal tracker to find him. But now he of course he said there is such a thing as healthy 70, but if it is earned. So you know, Einstein had really good self esteem will probably we guess Bhava dressing up. Did he say that to staff? That pair of trousers twice. Banks out there. I'm to do some maths and that's Einstein.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Everyone. But it also is an interesting guy because his father was a literal Nazis. Father fought with a narcissist and Second World War and as Roy Baumeister said, Hitler had high self esteem too and it would appear certainly believed in many of these ideas. Yeah, absolutely. Mystery. He's a mystery because I think he might have been a bit down on himself at times when he was on his own and felt terrible will. That's the self esteem, the self esteem. If that says, says that all kinds of bad antisocial behaviors are because it's deep down, you don't love yourself about you. Then what got you off on this mission? Well, because that was, that was the kind of the story of my early life, so I was an idiot growing up. Like I failed all my exams. I didn't concentrate at school, got in trouble with the police. I was alcoholic, drug abuse, like the whole staff and through my twenties I was in therapy, flop my twitter is trying to sort my head out and the constant refrain from teachers at school from the counselors was always, you've got low self esteem and your parents didn't love you.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       I'd very victorian, you know, classic English parents, didn't, they never liked, loved you enough and that's why you're so unhappy. And I completely bought this. I completely believe this. And I bought this idea that my problem deep down was that I didn't love myself. I had low self esteem and that what I had to do to cure it was to get high self esteem. So I did all these things to get high self esteem. And then I spoke to this. Roy baumeister found out that it was all a myth and it was only like six years ago and it was like, oh hang on. So you're saying that everything I thought was true about myself, this whole journey I've been on of self improvement has been based on bullshit and it was based on the language may be um, sort of bogus, but what ultimately aren't we all looking for some sort of form of what I want to say connection.

Speaker 1:          00:31:56       It's not like you want to go round, rambled puffed up on a theme or mad like a bull frog snack or high as a kite on silliness, but you don't want to feel terrible feelings of worthlessness. And one could imagine that a childhood that didn't have physical affection and, and I don't know, validation in it might lead someone to not feel. Yes. Well I think, I think there was a, there is an element of truth in that. So, so where the book ends up is, is with this idea of what is the self and there is a quarter, everybody's sense of self and that's a lot of that story is genetic. So a lot of who we are used is down to just an accident of genes. And so what I, when I do my personality test, what I am is I'm high in the trait of neuroticism.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Neuroticism goes hand in hand with low self esteem. So if you suffer from low self esteem, you're generally a high neurotic. But because it's a relatively stable personality trait, it means that you can't actually do much about it. But you're right to say I was born with a neurotic brain. If I'd have had more loving parents, I would have been brought up happier but, but this combination of a neurotic brain and on parents that weren't very affectionate isn't a nasty combination. So they did have. But. But the thing is, the point is you can't do anything about it once you're in. You're a pretty neurotic brain. And Mum, mum, she couldn't have given me more smothering theater. Our mom, she loved the hell out of there. Oh Russ. But you're very confident there's the result. So you can live a terrible drug addict and an alcoholic and written with self doubt and all that kind of stuff and sort of fast moving mind that for forever looking for something that probably isn't even there, but don't you think like that?

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       The isn't the, some of the ideas I'm interested in here, we'll is that wherever, you know, wherever it's a biomechanical model that we prefer over some kind of Mumbo jumbo spiritual model. Liberty essential self is interconnected and they all sorts of important to me is the possibility and potentiality for change both on an individual level, in a social, cultural level. I believe in change very much because I was a drug addict and now one day at a time, no drugs, different behaviors. It depends. It depends what you mean by change. So of course if we can heal, right? So of course we can heal. So I'm much happier now as a 40 year old then I wants us a 22 year olds fucking miserable. It's 22 year olds. But I'm much happier now, you know, because I have a good, uh, a wife that, that helps me when I'm going a bit mad and things like this.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       So of course we can heal and you've obviously been on a big journey of healing, but we can't do it is. So the whole human potential idea that we still have very much with us today is this toxic lie which tells our young people you can do anything you want to do and be anything you want to be. You just have to dream big and kind of go for it. And that's very inspirational. But it's also very, very dangerous because what it does is it tells people that when they fail, which most of us do, it's their fault and that's part of the individuals and thing. We forget that the reasons that we fail our many and myriad and lots of the marina and brought in our environment, we blame ourselves. So the book actually begins with talking about suicide and the regions that we kill ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       And you know, that sort of the model of pathway into suicide is one that says that. We said overly high expectations for ourselves and when we fail again and again and again and again, and we feel stuck in that failure, that's when the cell starts to become in a really dangerous place to combat that particular issue. Then I think the big societal way is we need to stop telling this lie that you can do anything you want to do and be anything you want to do. We cannot transform my personality. We cannot be beyonce or Michael Jordan because we decide that that's what we want to do. You know, we have, we are, we are animals. We are biologically limited and there's nothing we can do about that other than Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan and beyonce is beyonce. Yeah. So they, they have a particular biology which enables to that particular acculturation say in, on saying it, bulks and teller.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       She's crap for the first eight years of her life. She's not that well. That might make her better. She must be bloody. Absolutely. I know I'm going to do an even better record, but why is it. But like, but like I look, I understand that this idea of um, happiness through sort of self fulfillment in a very materialistic way was always just a marketing idea. But when you sort of think of the vivid images of Coca Cola and apple and these sort of glorifications of the self, you know, these ideas, if you can do what you want, you know, like is that, that idea, I think he's merely suggested so that you can fulfill it with a can of coca cola or a new iphone. But the idea of change and potentiality, I think that this I think is very, very important to people. But I suppose where it goes wrong perhaps is when it, when there's a preordained idea of what it is you're meant to be in order to be happy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       Now, speaking from personal experience, I fought, I've got loads of money and I'm famous and have sex with every one. That'd be great. So I tried those things and there were bits of it that were sensually brilliant, an egotistically rewarding. But I found them all to be ultimately our ultimately unfulfilling. And now my life is based on, you know, admittedly we've economic comfort, like I'm living in a degree, I don't have to go out and do terrible things to get money, but like at all, so like, but like uh, you know, but I do, but I'm living in a kind of an ordinary domestic sort of life or partner have trialed pets, you know what I mean? I'm not a headedness anymore. I'm not living in a decadent life because I think I was trying to live in accordance with a myth that was untrue.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       So I completely agree with that. But my concern would be if we're left with just a biomechanical model of this is your limitations as an animal and as an individual that people might settle for a life that's fulfilling. Yep. So, so yeah, so there's a nuance here. So I don't want to come, come across like I'm attacking individualism completely isn't, it's not a sort of big polemic because what you have to do as well, sort of being a grown up is take a step back and go actually individually, ms dot pretty amazing as well. Like what we've achieved in the western two and a half thousand years. It's pretty amazing. We've done some pretty amazing stuff and some bad stuff like technology in that we look at New York, we built New Orleans. Yeah. And a part of that is individually. Apart from that is that we tell people you can do anything you want to do, he should shoot for the stars, but we also have a full idea of what a human being is in our culture today.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       We, especially on the left, you know, we like to believe that the human brain is a blank slate and that we are all born in a place of equal, amazing potential. And that isn't true. We all have, we're all biological limited in different ways. So we all have different talents, different abilities. And there's a guy called Brian little, I speak to who, who's an expert in this kind of personality stuff. He talks a lot about the damage the Self Esteem Myth has wrought upon our people and you know, and he says that we need to give people kind of equals and personal projects over which, which gives them meaning but over which they have efficacy I ever wished, which they, you know, there's no point in trying to be the fastest man in the world if you are 86 and have one leg, you know, like we, we, we have to understand that, know that the capabilities of our children and encourage them in those specific directions and not say, yeah, you can be beyonce.

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       Just dream big. Yeah. These values and ideals are probably sort of erroneous and that sort of established by capitalist consumer template. These other constellation is populated body idols and icons of the capitalists. Skyscape absolutely right. It's the economy. So at the beginning of our chat and I talked about who is this? Who is this hero is surrounded by this 22 year old thin stomach, big boobed globally minded. Entrepreneurial. Yeah. Because it's a budget. I didn't know who. Who is this person with? This person is the hero of our culture, so we live in a near liberal culture, neoliberal environment, and this is the hero of neoliberalism. This is the person who is most, um, uh, cut out best to survive and thrive in the neoliberal environment. So this is the person I culture is trying to try, trying to attempt us into becoming a facsimile low.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       He's not a real, he's a, he's a myth, but actually it's sort of probably old white blokes pottery masturbating over the image you just described because that person doesn't exist. It's a cipher, not a cultural myth is a cultural construct and we're all tormented by it to a certain extent. You know, we all want to be this person. And of course as we get older and fatter, we, we become less and less to that person. And as you know, and, and that's why, you know, one of the most vulnerable groups for suicide are middle aged men. Because you know when, when you hit your forties and fifties, you've come up against these limitations very much and you begin to realize, I'm never going to be that person that I've, I've always been told that I ought to be. Yes, that's right. And your physical gestures, you did that mate, very close to the Nazi salute.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       You as you gestured that the bloke was outside and a bath and they think it's because really where we should be looking for this kind of resolution is inward. It's peaceful in our connection. Like one of the repeated reframes that I'm banging on about if that, that all of these things that like many of the discoveries that are made by the sort of world of neuroscience, which I knew next to nothing about, uh, and uh, like it was sort of in sociology and health and stuff I've already outlined in spiritual principles. And as we discussed prior to us recording, you know that many of the particularities and sociocultural aspects of religious doctrine that are particular to the time of its conception. I can see that those observances ain't particularly helpful. But the perennial ideas of oneness, that of self is realized through communion with the whole fruit or acceptance that the material is transient and temporary lessons that I've learned in my own life. I recognize we're already bloody written down in old, old 5,000 years old. The ancient texts. And when some Swami said to me in India like chillingly, the material world has nothing else to give you. Now, Russell, it can take from

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       you. And it made my stomach turn over when he said it, I knew he was telling the truth. I knew what he meant. Stop looking for it in fame. Stop looking for it in money. And on a daily basis, I forget. I wake up and I think, oh, you know, and that's why again, in the, in classical myths there is per permit us to go through the daily punishment because he stole the file. Sufis who asked to continually push the rock up the hill because it's an ongoing realization because the self is an event rather than an object. The self is the conscious awareness of our own experience, which I think can be brought into alignment with a different kind of pace if we do reject that external matrix of ideas that were supposed to be heading towards, but I wouldn't abandon the idea of a pursuit because I think that's how we can change the world with that energy

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       drive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think. I think the one thing that individualism gets wrong is, is it in over sin, over emphasizing the individual is it turns it back turns its back on on the fact that we are a tribal animal. We are, we are a connected species. We spent over 90 percent of our time on this earth as members of hunter gatherer tribes of around 148 people for thousands of years and years before thousands of thousand years before civilization go. And so how long did that go on hunter gathering? Hundreds of thousands of years. I mean the average that you tried to find that specific date for the book, but they're all wildly different. So I ended up kind of fudging a little bit. Oh No, hang on a minute. We found a big tribal people cross that ice plateau. They're always argued about that, but we. Yeah, but we have, you know, we had these tribal brains and, and, and we, as you say, we, we basically.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       This is a blip the way you said that 50 year democratic blip in ancient Greece. Like, Oh, show. I liked him, but then I must band. But he goes to site. It's just a clearing in the woods. We talk about civilization, like it's some big deal. He's like, just for while the forest is cleared back. Oh look, we've got televisions and towers and then nature will reclaim it. So for hundreds of thousands of years we were quite happy with the berries in the Huntington and the Shaman and now. Yeah. And of course I, you know, and so, so, so, so, so we kind of turn our back very much on, on, on the kind of individual on the essential connect connected part of our humanity is, as you say, well it's not in the book. That's when I was living in Australia. I did a story on him place called Rookwood cemetery outside Sydney, and it's the biggest cemetery in the southern hemisphere, so city of dead people and it's all and it's all a kind of cordoned off in terms of the culture.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       There's a Chinese cemetery in Islamic cemetery in all that stuff. That's a bit of a downer. You can't mix with the wrong group. It's very tribal. You barely meet with them lot, but it's true. You'll just be some mush as she is a good point. You know the, it goes back to our tribal cells. We are tribal, you know, even even in death, we can't skip the tribe business, but I asked the guy who kind of manages imagery as a WHO's the worst. He's the worst people for kind of tending the grays coming back and said, oh, Christians by far and away all the other cultures, you know, they keep coming back. You know, they, they, they, they polish the grave, they bring gifts and flowers. You know, some of the, some of the racist have like annual events where they come and have little parties for the greatest westerns.

Speaker 1:          00:44:44       They come once or twice and then they just discovered shit and that's individualism, you know, that's, you know, even down to the kind of the unit of the family, you know, once they did all their debt, now they're irrelevant. We much more me focused and I didn't understand that at the time I thought, why are we so bad? But now I get it. It's because we're individualists because. Yeah, right. We don't have, we don't connect to the path with NCSL linear tradition. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, the family were not, were far less family minded than those other eastern cultures. And that Tuesday I miss you grabbed that. Where did they go? Well, yeah, that's a folder. Um, say that when you were talking about Confucius and like, and, and like having a different relationship with self and selfies. Is there anything in that stuff that can be useful to us in a collective ideologies that we could somehow ransack propagate?

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       And I think one of the things that surprised you from my research was that, you know, especially on if we always talk about this kind of crazy myths they have, that there was once a better time and it was, there was once a perfect English and make America great again. But actually there was a better time in a way, and I'm not saying she, you back to that time because we can't know because it's kind of changed because of time, but, but, but the time, I was surprised to see that the middle, the middle 20th century was a time of much more quality of the code that some economists call the. It appeared, they called it the great compression causes compression between the, the, the, the, of inequality. There was much less inequality and that was this era of regulation of high taxation, of unionization.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       But it was also before globalization. So it was a kind of a simpler time. Um, but, but what, but what kind of knocked I think our, our, our kind of individually selves into that era of more collectivization was disaster. Unfortunately. It was the great depression and it was the first and second world wars, and in those periods of massive crisis knocked us into going, right? We need to start looking after each other. We can't have a world of war and economic disaster and all that stuff. So, uh, that's the thing that worries me is that it takes a bit of a disaster to kind of knock us into a collective reality. Oh No, I'm inclined. She'll tell you that what happens is we get shocked and terrified by sort of, you know, shock doctrine and she's called it low. Get all terrified. And then you act on the basis of your individual interests. And of course, like it became clear and out. Adam Kay says that the myth of a time is often contrary to its truth. So if we're told we're individuals or individuals or individuals, the reality is you are a blob of humanity. That's what said, like, we're all like, yeah, why? And about our bloody air cuts and selfies and our converse trainers, I've got these ones that are made out of nikes now. Nikes, gorgeous box, fresh going to die. Dying.

Speaker 2:          00:47:32       So I've got bit that worries me. Very bad. Imperfect I. No, no, I think about them sometimes, but it's actually basically I've just got two little worries on the end of my legs, so I'm just thinking some get some bubble gum on that burger. What if the beech root folds on the Isa? So we're thinking of ourselves as individuals, but really we're just being marketed at and we're fulfilling our NATO because most people aren't going to be a beyonce, but heroes, we're not heroes. Icons of often functioned in that way now. Like you know, you hold that aspirational object up and instead of being to express the essence of beyonce is a woman who can express her womanhood through creativity and potency, Feminine Goddess Energy. But you'll settle for or I'll buy the same headphones. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You will. Yeah, that makes sense. Of course, it's all that's used for marketing purposes and I think the other thing, the interesting thing to think about when all this is before any of this sort of engine green stuff is all that tribal stuff and the fact that the, that we are a particular kind of tribal species. Uh, you know, we liked the chimps in that we're not only groupish that we attack other groups and you see that a lot on social media. So in human tribe as in the chimp drive, the status is always changing. Who's at the top is always in kind of in flux. It cook a chimp, a troop leader will be up there for 45 years. So we, we are preoccupied with status and we see that kind of

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       that was going on in the week. We stray into anthropology a little bit when we, you and I talking because we are trying to understand it in a central truth aren't. With that goes beyond the limited and limiting context of civilization, which is only a blip, but saying the hunter gatherer tribes would have been luckily little chimp society with your only chief for a minute and then someone's trying to knock that off with a rock.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       We're in chimps. It's four to five years, which is interesting because we see that in electrocytes inhumans. Exactly. It's exactly the same. I had the banana but, but, but that's. But that's going to have social media, isn't it with you like, you know, we're constantly worried about how many likes we've got you. I'll relative status, status updates and all this stuff. But the other thing is that is that is that we are aggressively tribal like that. Like you know, our, our relatives, the chimpanzees that we kind of attack these other groups. And that's. I think that's another really sort of dangerous aspect of social media is it encourages these very ancient kind of tribal circuitry in us that when someone breaks the codes of our Ingroup, we sort of go, wants to go off and kind of tear their limbs off in a sense them attack them. But this is really ancient stuff. This is really powerful tribal circuitry in the, in the human self that thinks like, you know, these, these kind of twitter storms. Uh, kind of feeding off.

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       Tell us, well, what happened to you when you were in Scottish modern history. Tell us what happened to you when you met a nice den.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       Would the villain. Actually he was the tribal guy. So this is a really interesting guy called John Pridmore who, uh, he, he, uh, he's just a classic eastern gangster. Love Him. Yeah. He's a really interesting guy and he looks exactly like you spent lucky's about seven foot with big leather coat on and bolt head. And you sat there like with his fist down fist or with a big watch down there too, if you want him to, like you'd call that a kettle kettle. Oh crikey. But have a me baby. But he was living his life in that classic Wimpish tribridge way when he was a gangster, you know, he, he was an enforcer for a drug for the, for the drug gang, with the firm, the firms and forth. Someone didn't pay their money. I'd kick a rat in the shins. Yeah. Well he met with him.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Was it torture and beat people? Yeah. Yeah. So, so some things will be naughty, but in a gentle words to describe stuff. Show up. Yeah. Well no, they never shoot us because if you, if you had to shoot it and then you went into prison for longer. So he had a machete. Yeah. He had a special. His shirt. He had a. He had a special, especially a bespoke leather coat that had a pocket for a Jif lemon bottle with acid in it. Some sort of acid in it. Bleach. It might have been to put in your eyes and a machete and the other one we having pancakes, but then he had a massive nervous breakdown. It became Catholic faith. He found the Lord today. Lord, why was he important in your research? Because he was my example of the tribal self. So he, he, he, you know, he, he's, he, he's, he's gang was the tribe and they will go to war with the opposing tribe, which was obviously the rifle drugs took who were also trying to sell drugs in these kind of west end clubs, but also the, his nervous breakdown was really important as well because it tells us a really important thing about the self and it's the idea of the self as a storyteller.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       So there's this really interesting idea from neuroscience about called confabulation and it's this idea that we all have this voice in our heads, this kind of internal model of this constantly writing all our events. Tea, yeah, you know him. So he's saying this is why you did what you did. This is what you said, that this is why you're a good guy. This is what you should do next. But it has no access to the rest of our unconscious. So it's essentially making it up. It's just telling you this story. So, so you have no access to the real reasons why you're doing what you're doing. So it's quite terrifying concept because it's saying that we have no real idea why we do what we do, what we feel, what we feel, what we feel, but the only reason that we feel that we have like we do is because his voice is telling us and it's just making stuff up.

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       So when he had his nervous breakdown, what happened was he, he, he, he punched this guy and he thought he'd killed him and his boss, but when you put over a couple of nights off, John, because otherwise you're going to get in prison. So he went back to his flat, he started smoking a joint. You put on some porn, and then the television started talking to him and saying listing all the things he'd done. Now John was brought up in a Catholic household. And so his confabulation immediately, his explanation of music was where that voice is obviously the devil. And that means that he's telling me I'm going to go to hell. And that means that if I'm going to save myself from hell, I need to pray to God. So he runs outside, falls to his knees naked. Not Naked, unfortunately. Um, but perhaps with boner he was watching porn and then and then and then he runs and he runs to his mom's house. He knocked on his mom's door, get rid of the erection, finish this off, and his mom opens the door and he says, what you're doing job, what you do in John. He said, mom, mom, something's amazing seminar. And she said, what's that full week? Just soak up.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       And he says, mom, I've found God. And she goes, at 2:00 in the morning. It was hilarious, but that. But his confabulation was and saved him from madness was the. Actually you've not had a nervous breakdown. You're having a psychotic incident, which is what I believe happened to him that night. He, he, you know, he, he, he, he took a story from his culture which was a Catholic Christian story of what reality is and what our place in that reality is. And it kept us out. Just the secular narrative for what happens in the consciousness sounded deck chairs on titanic time and it would just sort of saying that's it. That's one way of describing it. Epiphany, the sudden revelation of essence or breakdown. I reckon in a little while ago I had one of those things, but because my. Because I like to think that my inner critic now, that Voice of confabulation, I think I've given mine access to the deep deep codes that you're one like that when you went through in that research and nodal those recording.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       So my inner voice now I think I trust that little guy also. Actually, I don't entirely trust it. I always use other people's information and data. Like I go, I'm thinking of doing this thing, and people go, oh no, that's a terrible idea. Don't do it. I've got older men further down the path than me that it was sort of tell me no, no. Russell was was a mental breakdown mate, but like my age, it's very conventional. I've understood that you sort of reboot, but you question your identity and go, hold on a minute. What the hell have I been doing? Like you just said about the suicide staff and like. So I think with your man there, it feels like, you know. Yeah. The interpretive tool was. He had the vocabulary of Christianity and we have the vocabulary of neuroscience, but essentially there was one central event and that central event was, I want to break out of the preexisting narrative and anyway, it doesn't matter does it if you term it as epiphany or breakdown as long as what happened subsequently as you stop being an eastern gangster guy around for Jif lemon of acid and the machete and start being a monk, it sounds like a cool thing is, is it's an excellent point because.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       Yes, I agree with you. It was. It was great that he didn't end up medicated in a psychiatric institute as his Mother did at one point in his life and it's also great that, you know, goes around preaching the Gospel to younger children. I love a cockney because I was thinking just that bad cockney priest. I would love a cockney priest and this is got a cottony monkey. It was really easy. Well, yeah, he's around. He's around it. It was a very odd moment when I was bothering him. I was talking to my mom and it was very, very Catholic and she said to me, now is what you've been doing? I said, oh, I'll just do. I've been. I actually interviewed a Catholic monk was trying to say something in the market entertainer. Yeah, and she's, Oh, well, what was that? I said, well, he's just a guy called John pridmore this gangster, and she went, Oh yes, I've sat next to him at mass and I was at the same place where I don't know what happened, but like it immediately sort of carry on your research a bit more with your own family.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       It was a bit. It was a bit deflating. I was jumping jump in there. That'd be deflated by that. Really. Somebody when it sounds sort of movement in the sixties, you sit around, rooting around in, archive your own mother says, I've met someone that you've been interviewing and switch off show that they have attention, will say, Gosh, you should have done a lot of that. Gang started like the sound of your book. A great dude. Now, what about that thing that I was saying at the beginning of the interview that I was playing a computer game and the bits where it's a pirate and it's very like when I'm assassin's creed and it's all the elaborate missions where I'm robbing Spanish galleons, I like it, but then when it goes back to the subplot where it reveals that you're not really Hispanic or you're not a pirate, you're a man in an office pretending to be a pirate and the Games you have to play in the office of crap like Pac man looking games.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       I get bored with them, but really you're probably on a motor neuron level doing the same thing, twiddling your thumbs about moving in different directions, but when you're being the pirate, it seems like you're smashing over the edge of a barrel when you're doing cool stuff and when you're in the office it's boring. So are we essentially just one as a kind of an experiencing entity? Consciousness itself, receiving data that you said it was like electronical impulses and organizing it into all different stories. Looking for stories that are attractive to us, either because of some personal inflection or because of the culture of our time. Validates and enjoys that story. Yeah, totally. So my last book was got the heritage and it was about exactly. This is it. It's about how we experience our lives. The story about the brain conjures this story. One neuroscientist I spoke to, Chris, Chris described us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       The illusion the brain makes makes us the, the invisible actor at the center of the world and what it does to keep us, keep us motivated to keep her as happy and kind of forward kind of moving is it creates this narrative of meaning I could call the brand the hero, my crew, but you know, it makes us this kind of hero. It creates this very simplistic story for, for us to sort of sort of living live in the middle of and the computer. Can you describe. It's quite. It's quite fascinating actually because as you describe it, when you're the pirate, the swashbuckling pirate, your life is full of meaning and your this heroic morally, you know, justified. I know you're a part. Yeah, he is a pirate, but what he's doing the little bit ambiguous because there's quite a lot of murder and bloodshed, but sense that he's theory a bit, but no, he's on a journey of discovery because there's some sub characters that go when you're going to give up this piracy and help us with our big.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       So the subtext here. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, but it's this very, again, very, very ancient Greek story of of meaning and an individual kind of going out into the world and causing great effects and then suddenly switched back into this office thing and you're just playing this boring guy moving counters. It's too close to the actual reality of what you're doing. Sat up at night playing on a playstation. You've covered generally just like smacking your honor. It's quite Meta. It's quite metta. They sang that the reality of the pirate is not your ultimate reality and it may be, but that is again, it's sort of a religious idea. Like when you say this thing that you're one's ego matrix makes you the hero of your own life. These scriptures that I'm forever banging on about never bother bloody reading, tell you, but there is no such thing as self.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       You are not the hero of your own life. You're just experiencing this data and organizing. It's a but really you all part of the whole. There is one. This is the central tenet of all eastern thinking. Separation is an illusion. You are experiencing this, but the, you are one. You are one with all phenomenon. Yeah. Well I think, I think there will be one thing I think that goes back to these confucian ideas of if you know of collectivity and it, but I think the part of that, the, the, the modern kind of scientific kind of does, does bear out is, is that, is that we are, that is this kind of illusion that we are living in this kind of the story which we live our lives in. The middle of his is his, uh, is uh, construction. I mean, what do we have?

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       What we really, really know. All we know is the information is hitting our senses and our senses experience that information is millions and millions of little electrical pulses and it uses those electrical policies like computer code to build reality that we experience is real. All the colors and shapes and patterns and sounds and it is a construction and it is a story and and it makes us feel important or meaningful like the pirate in assassin's creed, but really strip all that away and we. What are we with the guy in the office with the tiddlywinks in my tip link alone will. I've really enjoyed this. What five books should pay. Obviously we take for granted that people should read your book Selfie. What five books do think I should go and rate isn't? No, I'm going to do good in it. What the pertaining to these ideas now, right?

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       See your clever right now. Clever man will tell us five bucks to read and you've got basically your five favorite books. You reckon we should rave when we'll get out of it? Okay, cool. Okay, well there you go. Probably say sapiens off the top of my head. Where there were the, I guess the, the, the, the, the two books that are kind of essentially this is the geography of thought rigidness bit which talks about these Greek ideas. Cool. There's, um, the happiness hypothesis by an American neuroscience psychology is called Jonathan Haidt. Height h a Idt. That's cool. That height, because we don't have to be called hate, like, no, I don't want to call them haters. Let's call it kind of. It's. Got It. Hi Jonathan. Hi. The book I'm reading reading at the moment, which I love the people of the rbs by Jack London. If you read the people at the rbs by Jack London.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Now people. Yeah. So he say so it's an amazing book. Wrote White Fang. Yeah, exactly. So what he did, he wrote a nonfiction book and I think it was 19. Oh, two where he went in, he saw the east end of London has this amazingly dangerous wild place, which it was. And he dressed up as a poor person and went into an adventure into who's playing computer games in real life. Yeah. But it's amazing. It's an amazing book and it's really like some of those old books are very difficult to read, but it's really almost three of your golf football, potato. He goes into a secondhand clothes shop and get us all the garb and gets dressed up and stuff and you know, you talked about getting into that. What's that famous is it cooks the map shops still there in covent garden where all the adventure is used to go and get their maps of darkest Africa and he said I'm going to journey into the east end of London. And they went, well we can't help you with that. That's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       So that's a really work of nonfiction, which I didn't think sort of people kind of know the bitch about the people of the abyss and its description of what these standards like in those days. It's just extraordinary. That edit and I'm sorta. Could I have a yard a please fucking fuck. Who are deaf with my boner. Sorry. I tried to spend together too many friends at the swearing. So. Well what's the next one? We've done free done three. Oh, what else can I talk about? I can talk about, um, a Star Zealand bat and a funder that's one of my favorite nonfiction books. Woo. Sealand nothing book. Yeah. So she goes out into East Germany and discoveries about the, about the study, but I guess the book, my favorite book, the maybe you want to be a nonfiction writer is a book called bad wisdom by a bill drummond x off the care and Mark Manning of Zodiac mind open the love reaction and, and so, but back in the wisdom yet it's an amazing travel log that they decided to try and save the world by driving to the North Pole and a Ford escort and putting an icon of Elvis Presley on it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       And it's there kind of in. It's their story of them doing that. And it's um, the first, the first line is I am shit scared, shit, scared of almost everything and never opened that book going. Got, this book's going to be amazing. And it is, it's an amazing book. I've even got his tattoo on my shoulder, Zodiac mind, there's a line that he says in the book they're afraid. So we are Zen masters and we know what the fuck we're talking about. One triangle thing is the zed is not a very good tattoo in the middle. So actual actual zed as superman. When I was a boy, right as superman, I used to see the yellow bear, not the red bit, but I'd never knew until I was old. That was a red s in the middle of his chest. Those to try and when I draw and draw that logo, I draw the yellow bits. I have knowing that there was a red x in the middle. I had to sleep man wallpaper. Exactly the same thing. The yellow what? Those yellow light shapes like whales because it's an s in the middle. Yeah. That's a nice. We were looking at the wrong color wheel. We wasted.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       We're wasting our lives. Garrett just did a Benny Hill blue there, which really brought me back to myself. All right, thanks man. That's really cool. Effects for those books. Thanks for your time. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. That was under the skin with Russell brand. If you like that podcast, give us five stars on itunes. Is sponsored by me Russell Brand and my rebirth to if you want to get Gary Russell brand.com or give us a kind of. Oh, that was so good. Thank you.
