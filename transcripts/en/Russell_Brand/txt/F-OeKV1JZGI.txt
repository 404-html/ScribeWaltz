Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Do you feel ready? You believe in God? I believe in God with often they don't really know. I mean like we are supported by invisible forces. That kind.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       I love that video about your, uh, your grandfather. You obviously love him. He said maybe. What is he still the most important male figure in your life?

Speaker 1:          00:00:23       Yeah. Yeah. He's probably the only important male figure of my life, which is a strong statement to make, but that's about right.

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       Do you have a good female figures in your life?

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       Women. I try. I try to be that um, you know, I come from a very sort of broken crazy family.

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       Okay. I heard that sort of known of your uncles had been incarcerated. So you come from a family where the crime is part of the story.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Yeah. I mean they're not nine of them, but five of the nine of them all spend some time in prison and that sort of trickled down and I have cousins that have spent time in prison and it was just a part of my story growing up and it wasn't particularly unique. It's so it's a weird thing to say, but in the retrospect like that seems normal to me, like we're going to go see your uncle in prison. Okay, sure. That's what you do normal for a lot of people. It's not extraordinary. Yeah. Which really lets you know that you can create different simulations and different pockets of society and until you travel outside of it to have a different experience. You think it's just the norm.

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       When did that happen for you? When did your life transition from? What was your early determining context to what was the thing that should change first few candies?

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Well, I think I was always sort of an alien child. Like my mother says all the time when I was a kid, they were just weirded out by me. Like I never cried. They always thought I could like understand them as a baby in the crib, which is really bizarre. But the earliest thing that I remember was the first play date, which was in kindergarten class. I was five years old and there was a girl named Lindsey to. She was this blonde girl with blue eyes and we became fast friends. I don't, I don't think we had reading class together and her mother invited me over for a play date and I went to her house and I was just shocked that people lived in the way that she lived. She lived in the suburbs. She had a massive house. She had this Victorian concept room.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       She had a nanny, she had a playroom and I was. I just remember being shocked that this was even a part of life because prior to obviously I existed within the realm of my family. I lived in a really small apartment. Me and my two sisters shared a room in a low income housing a building and it just blew my mind. So I think when I was a really small kid I was already considering like, how is this asking the question at least which is important in order to get the answer. How could people be living such different lives and you either take two approaches to it. You either say, I hate rich people because they live that way, or I want to become a rich person and learn how to live that way. I think I've always been curious about success and wanted to learn how to be successful myself, so my path was somewhat natural in that regard.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       I never, I never hated rich people. It's a very weird thing to me that people demonize the rich. No, I think he hates a terrible emotion because it, it, it, it's, you harvest it internally, so if you hate someone you hate that they're okay. They don't, they don't feel that. So you always been an aspirational even when you were a child. If it sounds to me from what little you've told me already that you sounds like you had an unusual emotional state, that you were sort of quite an independent person. Yes. And that you're. I mean, even watching you, I've watched quite a lot of your videos and the interviews. You're very powerful person. You've got driven on you. You've got a strong presence. Yeah, and I've always had that, like my teachers hated me growing up because I was just extremely assertive. I think think about the functional educated.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       That's a very good question. I think I like to say that I was self educated because you don't learn anything in school. You learn propaganda, you learn how to function in society and the way that the government and society wants you to function. Um, so I like to think that because I always had to earn my way through life. My parents couldn't afford to put me through school. My parents started paying for anything for me. Um, when I turned 14 years old I was kicked out of my house and I was living with a boyfriend for six months. I was one of those kids, you know, um, and so I, I sort of was self taught and I was constantly pushing back against arbitrary authority. Arbitrary Authority mean that because I'm the teacher and I say, go left, go left. Well, no, tell me why I should go left.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       I need to like to be a little bit, a little bit of reasoning behind this. Um, I was always a critical thinker my entire life, um, and that sort of, I, but I didn't go to, I went to university for a couple of years and then dropped out. So I think I'm so smart because I didn't go to university and do that thing where you said that your auto didact self educated person, what was your reading? Oh, okay. So I, when I was a small kid, I loved books. I would get totally lost in novels and it was a lot of fiction novels that I grew up on. I was reading books, very bizarre. I mean to be like a five year old reading, uh, an eight year old reading Nora Roberts and like Dean Koontz and I just, I love to get wrapped up in fiction novels.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Uh, so that helped obviously in terms of just my vocabulary and ability to communicate. I was always reading. I was a big reader or total dweeb. I'm at home. I was cool in school, but it was a total dweeb at home. Uh, and I remember racing even when I was in fifth grade to read the Harry Potter books, like one of those people that was in line waiting for them. She's a disaster now, by the way, but issue, I mean her books are very good. I'm a politically, she a total disaster. She should stick to fiction because she doesn't understand reality. She doesn't, she really does. And I'm sorry. She's wonderful worlds she created though. People just get lost inside of, um, but yeah, I didn't start reading political chat and you're fine. Get, get comfortable. We're going to be in here for, you know, comfortable. They're not leaving until we agree on absolutely everything. I have you in a mega hats. I'm wearing it already, but just very nice. Nice. So yeah, I dunno, I didn't start reading I guess non fiction until I got interested in nonfiction and politics and things of that nature. And then I started reading Milton Friedman and Dr Thomas Soul. Ooh. I haven't understood it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       Any of these references, like even those fictional ones was reading when you're a kid. Now, will these Milton, these modern wars,

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       the recent ones, you know, Milton Friedman, the economists and Dr Thomas Soul is also an economist. Um, and, but he, he's a, he's a black economist, which was the most important reading that I could've done because he just completely makes you understand that people are using and manipulating you, uh, because of the color of your skin. And he just uses fact based logic and reasons and world history. And we'll bring you backward and forward and show you a basic theses like, um, they make you think that because you're a minority, that means that you're behind. And that's the history of the world. Tells us that's not true, you know, and the Ottoman Empire, uh, the Greeks owned the bank, so it was a Turkish empire, the Greek zone, the banks. And we're doing the best in that economy. So he just goes through, um, world history and just shows you pretty much all of the fallacies and all of the emotional arguments that are made and basically tells you if you want to get ahead in life and start from nothing, you have to abandon these arguments is emotional arguments and understand the facts and how it is that you can start behind and get ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       And that's what I chose to do.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Do you think there were certain philosophical ideas that may have a truth to them when practiced on the level of the individual, but when translated to a social scale become more complex and break down a deal? Oh sure. Socialism, because it's Utopian because it takes it about individualism and self [inaudible]. Like what, what, what? When, what? I feel kindness is your powerful person. You're driven, you've come from nothing and you've achieved a lot in your life and it feels to me at least not to suggest this to you because you've not directly said this or I'm actually. I think you maybe have directly say stuff like, well, if I can do this, you should do it. Like now. But that kind of for me is to deny your unique abilities and your unique qualities. Even having drive the willingness

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       to work hard is in itself an endowment. It's why don't say you can do what I've done. Right? I don't say that you're going to follow everything that I've done. I actually hope that my kids never had to live through, you know, or see the things that I had to see growing up. Why would I want that? I don't think people should. I mean just, I don't want my children to, to go see their uncle's in prison or to struggle financially and not to be able to afford to go on a school trip. I don't think that that's a necessary thing for you to understand how to become successful. Um, but what I do demand is that people abandoned a victim mentality, right? I think that that is, has become a cancer in our society to Mintel. Give me, give us some background on it because some people won't know what you mean.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       It's just the oppression. Olympics, you know, everybody wants to say I deserve more because I'm more oppressed than you. Oh, okay, well you might say, I might say that I'm more pressed than you because I'm black and you're white, so instantly I'm more pressed and I deserve more than my voice should be louder. And then we say, okay, well you're a male and I'm a, I'm a woman, so instantly I deserve even more because I'm a woman and you're a male and women are more oppressed, which is totally a lie. Um, and I should have my voice heard louder and then you keep going gay, straight and they've created all of these little, these little pockets and you have to figure out who is the most depressed person. I guess it would be a disabled black female gay person would probably be the most. If you want to win the oppression Olympics, that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       And everyone should fawn over you and everything you say should count and should matter. And it's, it's absolute crap. The victim mentality is what's stopping most people from getting from point a to point b should be mean. But if I imagine a guy disabled and if you are gay, disable a black female female, if I imagine that person, I don't like it and I'm sure there's even within that category, I'm sure there's lots of lots of and lots of variety. But when I think of the most powerful people in the world and the people who have the most influence, not many of them are gay, disabled, black females. So I felt, well I'm not a by the way a kind of, you know, just so you know, where we're starting from. I feel like the difference between MSNBC and Breitbart and trump and Obama is so small as to be irrelevant for my political standpoint.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       These are what I would call the system. Right? I suppose what I'm trying to illustrate, candice, is that it's relative for me. None of those people are offering the kind of social change that's required to create the systems that human beings deserve. Now like so what is yours to me is that you have a tremendous faith in the ability of the individual to create their own destiny. Why wouldn't you? Because you've lived it, but do you think that that's applicable to all individuals? I think 100 percent if it, unless there are of course policies in place that are preventing you from doing that. There are not in America at this moment in time. So they actually were forming our own oppression by buying into the idea of oppression. Um, you know, one of the things that harmed the black community the most or these last six years has been the welfare state.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       That's what's happening in France right now. It doesn't work. It doesn't. Giving handouts and creating a giant government and not creating a, you know, incentives for people work, which is what people want to do. It's the human spirit that governments don't seem to understand that policies that are socialists don't seem to understand. They don't account for the human spirit. We want to be valuable. We want to create. Um, so when you remove all of that, you end up with people that are oppressed and with a variety of problems and you can pick a ton of problems within the black community that I'm trying to reverse. It all starts with abandoning the victim mentality and the government tells me that I should feel bad for myself for being a, a woman and being black and make me understand that I'm behind in society. You know, those are the racists.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Don't tell me that I need to feel bad about myself. I don't feel that way and they sit and they insist that you do so. The greatest challenge and and also the most fun I think that I have on these college campuses, is that you want to see if a black person, you want to see who the real racists are. Tell you. Tell people that as a black person you don't see yourself as a victim. They lose their goddamn minds. That's why they hate me. Read the articles about me. They call me a neo Nazi. I mean the Guardian, right? Neo Nazi, a supporter of white supremacy because I believe that I can do whatever I want in my life because I have confidence. What does that tell you? That they're rushing to smear me because I believe that black people can do it without government handouts. It means that they insist that black people do it with government handouts. Otherwise they'd say, all right, she has a perspective. I don't make any policies. I'm not in the government. I'm not running for office. Why does it bother them so much? Right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       Me, like I feel you, but what I'm saying, it's just like, where is compassion and love in your philosophy? Where is the place for that?

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Uh, well, what do you mean? If somebody, compassion to me is not telling people that they should be coddled because of the color of their skin. I think that that's, that's,

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       I've seen that over and like a button. This is what will, let me tell you this. I've thought like say my background doesn't sound nearly as challenging as your call from him prior to celebrity, which I'm imagining there anything you want to know about me, but the prior to that, like I grew up in an ordinary household, single parent family. My mom was sick a lot when I was a kid. I had have intermittent access with my bad, you know, relatively regular. But like that, my parents weren't together and then I became a crack and heroin addict when I was sort of in my late teens and I feel that there are what I want to say, like I feel that there were social factors there. I think if I was from a different background, had access to different resources that I may have received. Psychological, spiritual input, different points now like I'm not complaining about my life. I've got money and got good family and stuff and I'm really, really happy. But I think to deny social factors in the cultivation of the individual really plays into the hands of the already. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       Before. Oh, but I don't, I actually don't deny those social factors. I tell people at the biggest problem facing the black community as father absence. But that's being incentivized by our government. So the blue, the black single motherhood rate was 23 percent in 19 sixties before welfare programs were implemented today at 74 percent in the black community. That's because they literally will give a black mother more money from the government if the father doesn't live in the home. I'm actually really, I really believe in a two parent home, but you can just look at the statistics to see that children are better off when they have two parents. But think about what's perpetuated in our media. Think about radicalize feminism. We can do it without men. F meant we hate men. That's why I fight these concepts because what you're talking about is true. That's not what people are talking about, the political realm.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       They want to get rid of all of that in favor of more government, more government, more government. It's, it's become increasingly radicalized and it's harming the individual and their chances when you come from a two parent home versus a single parent. Uh, there are, there are tons of statistics that prove that what you're saying is right. But my compassion towards that is when I go and I combat feminism right when I go and I were a hymn to shirt to the Brett Kavanaugh, um, hearings and tobacco because I don't believe in the me too movement, right? I think it's been radicalized. I think that it's, it's, it's a harmful feminism. I don't even like calling it feminism because it's, it's just a means for people to secure power, um, and it's cloaked as feminism and that's, that's how I exercise compassionate exercise, compassion. When I go fight for the first step backs and I understand that many people that are in prison are in prison because they grew up in that environment where they didn't have any parents raising them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       My mother grew up in group homes, um, and didn't graduate high school. She didn't end up in prison, but she could have very well could have. And so will you exercise compassion by having those conversations? Those are the conversations that are being had at the political level or even remote accessing compassionate. I think that was exercising analysis, critical thought and the intellect, which I would never challenge you on. Your obviously very adept and very strong in each of those areas. Let me, let's go into different territory for a moment. Am I right in thinking that you suffered from anorexia? That's correct. Younger? Yes. I suffered from anorexia for about four years. Wow. That's pretty serious. How's your eating now? I can't stop eating, so probably me, what the next year was like. Well, what's interesting is that, and you're an interesting person to talk to you about this because there is a spiritual component of Anorexia when, when there is, when, when, when you start, when you starve the body, the mind.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       That's why people do this, these fastings and many religions, when you, when you starve the body, there's almost a mental clarity that takes over. And that's what I think becomes addicting for most people. Like for me was never about weight. And for most people it's not about weight. Um, it's usually, I mean, when you learn about in Iraq, so they tell you that it's usually a manifestation of people trying to assert control over their lives. And that's what it is. It's the one thing you can control when you feel like there's chaos is what you put in your mouth and your body. Um, so that was for me, after going through a unique situation and feeling that my whole life was out of control, I just manifested as an eating disorder. And I had it for four years on and off. But like, you know, if you saw pictures, I mean I was like 30 pounds skinnier, maybe even 40 pounds skinnier than I am now, which is insane if you get any help.

Speaker 1:          00:17:48       No, I helped myself, which is crazy. Right? But I mean, what was I going to go, go, go talk to. I'm a smart person. So I think it's, it's harder. And I don't know this I'm saying this as a thought, you know, Jordan peers don't have to tell me if I'm right or wrong. He's the one that's got the, the doctorate for this stuff. But I think that it's really hard for people that have a higher Iq to go get help. We're not the a one time that I went to a therapist, it was with my parents, my parents side, they're going to try therapy. The woman was just, she was just a total moron. I mean literally everything that she was trying to say to me, my family wasn't helpful and I think that me feeling like I didn't find someone that was smart in the chair probably sort of turned me off. But if I had sat down with Dr Jordan Peterson first, I probably would be like, yeah, therapy is great. Uh, but no, I didn't, I, I just got better.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       The therapy was ineffective because you've found the therapist intellectually and analytically inept, but you can't just breeze into. I just got better because anorexia that very, very serious mental condition and I've got friends that are suffering with that and it's like almost I'm a drug addict, a recovering drug addict. Like my own experience with addiction is, is precisely that. It's trying to deal with a deficit. No, my belief is that it's a spiritual deficit or lack of connection in a dissatisfaction with the material world and inability to allied into systems that seem erroneous, duplicitous, meaningless, and are powerful. Need for some values, some spirit now, like we're not like, I feel like perhaps there's a comparable. The addiction is underscored by, I want to say some certain universal's, whether it's an eating disorder, sexual obsessions or, or, you know, like obviously drug addiction. Um, what I'm curious about is how that would be resolved, how that would end with that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       Identify the issue. And what caused me to illustrator, I actually realized that I went through this experience in high school that was classified as a hate crime. What was that? It was a racist lands. Well, I don't consider them racist. I think that that was part of the reason that I caused an eating disorder, but they left me racist voicemails and then it became the sore. But I don't consider that. But that is. Does that make an individual but individual racist? That's the question. Can you do something without having to carry a label for the rest of your life? Can you say something off pudding, which I'm sure you've done many times or right. Does that make homophobic, does that make you a racist, that make you a sexist? Can you do an app without having to carry a label for the rest of your life? Okay. So I'm not actually that. That's my point. So just for this situation, there's no forgiveness. How are we going to them? That was my problem. So this, the. They did something. It was remarkably stupid. We were a nice tool.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       They left racist voice. So they said, well, I don't think I can say those words on here, but you can name words your way through it. Okay, so like a dirty word, a feather, that dirty and word. We're gonna. Put a bullet in the back of your head like Martin Luther King. Right? Terrible stuff. I brought up a lot of African Americans, but why did they do that? Right? Nobody cares about the why. They just want to rush and call people racist. Okay, I'm still adjusting and here's how I got through my name's sorter. So this thing gets happened to, gets taken out of control. It gets blown up. It's on the front page of a newspaper and suddenly people are discussing you and I, I'm a, I'm in high school. I'm 17 years old. It's what people want. It didn't want that to be, you know, my high school story, especially getting ready to go to school.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       And your personal experience with reappropriate it and told back to you that you used as an object in someone else's narrative. That's exactly correct. And, and then now called the victim. Terrible racism before you experienced really bad. I'm going to challenge you and I'm going to challenge you on on the list. I'm going to challenge you on that. Have happened from there. I'm going to challenge you on that already. So you say that's terrible. Racism that I experienced. Okay. Or, or a couple of high school kids for. There were four kids in that car. One of them I knew, three had never laid eyes on me and never even seen me. The the, the youngest person in the car was 14. Are Really gonna label a 14 year old racist for the rest of their life. I mean this is insane, but of course it sells.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       Newspapers write this terrible thing happened in our town and people suddenly are invested in and moms are suburban moms or writing letters to the editor and everyone's like, you know, in this because nothing happens and now they have something that's happened and the media took what should have been a teaching moment for children. Okay. Why'd they do it? Well, maybe they had their first beer. One guy in the car is upset with me because I stopped hanging out with him. Was I got my first boyfriend, he said we're going to call her and leave her a voicemail and she's black. Okay. You gave a drunk drunk 14 year olds a phone. By the way, there's no emotional connection. Nobody ever talks about technology and how easy it is to be mean now. Right? You can't do that to my face or they have called me those things to my face. No, of course not. It's hard to be mean in person, but leaving a voicemail, I'll say anything to this cup. Right? This is Russell brand. I'll say anything goes God Damn Cup into the Russell brand.

Speaker 3:          00:23:01       Okay. But this is what I'm saying. So people don't even consider that. We were the first generation that had facebook, instagram, and I think, uh, it's not pronouncing instagram. It's a strange website. Instagram, instagram, instagram. Someone on a penny farthing bicycle guard passed onto. Sounds better that way we should be calling it instagram on the emphasis on the last syllable of instagram. I'm coming with you on that journey now. It seems to me that that was a traumatic incident and your response to it was nrx here. Yeah, which free to me, but I think it's admirable that you're willing to be forgiving of the perpetrators of that, you know, because they, admittedly we're kids, but I don't think that, that there's a few things that I think and also agree with you

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       that the media capitalize on certain types of hysterical and like a short kind of hysterical attitude because it sells, you know, I don't think there is a genuine. Oh No, we're actually really shocked. At least racism happen. How can we in the, I don't mean that the energy that moves papers around or no, I would agree with you on that as well. But uh, but the fact that your being forgiving of that incident and willing to let go of that incident doesn't negate for me the fact that the particular language they used may have been socially resourced. I just want to ask you about some things that ever happened to me the other day. I was like, uh, like there's a English black footballer called Raheem Sterling. Bloody good football actually soccer player in your language. And like, uh, someone called him a Eva Manc see unt black.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       See unt, so like, uh, he's pissed off about it. Raheem Sterling got. Yeah, yeah. That guy. Yeah. The guy lost his job, like uh, you know, we can discuss that aspect of it in a minute. But like what I was like in Raheem Sterling, like instagrammed, I instagrammed instagram. Instagram's a post saying like, here's two stories. One is about like a black footballer by and his Mama House once about White Footballer bind his Mama House and the one about the white football, it's like lovely young white football up by his mom house. And the one about the black football a by, at his momma house is flash little bastard buys mom house, right? It's like I'm Raheem Sterling Brilliantly like sort of selects these two stories about the same subject and notes how one is rendered as a kind of like negatively and one is rendered positively. Stanley says that this is racially motivated now.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       Like I don't think I need beer. A black person to say yeah. That for me aligns with the way that the media functions in perpetuating certain narratives. And whilst you say the perpetuation of the victim narrative is disempowering African Americans or perhaps even black people were white, I'm not fully sure of how, uh, the breadth of your philosophy, I think it is a, um, what I want to say, a myopic to suggest that the powerful cultural narratives and historic oppression don't play a part in people's current economic poverty. Whilst the way out of that I would accept except would be into a individual culpability and individual will. Not everyone has that. Not everyone has that. Everyone has that drive, that power. Some people need support now with the role of the state and the veracity of the state's intentions are certainly things I question as well. Do I think that the Democrat Party or super kind, wonderful people? Well, we have a look at the last 20 years. How did that work out? How was, how were African Americans treated under Barack Obama? Like, so we've got the evidence that date is in. It's neither party worked particularly well, but for me to deny that there is an impact of social,

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       economic and historic conditions on the individual experience of paypal. And that, that those conditions are not affected by race for me. I don't think that's true. Well, first off, I want to go to your two articles because you use the word myopic. Okay? You, you used a sample sale, a sample of two articles to come up with this great conclusion is every single room, I understand that as every single article about a black person buying a house negative or did you find one that wasn't going to do a comparison? Now hold on. Every single article of a white person buying a house positive or did you find article of white person positive and now you've used as to say at this means that every single white person and article articles written about is true or false. I have a problem with this data set and this is what we see over and over again.

Speaker 4:          00:27:27       It's the same thing that they do and they extract the 16 unarmed black men that are shot and killed by police officers every year. Forget to mention that there's a higher rate for white people. You did the exact same thing that I can't stand. This was actually, I found, I found two articles at universal. I'm Russell brand calm down because firstly it was rocking sterling faster. That counts for times that by a thousand. No, hold on. What I'm saying is is you get a number and you can blow him out because he's probably better with media creates simulation one side by side and now it's universal truth here on the Russell brands. Listen to me for a second please. What I'm saying is is that whilst of course all of us can construct narratives by selecting information that supports our idea, Raheem Sterling didn't do this in a bit on the Saturday.

Speaker 4:          00:28:20       Someone screams racial abuse him on the next day. He goes, oh look, I'm not surprised because you know, because I experienced a lot of this treatment at a subtler level in the white arm. How did in the press, this is he's personal experienced that Ryan is recounting and then we look at the rest of the information and say, oh, what does it seem to be like for young black men in England is are there any commonalities economically? Are there any judicial or criminal issues where there's a commonality? It's not just that these narratives being cherry picked, there is also the date of receipt on incarceration of young black men in America because we are disproportionately commit crimes in America. Are we not supposed to be arrested because we're all doing the same thing. They're counted your. You're extracting that, but if they do it without saying, well, what are the economic conditions in America, but now we're missing this.

Speaker 4:          00:29:11       You're missing this. I agree that we have been, that we are. We are economically depressed as black Americans. What I'm talking about, what we disagree on is the solution. Okay, well, economically depressed because we bought into the myth that government is going to fix our problems. We have disproportionately been voting for Democrats for the last 60 years. Okay, so all of our problems are because Latin American Emma's proportionately welfare programs, we disproportionately might disagree on the solution. Well, well we're. I guess we're not moment. That's right. So I guess this one, we're not disagreeing. You're saying that I'm, I'm ignoring the fact

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       that there have been economically depressed and the economical depression then leads to higher crime rates. I agree with all of that. Okay. What we disagree on or perhaps what people disagree with me on a lot are the solutions for it. Okay, and I point out the fact of how we got here. If you don't understand how we got here in terms of buying into the idea that the government was gonna fix everything, this victim mentality it is, and they've been able to sell the easiest person to sell social. Some too. As a wealthy person a go to Hollywood, they're, they're like the number one socialist because they felt guilty about it's true. No, no, but because they feel guilty about their wealth, you, you are the perfect stereotype of somebody that I could get to grow government with Russell. Look at these poor people. Look at how well you live.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       Look at this podcast studio. Don't you feel bad as a white, straight male that all of this is going on? Oh, of course. Yes. What should I do? Use your platform to tell people that this is wrong and that you, you become the voice that actually allows people to grow government. And what it does is it decreases opportunities for black Americans opportunities with me. That's your normal argument of normal people. You're going to have to. I'm actually just having prefer that smiling. Start using that. There's some rules, right? You got me all fired up because I'm not. I'm like, I'm not a liberal. I'm, if anything, I'm an east coast into cluster. I agree with you. Yeah, the centralized government. But where, where I feel you and I are gonna disagree is on the level of extending compassion to give out hugs. Well, what do you mean?

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       How would you, how would you, how would you learn it? Ultimately you order. How would you give up? But like, uh, but I also want to ask you, uh, like when your, what is your solution? If we both agree that the sort of centrist left and you can't call those people come in and you really can't. Like there's. So there's, the difference between them is kind of negligible between wow, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is negligible in terms of like a holistic global philosophy to inculcate and spread real meaningful change. All right. Uh, so, so what, but you as a conservative, a believer in conservatism, what is the solution? We weren't limited government. We want free markets and in a society where people can help. We've had that. We've got that now mania. First off it is working in America. This is why this is the lowest rate ever for black unemployment is right now in a Donald Trump who is allegedly the most racist president. If you read the Guardian, right? Like he's so racist. That's so racist. While he sucks at racism because black Americans are doing so much better, there's been a 400 percent increase in black owned businesses because there's opportunities. He's, he's making sure that there are actually opportunities.

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       Do I believe in them? Yeah. Those sort of figures when people. Yeah. When governments go and we found out that the unemployment note after Scott, let me tell you, let they go 400 percent growth in black businesses. You know, there'll be some state in state sponsored initiative where you can start your own business. Some bullshit thing. Know that you can't trust them if you don't. Hey, like do you know what? Like if you'd like a don't believe in the Democrat Pie, how can you believe in the Republican Party differences? Anybody ever heard me say vote Republican? I don't know. It doesn't have it. Yeah. I mean I'm an. I'm independent. Okay. So I, I vote based on the candidate and the candidate that I believe in is Donald Trump. And let me tell you, he's neither Republican or Democrat, which was so interesting to watch you on the view.

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       Let me tell you why, because I've watched you before. I used to watch your youtube channels before I even was conservative. I used to watch all of your thoughts and I was like, yeah, this guy's really smart. He's really got it. You understand the problem with the establishment and. But what you didn't realize was that trump was antiestablishment because you know why you get fooled by wealth. You think wealth automatically makes you establishment doesn't obviously he's on establishment or you wouldn't have the entire mainstream media on two parties that were opposing him. He was the antithesis of all of that. And he came and he slammed all of it. Any one. So I'm a trump supporter and if people call that trump lickin's like a portion of the Republican party, because he had to run on either one ticket or the other. He ran as a Republican. Trump is by no means he calls it the swamp for a reason.

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       Do you think that the truly that the establishment is opposed to trump? I don't like that. That media noise and static and Shamash I, I agree with you. I read the stuff about him, but he is the president of United States. And what do you really think he would do for vulnerable ordinary people? And do you not think that a certain, like the commercial and capitalist society does create huge hierarchies and pyramids that lead most people? Not most people. A significant percentage of the population to not have access to sufficient resources and create systems that are run.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       No, it's not. If if you're saying to me that because some person is less driven than me, I was able to accomplish more and I was rewarded for it. That's unfair. No, that's not unfair. As long as we are provided the same opportunities which in America our system is. If you work hard and you're willing to work hard, you will be rewarded by system because some people do. Capitalism is an economic model that lifts people out of poverty. Socialism does it. It's killed 100 million people in the last 100 years. Post capitalism like that. After they bowed out. Capitalism like just 10 years ago, capitalism about the biggest lump of communism in history. Lucky it just was completely state sponsored. The whole things artificially inflate your system surviving by the merits that espouses survival. You're talking about, if we're talking about it in 2008, if we're talking about corruption and bail, I don't think they should have been bailed out.

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       So yeah, so I. I agree with that. Yeah. One hundred percent agree with you. That's exactly right, because that's not true. Capitalism, that, that wasn't true should have happened there. They should have let them go under. I believe the market. We've all wasted. A lot of the people that paid for that. Baylor had their houses reclaim the have had their houses foreclosed, won't get to be angry. You won't get an argument from me. Do you think that Donald Trump's going to address that? We're going to. Goldman Sachs was shutting down banks. We've given these people, but unfortunately he wasn't the president have seen now. And do you think he's not going to get hit and run on that? He, he, but what he is going to do with philosophy, philosophies basically in alignment with capitalism is what we're talking about. And that's something that I'm fully against. You know, so, um, but I'm talking about your says an economic model of capitalism is the only proven model that lifts people out of poverty, which is why I agree with that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       But that was about when the banks food. That's terrible. Terrible. Capitalism doesn't do that. Yes it does. That's why. Why do you think America is America? What made America America? What you talking about when you say America, do you think there is one thing called America underneath a flag, like we're like UPI a. This is America, the America of poor prenatal. There's the America of rich people. There's all sorts of American sorts of experience of American America. It is proven that if you make good choices, if you stay out of trouble, if you don't have children out of wedlock and you have a job, you will moral code. That's it and you'll be successful. That's it. That's all you have to do, but in the interim, you're in a part of a school system that sells you a thousand ways that you're being victimized and people as opposed to going into work are wearing pussy hats and protesting a fair and reelection.

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       I do agree those aspects of the education system, they're hugely disempower aganda. Fair enough. Like disempowering to ordinary people. I think we do disagree on some of the solutions. Now see, imagine this like you when you were like 14. You've got the Anorexia and you don't. You can't get therapeutic help because you're too bloody clever. What do we do in the instance of a, a, a, a woman or go that suffering from anorexia and it doesn't have your drive. What happens in this situation? This is a person. Wouldn't you agree that requires help, compassion, love, support, and who do you propose should provide to that? Hopefully her parents. What if her parents, what do you think the government's going to just create programs for anorexics to go to places. I mean if, if an anorexic seeks help, six therapeutical help and they have to go so bad.

Speaker 3:          00:37:55       If the government did that, to me, it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous idea, but it just depends on bailing out banks. Why can't we bail out some anorexia? Not Bailing out the banks. The government is not God. They are not the solution to all your problems. Families, the community, your friends, things of that nature. People forgot about that whole thing. That happens, right? Where like, where's the girl going to go? Does she have parents? Is there anyone before you start worshiping the government to fix it? What am I going to do? I don't have any money in my account. Is there a government program that will fix it? What am I going to do? I have anorexia is Erica. This is what's wrong with the world. People don't remember light before government was.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       I'm astonished by is your belief that the government is. He's so friendly. Benevolence, go to one that wants to know. I don't believe in that machine. Empowering conditioning. You want to grow it. You don't walk around with their binders and they'll do inspection. Seriously. You agree with that? I thought, that's not my thing. I don't have polished anorexic programs for government. We just created from a list. We're touching. Taxis are going up considerably for my cuddly, cozy anorexia program and we need a further 10 percent for little putting them pie truck epics shut down in the dumps. Heroin all day, but this used to be a thing communities used to not think. This individualistic culture is in itself. Destroying the principles are spiritual human level of community. Do you not think when people see this economic inequality, this disparity? I'm not talking about height in your little rich friend, Lola, Belle or wherever it was.

Speaker 4:          00:39:43       You went round and see her nanny and what infuriated by but for, oh well, maybe one day I'll have my own nanny. Do you not think that economic inequality creates in a human being a sense of injustice, of unfairness? Because people. Do you know what Kandis that 90 percent of people that are rich, do you know why they're rich? They was born rich. You're going to tell you something. I think that economic disparity creates that feeling, but at a fundamental understanding of economics can tell you know that most people that are rich are born rich. He's not like there's a tiny minority of people that are like you that come from a poor background and managed to overcome it, and this is what's a pro I problem. I've noticed with a lot of great people is they've sort of belief that their greatness is something that can be replicated and I don't think it can.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       I see, so I believe in the individual you don't believe are differences, but the primary goal of the individual should be to serve the community. I, I do not believe that the primary goal of individual fields, so you're, you're just, you're just counting the human spirit. Now I'm saying that's all there is. Let me ask you a quick no, there's not in a humanity. Think of animals in the wild. Even have to go to humanity. We can just think about animals in the wild. What is our human instinct? Okay? Are you going to make sure that everyone on this block is fed? Before you feed yourself? Do you go around and say, Hey, have you had breakfast this morning at breakfast this morning? Hey, how are you going to make sure you're. And if you have any, if you have an excess, of course you're going to do the humans.

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       Human condition in our incentives are going to be to want to help you mold tool one of the richest, the 15 people on the planet have got as much cumulative welfare's, the poorest $5 million, but your glass. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Excuse me. First and foremost, you're talking about literally point zero, zero, zero, zero. One percent of the world is what I'm talking about. Okay, and what are they preaching? What do they want? Socialism so that nobody else has the opportunity to become what they've become. They're are the ones that are pushing.

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       Are you kidding? George Soros doesn't want socialist policies. Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, doesn't want socialist policies. They want to make sure that no one else has the opportunity to get to language because what we do, here's what my socialism looks like, tight Jeff Bezos as well from him, except for a reasonable stipend for him to live on something that you can have 10 million a year or something, tax Amazon to the ground so that. So, so the rich people pay for 85 percent of all of the taxes. You think they should pay for even more? That's that's fact. That's fact. Yes. Don't tell that's a fact. The top 10 percent pay for 85 percent of all the taxes. When people say they're going to raise their taxes more, I'm just like, how much more should we just say just pay for all the taxes.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       I say I say this, but there is no. When you. You were about to use an example from the natural world and I'm in. No, I was going to say the instinct and when you're in when you're in the natural world is that you feed your family first. You're not the idea that social goes against the natural order are we're, we're in a world of sort of accumulation and access and I don't think he's even working. I wonder about. So if I want. Because you could say where do you draw the line? Because I'm like, look at me. I've got money now. I'm not poor anymore and I'm not going right. I'll just take everything. That's the thing that I do agree with when I see you like sort of right wing commentators talk like they talk about people that are in a image from the left and like, well, why don't you put some refugees in your house?

Speaker 4:          00:43:04       Why don't you give up your money? And the reason is because people are selfish and in all of us, there is a kind of battle between some of my impulses. Candice are, I just want to. I just want pleasure and fun and I don't care about anything except myself that's in me as strong, but I personally think I don't feel good when I lived that way. There are consequences for me and there were consequences for other others. So I kind of want to live within systems that encourage collective and communal values instead of we're talking about theft. Maybe we don't have to go out demanding that people give up. Their stuff is theft. But it sounds pretty. When you say storage incentives, now when the government comes in demand to someone else, you keep translating what I'm saying. No, you're not helping me, Yo. He's talking about that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       You're translating what I'm saying into rhetoric that you can argue with. Create a straw man of my words as we go. So you know that that's. I'm not saying that. I'm saying. I'm not saying I'm not espousing the values of big government. I'm not saying that there's any political party that currently exists in any way represents my views. I'm just asking if in politics, both personally and collectively, there's room for a little more compassionate and love on, whilst I agree with your, uh, the, the, uh, that there was something easy to fetishize about individual achievements that let in your own case or wherever we see greatness. We can't take that example of the ability of the individual

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       to overcome adversity to condemn people that haven't been able to. But where is there a role then for compassion and kindness? I'm not saying there's a big government and take away from your politics. So my thing is that the cock of the conversation could be, should be completely separate. Americans give $500, billion in charity every single year. Okay? It has been proven that when you lower the tax rate, when you, when you government stays out of our paycheck, we actually give more that we're inclined to you. If you have more money and you're able to do it, of course you want to give and you want to help. When the government is saying, we're going to tax your business, if you're successful, you're going to get taxed more. What is the incentive for you to want to jump in? Build a business? If you know that you're going to be penalized for it, you're going to be penalized for success.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       That's why we believe in limited government. I say we obviously I work for an organization turning point USA. Well, it's all about winning banding and Turning Point USA. We're launching in the UK, the UK. That's what this whole trip is about. Launching, turning point and like turning point is what do you want us to turn to? We as conservative principles taught in the school system because the kids are learning this lolly Dolly, merry go round. The world's going to be purple and and we're all going to have lollipops in the school systems and then possibly from your podcasts. I guess I haven't watched enough episodes. I'm the and it's just not. It's, it's, it's the truest, the, the economic model of, of letting people find success because they're willing to work hard. If you don't want to work hard, you shouldn't be rewarded. I don't believe in that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:53       I don't believe. Well, what about the person doesn't have your drive or should economic systems govern the way that we live our lives? Why is there not room for people to be different? Why is he a person who values should be distilled into what's called the natural market? You can't make that go away. You can't make that go away no matter what, in any time in the history of the world where there hasn't been some give and some take the you cannot. You cannot do. You can't make that go away. There's no magic wand. You can wave that's going to make human incentives and what happens in humanity go away. It doesn't matter how rich or how poor society is. There's going to be given. There's going to be take. People are going to create natural markets. Hey, I have three apples. I'll give you two apples if you give me this.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       I mean that it just happens. This is the way the world works. I appreciate that. We have certain natural impulses to try it and to cooperate as opposed to where you and I are arguing for sypher sleigh and passionately. Candice is on the front of a lot. Firstly, I disagree with you that there are no social and economic factors that contribute, for example, to the phenomena of poverty and persecution of African Americans or people are like in this country. I think the experience of being a Muslim is probably difficult because of the way Islam is reported about it. That doesn't mean that, you know, I don't see that there's this thing called terrorism, but that in itself is somewhat underwritten by the colonial project. It's like you sort of deny that history has happened. No, I'm not denying that's happened. I'm just denying that I live in history. I don't live in history. I didn't go to prison. That's a variant. This. This is what people

Speaker 4:          00:47:29       harp on that and this is why they want you to focus on this. When you're in school, look at what happened. That's why you're oppressed. No, it's not. Black people were actually outpacing white Americans in the 19 fifties under Jim Crow. In terms of economic growth, until we implemented the welfare programs, we were outpacing them were there were businesses because our families were together. There was the divorce rates isn't what it was. People were married. Our families were together. We had jobs. We have starting businesses. My grandfather did better than my father did. Okay. My grandfather grew up in a segregated south. How did he do that? Because there wasn't all of this crazy nonsense. He never took welfare. There wasn't all this government regulation. He started his own business and that is how you create a successful individual. My grandfather never ever once considered himself to be a victim.

Speaker 4:          00:48:09       He doesn't. He doesn't think as you play the victim game. Anecdotal examples of individual. I'm not. I'm not, but I'm telling you that our system of government, I don't think you can realistically argue that the removal of welfare will make people go on to become a gauguin now because I think they're all you can say because it's not anecdotal. It's, it's a fact. The sign arguing. If black people were doing better under Jim crow economically than we're doing today, how is that possible? Explain it to me. I want to learn. I think the same way that you're saying that people have an automatic impulse to trade. I think we also have an automatic impulse to help one another and I think that what maybe it's happened over the last, I don't know, hundred years perhaps is part of sort of a post colonial thing is that there's been such disparity, such bifurcation of world that there's like an impoverished class that are forgotten and I would say the deeply underserved for me, I'm not qualified to talk on the issue of race, but for me intuitively, a lot of what you say is God.

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       I know that some black people were really offended by it and hurt by and feel that is a denial. Why aren't qualified to talk about race? Because I've had no personal experience of being a black person. I've never, no one's ever used the n word. Doesn't mean you can't qualify. Talk about race. Talk about anything. Matter of fact, I mean 90 percent of the things I say I'm just making up as I go along, but like, um, but my fact is my factories is the same way that I don't know about other female experiences. This is what I know what it's like to be. I do know what it's like to feel oppressed. I do know it's like to feel, not heard. I do know what it's like to feel vulnerable and I do feel as a person that can be quite rapacious, quite greedy, quite individualistic.

Speaker 4:          00:49:47       But when I live within systems that encourage those aspects of my nature by saying, look, you make your own luck in life. If you're willing to work hard, you can become anything no matter where you're from. In a sense, my life journey has been that from an ordinary working class family in Essex, single parent family, and now whoop de Doo. I'm rich, but that has not left me thinking, fuck you everyone else. But it's not like it's so I want, I want to drive. I want to drive this point home because it is. You used to be more in on the Hollywood scene in La, but this is why when these leftist politicians want to sell these ideas that are essentially just going to do to make sure that nobody has an opportunity, but everybody's married to the government, they turned to Hollywood because it's so easy to make you feel guilty.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I'm not them guy anymore, but it's so easy to make people like you. You could still say that you're. You're in the sphere of influencers. Hollywood influence as you started your career as an actor, right? I mean, so you could still say it's so easy to make them feel guilty because most of them aren't really politically savvy. They can't have even a discussion that we're having. We have no idea what's going on, but they know that they feel so guilty about being wealthy that I can come to you and I can say to you, feel guilty about being white because people make them feel guilty. I'll been welcomed. They don't understand economics. They don't realize that they provide jobs. Okay. When Kim Kardashian became Kim Kardashians, oh, should she feel guilty about that? How many people are now employed because of the Kardashian Empire?

Speaker 4:          00:51:07       How many people are employed because of twitter? You know, because Jack Dorsey created twitter and they feel guilty about it. Why do you feel you provide opportunities for people to get jobs? As human beings, we should aspire to greater goals than simply fulfilling a predetermined economic growth, but I worshiping continually are the older of finance we must do better and we must look for best solution. I don't know if you do you believe in God, right? And what is it? Belief in God if it's not a century, the belief that underneath hatred is love and underneath the individual is oneness and that what we do to one another we do to ourselves and vice versa, that we need to create systems that are reflective of our benevolence. Kindness. We don't know if you want to be good and you want to be benevolent, you can exercise that in your personal life as well.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       You and I are discussing politics. What you've done is that you've blended in your mind that politics and goodness in oneness, all she'd go together. Hell No. Okay. There is no such thing as a good government. That's why we want it limited. The idea that government is not going to become corrupt when you exercise these, these, these practices of goodness and the and that's what they do. They sell to the public, we're are going to be good for you and we're going to extract all of your dollars and everyone is going to be equal. Equally poor. Incredibly naive thing to say and I'm startled that you've said it. The reason that they want government to be impeded because easier to make money when there's huge deregulation. That's why there was the 2008 crash because the previous 20 years they'd been loaded. Loads of the regulation under the Clinton in her life for me.

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       You know, they all, they all end up in the same basket. So you're admitting that government is corrupt and yet you think that government is solution to solve crime. Government different. I'm not talking about God. You want me to talk to you because I actually think that, you know, because we are seemingly from so far apart, there we have an an an odd unity in that we both agree that government as it currently exists is a order, I want to say unacceptable, ineffective, negative, malevolent. You think the solution is a different kind of government and you think the solution is to give you more power to the already powerful. I think the government only functioned as administrative individual branches, national corporation to the individual. No, no. I never said give more individual, more powerful individual. I don't want to give up. I don't want to give up all of my rights

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       to a government. That's arbitrary. That's going to tell me how to live. It tells me what to say. I don't think anyone's gonna take away your rights. How could they what? But what? I'm interested in, what I'm interested in, either of you need to call anybody. You are enough as you are. What I'm interested in is what I believe is the government are the sort of bureaucratic arm of corporations, transnational corporations, and I think like you look at sort of any government that tries to impose serious restrictions on the way that Amazon trade and the way that Amazon are tax would suffer. We can't do that in this country. Like when are you going to win? There's talk of a sort of a more left wing government getting into power. The city's flex his muscles, everyone starts to brick. It was like, you know, shit themselves to sort of terrified, right?

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       So you know, for me it like a centralized bipartisan. The Democratic governments as they currently exist are meaningless and ineffectual. I completely agree with you there, but, but my concern is, is that we need to find new ways of curbing the power of big business. I'm not talking about some lovely bloody flourish to making their way in life or people that are entrepreneurial that is limited, but now that's why we like trump is he's disruptive because he's talking about it. We're talking about Google should be broken up. It's a monopoly. I don't agree with monopolies, right? Google is a monopoly. It's a worldwide monopoly. I have said it vocally a thousand times. Google should be broken up. Amazon is prompt, problematic. These are things that issues that trump is tackling and that's why the establishment with naive as Mark Zuckerberg, you know, testifying these, he starting to attack this because he understands that what you're talking about is real.

Speaker 3:          00:54:57       The Latin and the right combined. Right? Um, and, and that's why I say I'm not a Republican. I don't want to be associated with the swamp Republicans. I'm a or have a leftist who pretend that they're, you know, they care about people, but in reality of this extracting dollars and power for themselves as they grow government to make sure that just the bureaucrats enrich their pockets. That's what trump is disrupting. It's hard for people to process that because trump is wealthy, but that is what he's doing. I mean, if you look at every policy he's made in terms of all the activities implemented, that is why there is a war on him and all out war in terms of the media. The same is happening in other countries, you sort of populist movements are starting to arise. Um, and I support them in Italy and Brazil look like most people who are wealthy because the vagina that he emerged from, and then he did very well on top of that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:44       So I mean to describe what he's done, what he's built is, is not good. You know, he hasn't been paying and just maintain fail before they find success. You really like him, but most people fail because this is, this is what I don't like either people say because you fail. No, it's pretty funny. He's hilarious. I mean, if the people that can enjoy trump, I feel bad for that means he's pointedly hilarious. He says things that everybody's thinking and it's calling out people that have been impossibly corrupt. We're going to say lock her up. Hillary should be in prison. Most Americans feel that way. What she did to Haiti alone, what the Clinton Foundation did to Haiti alone, they should all be locked out. I'm no fan of the Clintons. I'll tell you that now. He had the balls to say it. What

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       politician? Everybody else's, oh, but it's the Clinton. That's the dynasty in the bushes. It's, you know, we can't say these things. Trump just says it. They're all corrupt. So you liked that you liked these as sort of a rabble rouser. But the thing that I would concern me is that I feel that our, um, social systems will need to look beyond terrible handouts. I wonder it world where sort of your ideology was realized as I'm starting to understand as I listened to you, like the, the sort of the individual, uh, on impeded unimpaired reaching for Nietzschean glory. What happens to people that are not in Dow with the facilities to achieve that? Because some, we are existing on a spectrum as you say. Some people just need a bit of help and a bit of love to tell the truth. If I hadn't been helped again to a treatment center, I think I'll still be on drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       If I didn't have other people helping me to stay clean one day at a time, I think I might relapse. I'm held invisibly, held by relationships with people that are kind and compassionate to me. And if it wasn't presented as if the government shrinks as your friend just got out the government though, although you just set that someone's going to have to break up these monopolies and I don't know, you think it's going to do that. Goldman Sachs government, that's what this company, our country was founded upon. Just accidentally call it a company. I'm sorry we're keeping the best company in the world. But like, you know, Britain was essentially just the sort of a front for the colonizing powers of the east India tea company. And I believe in limited government that I believe that government should come because we learned from, uh, you know, uh, the 19th, late, late 19th century, early, early 20th century that once if businesses run and they'll eventually create monopolies.

Speaker 4:          00:58:09       And that's what we're seeing, I think happened with Google and the function of the government is to protect us against that so that there's opportunities for the little guy and small businesses to get in and to compete with these bigger companies. Um, so I, I can ever work on a global level now with sort of the way that trade operates and with, and with there being such powerful monoliths already in place. Will those powers ever yield any of their potency? What would make it Google? Um, as in the silicon valley giants, the, the Energy John. So the forces that we know we're behind the sort of the recent Middle East and oil wars. What will make those companies you to some of their power, what would do that? What force could oppose that? Only the people and under what banner to the People Unite. It's like you try to, it feels to me that you're taking away the hmm. The capacity for human beings to unite under by don't agree with divisive policy of your, this gender, your, that color. I think we are one and we should look for ways to find common connections. I've got more, probably more in common with you even though there's so much different about us politically and believing in that. We're both mouthy individually. That's exactly right. And I agree with that and I think that that's important discussion to have, but when I, in terms of how I use my voice

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       and what I'm talking about, I'm in the realm of politics and I don't. I think that the problem is, is that people want to insert compassion into the political realm too much. You know, just management will, is politics is not about helping human beings to gain access to resources. It's, I really think that the what, what should be the function of a politician? What do you think that you told me you're the bloody expert. I mean they're supposed to go and what should it be? Right? I mean, I think it's gotten to the point now that it just becomes about them trying to enrich their own pocket. Should it be. I think it should be. They are there to protect the rights of the people that have already been established. You know, that they are supposed to be representing their constituents, the people that were all bloody bloody established.

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       What about people that need help? Making sure that their rights are protected, that they're able to create an ad, that they have opportunities and the idea that you can, that they'll still have opportunities if you grow government is. It hasn't been so many times nothing. It's killed 100 million people in the last 100 years. It's, it's, it's jarring to me that we have people that are running around saying that it's good again, especially in Europe. I mean, you guys really should understand that social doesn't work. I mean like really like what is it going to take for your. How many times did we have to get the phone call and America, Hey, you dare doing again. You will let this run because we're like, really? Guys, again, we're doing it again. Like, no, it's different. This is different. Jeremy Corbyn's like a democratic socialist who says a lot of antisemitic things, you know, it's like, really?

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       How many times do you guys have to. What's it gonna take for you guys to learn your lesson? I mean, that's how I feel, at least in America and I love my breasts. Look, we, we fight. We ended the wars together so that, I mean, that's why we're doing tpu kegs. It's like, all right, it's getting a little crazy again. Might have to step in and start some normal conservative principles again into the dialogue because we've got it. It's gone crazy. The socialist, it doesn't work on crazy. There is no. There is no meaningful socialism at any level of power. Anyway. Let's see. Where was it? What do you. What do you mean? Anywhere? Venezuela. What do you mean? There's no. No. Always banging on about 15 people live there. Don't you dare come to the United States. They're United States. You know, the average citizen has last April.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Have an over here. You guys should like put me finish whitelaw. I'm the Venezuelan people. I don't think the social, the experiments with socialism in a very common in Venezuela or having any meaningful impact on the American economy or the global economy or global or geopolitical power structures. So what I'm interested in is my friend. Why all this macron fascist. He's a total. No, no, he's a global list. He's on. He's on a fascist. The globalist. Okay. And, and, and all of the people that stood up and said awful things about trump are now realizing that everything that he was saying was essentially right, you know, and his people think about what's going on in, is fascinating. The far left and the far right are together rioting in the streets. I love that. Think about that and why? Because of these things, like what was the tipping point?

Speaker 3:          01:02:30       They were hiking prices to protect the environment. Again, they, they, they're going to tell you that they're doing something to protect you, but extracting, finding fun ways to extract dollars. Now there is no jobs and people are unemployed. Every ones on welfare and government programs and on top of that. So you asked what happens in socialism every single time she met kronas associates, which is just bizarre to me because he's a former social. France has been proliferating a welfare state since the 19 seventies. Okay. And that's what it is. There are people don't work in French. They're lazy. And that's what happens in a socialist model. Everyone becomes lazy because you're going to say, if you become Richmond attacks you with, why the hell am I going to work all, sit back and wait for the government to give us handouts. Oh wait, that can't happen because now there's no one left. The tax. Everybody's equally. You guys are right. Socialism does call poverty crime base for socialism. If you want equality, they will. They reasonable

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       what? Look, I've been a bit Glib and a bit silly at several points during this conversation because I find you very charming and interesting to talk to, but I must say in all seriousness that you cannot cite any of these countries as examples of socialism or socialism's of failures because they. Because macron is existing with comfortably within the framework of the kind of neo, neo liberal failings that are bringing about the current mass discontentment that has brought about brexit and trump and I think that neither brexit nor trump will address or eight ordinary people. One Jot. Not that I disagree with people who are voting for Brexit or for voting for trump because I agree with them that things weren't going well for ordinary people and I understand their dissatisfaction, but what I don't see how the solution to the problems of ordinary people will ever be to give more power to the already powerful.

Speaker 2:          01:04:20       I wouldn't confront you hugely over the government. I think you and I both do not trust government. I'm, I'm beginning to work out where people from the left and where they can, uh, collaborate, collude and agree. But obviously the, the main problem for me is that I feel that all politics ultimately has to be an expression of human goodness. And whilst it is ultimately about pragmatism, what is the point in being pragmatic? If we're not symbol timelessly, being loving and beautiful, what is our aim? What is the optimum? What are we trying to achieve? And surely that must be a fair and just world where the brilliant get to thrive and the vulnerable are loved and taken care of. A shaming that there are still categories such as the vulnerable and the brilliance. I love everything you said is it sounds totally utopia,

Speaker 3:          01:05:14       but it's just not pragmatic. Well, that's what people say. It is.

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       Not Conservative. Can created government for me right now. What are you going to do? Oh, let's do it. Let's do it right now. No, I mean seriously, because this is how. This is how socialism gets sold because it sounds good. Hey, but that is a socialist socialist pitch. That's that's what they be socialist, right? Amount. Saying the Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez. I just want a world where everybody, the minimum wage is $30 an hour and I don't know who's going to pay for it. Doesn't matter. We're going to talk practically. It's going to feel good. We're going to just tax the rich and we're going to take from this person. You can only take from the rich for so much. Essentially what you have to focus on is creating opportunities for every single person to become rich, systemic inequality and a massive philosophical disjunct in the fact that when there was, when all these systems, these systems that you say are going to take care of us, they're going to create trickle down wealth, but when they did ultimately inevitably fail, they would, but when they do fail, they are bailed out by the people.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       That's the people, ordinary people, so why should I trust those? Shouldn't, but why don't you keep telling us that we should grow government. I'm not telling you to centralization. I do think that we need programs to help people know what I'm thinking. The words are coming. Let's do it. We're building your community. Okay, but that's your position. That's a conservative position. We're saying all of these programs, entities might need some assistance to you. I think you just don't realize that you're a conservative. Listen, you are a conservative because you were. You're identifying the same problems and you're agreeing the solution not be more candidates, but you've backed socialist candidates, which makes no sense. Everything lines up biggest trouble. I go and we're saying, oh, don't vote for anyone because I think it's all total bullshit and it ends with the power ends up in the hands of the same people anyway, and it was as if I kicked the football, it really prime minister, the Guardian, The Guardian as a matter of fact shot and were probably the worst job that sort of changed their propaganda.

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       Yeah, they're just literally propaganda by finger that, but why I would say that the differences between some of these things that we're arguing about, the distinctions are negligible. I think that what's required is a kind of radicalism, radical change, but what makes me nervous about some of the stuff you say candice, is it's kind of lack of empathy. I can't help but see that teenage girl with Anorexia not being treated with love and care and nurture. What? That you get what I'm saying. Does that make it more likely that people feel loving and compassionate? I don't think that's the role of the government. I think that's the role of the family. So if we were. This is not about politics and we started

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       talking about posting done raising kids, but I was so compassionate.

Speaker 4:          01:08:20       Industrial post technological capitalist societies. The family is no longer an all powerful unit. There is already such massive inequality. I'm not. I'm not clever enough to argue with you about whether or not big government centralization is problematic as you say, but what I do know is unimpeded capitalist power is the biggest contribution to the problems we have in the world. Okay? Actually no, so socialism has has killed. It's not capitalism killed 100. We don't know. It was harder to. Harder to curate the information. We don't know how many people are killed in the various colonial wars that America has been engaged with ever since the Second World War. All of those economic, close ideological component of that is because, and, and I will agree with you here, the idea that you're going to go and you don't have natural resources because I don't know, environment environmentally friendly. Kids don't want you to do fracking or whatever it is, and then you go and you say, well, here's an oil rich country and we're going to go and we're going to invade it. We're going to take things over. I disagree. I disagree with all of that, so it'd be an Itam has got to be the aim. You can't be seriously saying that Islam should be the aim. Did you just shouldn't be. That shouldn't be the. I literally like like that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:29       Well, I will also be the place where we all can't happen. It can't happen. Human beings are always going to. I've since the, since biblical times, there are always going to battle. The point of the Bible is that we will transcend that. A man will transcend. Here. We can get beyond that. Primal desires, our primal desires that you're trying to turn into systems, greed, jealousy, conservatism. No, no, no. It's the opposite. I'm saying you have to acknowledge that this exists. This is why it's foolish when people gave up all of your and then what happens? What happened to Venezuela when they get up all the rights and they sold them this utopian concept that Russell brand loves and there's going to be flowers and Venezuela and skittles and we're all going to go to Willy Wonka everyday because what happened? Oh, we found out what happens when you give all your money, the government, the government keeps it found in medicine.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       Well, because you know why? Because the government is governed by human beings and human beings are greedy or you know, if you're a terrible human being, but when you give them all of your money, you're going to see what happens in times. Individuals, candice, these untrammeled individuals that have gotten no regulation, well, they're going to be different from the Venezuelan government aid government where they, when their incentives are not to go line their own pockets and government and know that they have term limits and that they literally are there to serve the people. Okay, interesting. Then allow them to do their damn job and look at these companies and say, is this now but not Napoli? Yes, it is.

Speaker 4:          01:10:56       Break up Google will that we agree on that as well. As long as it still works, because I do need it mostly for my own name. Now. I just need a search engine called the Russell brand search engine that be enough for me. As long as I have that, you can break up that monopoly.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       Candice, there's another thing I'm going to ask you. That thing you just said mate, about like a human beings are greedy and cruel and components of humanity. Here were. You said that that's huge for me. When you said that. I thought it was very telling. I feel that that is ultimately what you believe. I think human beings are vocally. I do think that first time, what do you think? First off human beings do you. I'll ask you a question. Do you think were more good or more evil? Good. I think human beings are beautiful. What do you think were born? Pure and good and wonderful. You have a small child as soaps and teach human beings. Good. Listen, the culture is definitely a factor, but this is my point. You've asked me a question. Please allow me to out sultanates and says the line between good and evil runs, not through nations, religions or creeds, but through every human heart, because I know that there is darkness in me.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       I know there is selfishness and greed and and like Libido, life force, not necessarily a bad thing, but last, for example, I know all these things exist in me, so I need to exist within communities and systems that acknowledge that I am flawed and that I can fail, but encourage the better parts of my nature. For me, that is not a kind of Venal, economically driven system that rewards kind of the pursuit of excess. We can. I don't think we can ever be fulfilled by commodity. I don't think we can ever be fulfilled through acquisition. I think that our goals must become spiritual, but I agree with that. I'm not in favor of creating banal Stalinist, a massacre factories, but I also resent and reject the illusion of a commercial capitalist state where people are being underserved spiritually. People are neglected and cut off and below.

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       Oh, drew Loki. We're with them. We've ever been statistically things that Upi, well, I live in this world and I feel a lot of dissatisfaction, a lot of pain. I've been rich, I've been poor, I've been in both of those worlds and I sense that there is something spiritual that is not being served, that is being neglected and I feel a huge part of that is living in a world where the supreme ideals are economically driven, where there is a huge unfairness, where we are ignoring the problems of the earth and to hear you talk about a sort of fracking and like in it simply because it is another way of serving conservative or capitalist goals. That concerns me. Well not I brought it up because you brought up the Middle East and the conquest that we're going over there because he wanted their conservatism used to be about conserve the planet. First and foremost. You've got to live on it. I don't think that in America it concerned me. It means used to be supply about conserving. We've got to look after the care a little more about the environment here than in America. We have the like obviously the environmentalist, but I think probably stronger here I've noticed. I'm not saying there's one way one is wrong or one is

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       right. I'm just making a note here. How could we. What you're talking about is that you think that all that exists is politics. Take Yoga class. You want some spiritual balance after you go to work or you go take a yoga class. You had the money to do that. Um, to go. Do you sit and do Koombaya and do all of that stuff. I like it all. Family. It's not cynical, but I really, I like getting from Yoga. I Love Yoga. I love spiritualism. I told you I originally found you because you were talking about spiritualism. I was like on Youtube and I remember just being very granted would show was never seen that show before. But you were talking about spiritual fulfillment and I agree with you on all of those things. Where we disagree is that you don't seem to think that both of those can live at the same time.

Speaker 3:          01:14:54       Like if capitalism exists in spiritualism, die, it's. No, it doesn't. You can be spiritual and you can let capitalism you like it. A capitalist says, I like. I like switches from so much I'm going to open a yoga studio. Know that is turning everything into a commodity like ultimate end of everything is to turn and I'm guilty of this. As soon as I like genuine, I'm the kind of person. I make up a beautiful song from my door and Oh my God, I should write a children's book about this. I have that interesting. I am an entrepreneurial person. I am an individualist, but I feel that these impulses in me kind of be better utilized if they are in the service of others, so then share it. That's what I do. I get spiritual fulfillment when, when, when black kids from the ghettos and and the hood, right?

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       To me and say thank you so much. Finding your perspective has transformed my life. Right? And they say, because I just put out something that I genuinely believe in and it's backed in my heart and it's back to my spirit. Now what fulfills you might be something different, but you determining that what people should like and what should dry you know, what fulfills that are, what should be compassionate. That's that. Those are words that are subjective. They're not objective. It's subjective. I think that's true and I think I can understand why a young black children would be inspired by a powerful woman like you who communicates brilliantly and is so strong and successful, but I would imagine it may be disheartening to hear you disavow the impact of social historical and cultural influences on the plight of individuals and individual families to extract that. I think he's cool, but I don't talk about it all the time doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:16:32       You're condemning people in saying that the individual is in charge of their own destiny. You are. You are in the shadow of that is people that are responsibility of to blame. Yeah. No, I. I truly believe if people wake up and they understand that they even control their own destiny, that they can, they will be in control of. That is a good point. I think that's a good point, but I do also agree that that is the obligation of all of us to be careful, protect, reach out to one another and I feel like I'm concerned by that. I'm concerned that you feel that because it's sort of like for me, where is the love? What do you mean there's, there's love. In my personal life, I don't feel bad for people that are lazy and looking for excuses. So if that sounds, if that feels like.

Speaker 3:          01:17:19       And that's like, hold on, let's get to the course. I figure most people are lazy. Okay. Much. Right? Yeah, there you go, brother. Get success and then you know what? When you get to a certain age and you realize you have accomplished nothing or drove and all of a sudden you became. I mean say, but most people are lazy. It's true. I'd rather be in bed sleeping sometimes when I get up and I do stop because I realized I have to be different, but here's the thing. You asked telling me what I have to extra eyes compassionate. Understanding how people are lazy because they woke up one day and they're 27, they realize you have accomplished nothing, so they turned to videos that tell them that it's not their fault, it's somebody else's. It's the white man. It's the rich man. It's the tall man.

Speaker 3:          01:17:55       It's the short man, right? I don't care about any of that. I am telling you that personal responsibility is really the key to unlocking light. CanNot deny things that happened and did you exercise compassion in those moments? That's why I give to charity, right? It's not going to be enough because by taking the lazy people in my home, I've already got a cat. She's pretty fucking lazy because what I'm saying is this. What am I saying? What are you saying to me? So I'm saying to you that you are misusing your power, that you should be using your power to bring other people up. That's what I'm doing. And I feel that to deny that there, that there is economic disparity. The racial inequality is part of the story, but historically there has been a component of the male oppression of a female. I don't.

Speaker 3:          01:18:52       I agree with that. I agree that the world puts. You're talking about our stories individually agree with. We're agreeing everything that you just. I don't deny. I acknowledged that there's economic disparity because I tell them everyday the reasons why is why I teach them. There's economic disparity. Don't be so foolish to believe it's because your skin is black. It's because we are disproportionately taking handouts from the government. We are disproportionately marriage the government, and we have bought into our own victim mentality. Okay, because we're taking advice from fucking Lebron James about politics and voting in people that want to do harm to the black community. Plan. Simple. Most people don't even know their own history. You sit down and and you have black people that are advocating for planned parenthood and nobody's talking about the quiet black genocide that's taking place in America right now because our birth rate has completely stagnated and we're the only ones.

Speaker 3:          01:19:36       Sixty one percent of all new brush Latino. So in the Democrats say open borders, open borders. What they're really saying is boats, boats, because the black people are not gonna. Be able to stay in our party much longer, so let them know that planned parenthood was created by an avowed racist, Margaret Sanger who said that her purpose was to exterminate the black race. She said, black people should be exterminated like weeds. Most bucket don't know that, and yet they go out and they say conservatives are crazy because they want to defund planned parenthood defunded because the black, the black birth rate has has stagnated. Okay, so I'm actually all about black and power, which is why when people actually find me long former listened to

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       what I say, it clicks and they say, oh my God, and then they researched Margaret sanger and then they researched that, the black birth rate, and they realize that we have literally we are paying politicians taking the to tear apart our families and it makes sure that we don't have a place in America. I look, I agree with some of the things that you are saying, but what I don't understand is how this information can neatly absolves or resolve itself at the point of a much wider. Donald trump's a good thing that's crazy. So easily illusion, so easy. It's so easy. That's how I got into this because because Donald Trump was a thing, Donald Trump has done more for the black community then. Then certainly any of the predecessor Democrat presidents had done beforehand. You know, you have Bill Clinton who was held as a black presidential hero, but first black president is what they called Bill Clinton.

Speaker 4:          01:20:55       He also locked up more black men than any president in the history of the United States. That's a fact. He put in place with three strikes, laws. That's a fact. Um, and then you have lbj hailed as a hero in our textbooks. He's the one that implemented the welfare state and he called her the nigger bill. You know, he, he literally called, uh, the civil rights act, the nigger belt bucket, but don't know that now it's all available on the Internet. So they're, all they have to do is hear what I say. And they'll do that after they watch this podcast and do research and they go, why is it, why is the education system lying to me? Why do I think Bill Clinton's a good person? After what he did to Haiti, and I don't disagree with you, I mean like I think more broadly, I can see how you meet a lot of your goals by condemning apparently left centrist politicians who I remember I've already told you I don't see the distinction between left and right within the limited framework of conventional political. That's fair as a, uh, as, as meaningful. Yeah. Go and have some stuff to eat. The perhaps perhaps perhaps the problem is actually that you're hungry. Was Secretary happened because a hungry person who's taking it out on most vulnerable members of society and the black community and the black community for synchronous. Now you sound like every leftist politician script. I'm empowering for black people. All they have to do is listen. The

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       goal of your empowerment, it ends in a sort of a rather unpleasant individualistic message that leaves behind that doesn't include the possibility that some people's social history and personal history has left them impaired and unable to compete in a system but prizes, certain assets, certain personal attributes above others. None of us like that. We need a culture that can accommodate all people because all people exist and all people do have rights and if you like, whilst I feel like you know, I can see the logic in, you know, or what you're saying about I'm like, you know, the patriarchy stuff and all that. All you need to do is all we need to do is quickly look at who has the most wealth, who has the most power, who has the most influence that day areas available. Like something like that. You know when you say if like s like 15 people have

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       as much wealth as the poorest 5 billion people. That's not minor. That's a serious systemic problem. We could solve a great many problems by simply removing and redistribute in that wealth, but even that's not enough. I'm undergrad changing systems more broadly where we do agree hugely as on decentralization and the breakup of monopolies. But what I think is the biggest distinction you and I have is your belief that people are governed by selfish, selfish impulses and my belief that people are ultimately good and that we should create systems and communities and values that encourage our virtue rather than usher us subtly towards either nihilism or selfishness, and I think that that's what you are doing better than that. I'm preventing people from falling into your logic because the easiest people to take advantage of people that believe what you believe, because then all they do is to take somebody like George Soros or Jeff Bezos to say, this is why they want socialism because it says all of you guys, you're going to stay poor, but we're going to sell to you that we're going to fix all your problems.

Speaker 4:          01:24:10       You're going to get all of your rights to us, and that's what happens. That's what happens every single time. Realized that within a system that has limited resources available to become rich anyway, you think there's finite resources. What? On a finite planet? Yes. No, no, but like at once starting, people are and nobody else can get rich because that's wrong. Hold on a second then. Why do you not believe you don't believe that there's a stagnation in stacy's in where wealth is accumulated and where wealth is held. Do you not see that there are a dentist? If you're buying into the myth that because somebody got rich, somebody else got poor and that's wrong because somebody got rich multiples, perhaps our job because somebody got, which does not mean that a bunch of other people got poor. That is a fallacy and it is. No, that's just pulled back when Jack Dorsey of twitter got rich, all of his employees got poor and note they became employees of twitter, facebook employees.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       I'm a ton of people all around the world because they're facebook now. Are they always register? Mark Zuckerberg? No, but they were given opportunities to get their foot in the door at a tech company and it put facebook on their resume pro. The old capitalism. I notice candice is. I listened to you. Big Secret. I'm Amazon, right? So listen, here's the, uh, there's, the world is limited. It's only that big. There are people on the world, only a tiny number of people have got most of the wealth and asset. Oh, if some of it will trickle down to the others, that's that the, the idea that I did not work out, your people are keeping that wealth and not letting it trickle down, sticking people in prison because there are these brilliantly economic. How do you extract well from wealthy people? Take it. See that? That's your problem.

Speaker 4:          01:25:49       That's theft. No competition, free markets, building a product that's better than facebook to this, that would lead to. So what led to this mobilism in which something that I am staunchly against and I speak out about all the time, don't agree with globalism. Globalism is a bunch of elitist. Fighting themselves and saying, wait a second. How much power we control now that can make sure that we're the only ones that maintain more regulation. That's more government. No, it's not. It's the function of government to make sure that that doesn't happen. Limited government. That is literally why we started putting in place these policies in America. If the government hasn't happened, listened to finish, being able to run without a government, both literally eating food now all over the microphone. If the government, so that we currently have on able to curb or in any way control corporate power, how is less government going to do that more effectively or less government busters to fight you.

Speaker 4:          01:26:40       And when I'm saying limited government, so the idea that growing welfare programs and trying to extract wealth from the rich, it's just, it's not gonna work that's not, that doesn't work over time because that if you want to talk about a finite resource, there's only so much money you can bleed out of rich people. Um, and, and that's, and it never happens that way by the way. They take money from the rich and they enrich themselves. The government gets bigger, the government gets Richard and people get poor. That is what the history of the world taught us. Some things to be annoying, you know, because it's true, you know, you know, Cuba, you know all, you know what happened in the Soviet Union, you know what happened in Cuba, you know what's happening in Venezuela, you know that social and doesn't work and get your, your teaching or having your stroke, but you are, you're just not calling it socialism.

Speaker 4:          01:27:20       That's what you're talking about. We can't give. What is the new system. You're either going to grow government or you're going to grow the individual. No, there's no. That's not the only option. Oh, Gimme. GimMe Gimme. Another option. I think de-centralized collectivized communities, a confederacy of principled, cooperating, fully autonomous self governing communities that might require to some degree, some ability to tax regulate and control. Certainly the kind of transnational monoliths that we tax to the government. I don't know, but what's the problem? But. But hold on a second, you can't like get all like me because I have. I'm not able to immediately designed a new system. It's not immediately. You've been doing this for awhile and when I listen to, it's not the first time you've had this conversation. You're either you, you want to play it both ways, so you want to say I believe in the community, but the community should tax.

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       Okay, so the community should be a government website and let's try and see if we can work out together because if it's not good, we just simply won't you because he's a bit of the podcast. We're going to use all of it. People need to know we are building a government thing, right? Just say it, right? Say we like take for example, now we've had brexit. Britain could be an independent unit if I agree that we decentralized government power because it is meaningless and it doesn't serve ordinary people. However, what we need people do. Some people, a lot of people it seems to want jobs and they want to be meaningfully paid for those jobs. Some people that I think are not paid enough money, police, nurses, teachers, none of these people are paid enough for what they do. That's because of the unions. That's because the government.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Oh yeah, the LG unions and the government allow us to fire fire, bad teachers bringing negative things in there. You're white bringing negative energy. It's true. The government is is the reason for that now differently in this new utopia that we're trying to create. It wouldn't. Your gender, religion, and race would be irrelevant to you? You'd be free to practice whatever. It's foolish. I already don't have this government. That's insane. Hold on. Maybe the government is not done anything yet. This is ridiculous. What's ridiculous? Let me ask you a question. Actually a very good question. Most of you offset those talks to you. No. Okay. Listen, Paul wrote the myth of Co a. that's a loaded question. Do you believe in multiculturalism? Do I believe that there are many cultures that they can just exist, coexist peacefully? I think that there are many cultures think that they can exist.

Speaker 4:          01:29:53       I think we're two people in a room and it's a problem, so of course there's going to be conflict if people have got different belief systems. However, we cost like, Yo, right, hold on a minute, so you want total deregulation of bloody capitalists, but when it comes to what people want book people read when they're praying, oh, suddenly, suddenly there is a regulation. You can be whatever religion you want to be an American. There's no regulation on that, but what I'm saying she was, do you believe that that mold, multiple cultures can coexist peacefully because that's it. That's a. that's a huge problem. What do you believe in then secretary? I believe that the biggest problem facing Europe right now is the is the mass migration from countries that do not support the culture of Europe. Right? Look, shut up. Let's talk about some. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:30:34       Good. To talk about some positive thing. Trying to create a utopia or over here in this thing, in this new, this new Britain that we're trying to create on my ipad. It doesn't matter what your gender is or how you identify. It doesn't matter what color you are and it doesn't matter what your religion is. You can't buy. You cannot impose your will on other people. You can't go around saying you, but you should believe this or you shouldn't believe that. You've got to leave people a hell alone. Right? It doesn't work. It doesn't yell. Component of Sharia law is that people that are non believers get killed. Hold on a second. I didn't say we will help you. We want Sharia law. I'm not bringing in Sharia law. That's not. We're not having met on the island. It sounds terrifying, right? Bomb this sharia.

Speaker 4:          01:31:13       Now what we're gonna do on the island now, he said, people can be fully there, fully autonomous. They can do what they want. Now. I suppose we are going to have to have communities now. I think it might be hard for human beings to live in communities that are too big. I think many of the problems that we're experiencing now is it's hard for us to hold the number of relationships we see. Too much variety of life is confusing for people. I think we need to live in smaller communities and within these communities, these units, these, let's call them Soviet people. People have full a full democracy within it. People vote on how they want their resources as happened. Importantly, agree Brazil, you vote on like say each community is allocated a budget and the members of that community vote for how to spend that budget.

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       Okay. Right. That's good. So far we do need some municipal resources, IEA, roads, Agri police officers, fire malaise, fireman and nurses. All of those. So that revenue has got to come from somewhere. Private business world isn't gas attacks I'm comfortable with because it's for municipalities and that's the difference between not theft and something that I get to use. So I need it now. Do wheat right now. Are we gonna? Need some kind of. Because people are going to be jealous of this. They're going to want to come and live here with us. We're going to identify how are we going to control the population we have here, right? We're going to need to know, right? Okay. We good? We can just like we're not building, we're an island. We're surrounded by a moat already. Look, what I'm saying is that there are so many unexplored possibilities and um, people on both the left and right and I've got those I spoke to, enough of them now impede further debate and progressing by insisting that their preexisting ideology is the only thing that could possibly work as if history were rich enough and long enough that blinking of an eye, the expanding of one flower, the issue manatee were enough to examine all possibilities.

Speaker 4:          01:33:10       Now me, all that stuff you say is wooly wishy washy left the crowd. Clap trap is mere pragmatism. The experience of being human is painful enough without us being cruel to one another. We need to live in communities where people are infested and administrative and certainly our democratic level in the way that their resources are spent and the way their communities are run, the way their schools around the way their hospitals around full democratization. So that's what I'm arguing for. So everything that you just drew is America. The founding, the founding principles of America is what you just do. And that's what conservatives fight for. I'm going to against it that you are conservative. You just haven't acknowledged it yet. I'm not concerned. You don't realize it. I'm just going to say that you're an anarchist and you don't acknowledge it, but because you want to break down all power structures and you think that people want the government where you just wrote municipalities, that's the function of government.

Speaker 4:          01:34:06       The government should make sure that those programs run efficiently, that that, that we have access to other people are paving roads and that sort of a thing. The, the infrastructure, all of that is an important thing. I think might bust up your conservative thing, but, but our priorities are not commerce. Our priorities are creating a nourishing the communities that we live in supporting and loving one another, so according to each, according to their needs, that commerce that is common, this call it community ism is community is we make the community the most important thing and the w. What the community has to do is empower the individual and love the individual and acknowledged that we in our history of colonization and war, we have hurt and damaged one another and people are carrying trauma and pain from like your anorexia and racial abuse is another lesson for me are prime examples of exactly that and it to you for the way that you have alchemize that into individual potency, but I don't think we should be getting off the train too early.

Speaker 4:          01:35:13       Why set the bar so low for humankind? Not only are we not victims, we can be glorious. We are not determined by our lower instincts and the lower aspects of our nature. We can continue to grow. Continue to aspire. The thing is is that when I asked you to draw it out, your drawing systems that already exist, but to create anything new and so we can't look good, but we can look back into the history and see how it worked out. Communism. Now hold on. I'm not drawing things that. Hold a sec. Mao was hardly. Decentralist was so serious. Centralized power and bureaucracy. No, but he raised that uprising that you're talking about the proletariat versus the rich people, but you need an asset, your you, your wire riding on the wave of contemporary populism and populism. As Steve Bannon says, could go either way. It could go either way.

Speaker 4:          01:36:01       Eva, ordinary people go, yeah, it's really going to help me to deregulate the already powerful people that are trotting around the globe like ogres or we could through this wave of populism, empower community, empower ordinary people, and we are all ordinary people ultimately in spite of our various individual skills and they don't like the word capitalism. I don't like the the goals. Your individual should be the goal. I just send a message and be rewarded this much and you decided that the balance in your life is that you want to instead go and gifts the community more that should be allowed, but why should you be able to govern how much I give to the community versus how much I get to myself. That's wrong. That makes you a dictator. You decided that you know so well about society that you're going to sell everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:36:50       I didn't say that, but I'm saying the big year, like the concepts that you're preaching here because you don't like to name what you're saying, right? You don't like it when I say social. No, I didn't say that. Yeah, you drew you. You're basically telling us and this entire podcast and the next minute you say, I'm a consultant. A bit of both. Conservative, Communist, complicated. These are times when the old divide, excuse me, and the old polarities are starting to dissolve. While we feel like people are becoming more and more opposed to each other, I think we're becoming closer and closer to rejecting the systems that oppress us, not just economically that's a. These are the crumbs I'm talking about spiritually preventing people from realizing their potential. So I do believe in the power of previously oppressed people, but I think to like people, you know, as an individual, I wouldn't like to continue to revel in my misery or this and that. We will want to do. People do need to progress. I'm like to deny like something as God historically scarring I slavery, so why would I be scarred by that were over. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a hereditary

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       trauma. I mean even psychological leftist professor, probably Cambridge because we'll the same way that we evolve features. We evolve emotionally and something is as recent as that. That is so ridiculous. Everybody that has been. Everybody feels like it's. Everyone has been a slave at some point. There was slavery here too. Did you feel your slavery pain the other week? I'm from Essex. Should we hold hands? No. Slavery that we both experienced. Oh my gosh. Oh, that feels so good to acknowledge. Finally something that we both feel might be concerned. Candice. Now listen, Jenny, my. You've got his picture before pose her elegant.

Speaker 3:          01:38:50       It's so sad. No, this. This feels good, but why? Why would you think that people should revel in mystery, but we have to acknowledge pain. You have to acknowledge that history has happened. What do you think about reparations? The pain doesn't exist anymore. What do we think about against it? There would be no United Kingdom. There will be no United States slippery slope I've ever heard in my entire life. Why? What'd you think it would slip and slide off quality? No, it wouldn't. It wouldn't. It would go into. Okay, but before, before we were slaves in Africa, we have. Everybody has. How has it in their past. So how far back do you want to do operations? Roman empire. Do you want to go back to that? Do the Italian. So everybody. Reparations. You get what I'm saying? It's the slope is so slippery that you can't make a point in society.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       And by the way, the best reparations, the most successful people in the world ring lines a system is a line you're currently saying, well, let's not do any reparation. No, I don't believe there's no share any wealth. That's where the lines are currently drawn. So for me, people that talk about reparations, they've raised an important point by exposing the fact that they use, excuse me, great countries about the United Kingdom, United States of America, entirely founded on stolen his books. You talk about taxation of the rich have been stealing them. What the fuck was slavery? What the fuck was colonialism other than stealing on a massive scale? You can't have one without the other. What I'm saying is that slavery still exists in Africa today. So for people to pretend that we were, it was stolen from him like we were kings and Queens and Africa's a myth. No, we were slaves were sold by our own people.

Speaker 3:          01:40:23       So who are we met at the Africans we met at the Americans. It's a piece of furniture that happened. It was very unfortunate. Okay. But it happened to be. It is unfortunate, but it happens everywhere there. There's not that long ago. No, but since the beginning of time there had been slaves. So how do you decide that one black slaves in America are the ones deserve reparations? Every. The slope is. And let me tell you something. You. No, no, no. The challenge. Black Americans. Would you rather be in America today? Do you wish it never happened?

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       They single black America and I've met will tell you if they wish they lived in Africa to say, do you want to know why? Because all the opportunities are in America. Black Americans today. If we banded together would be the 30, 30, I think number six in terms of the economy in the world. How'd you mean band together? Like if we said we're going to carol and little country black Americans, so yeah, we would be. Would be ranked as like that happened it. Hey, the way the visa people are talking to just my. We have self segregation happening in America now, which is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life. I want you to be more optimistic. I wouldn't you be more ambitious. I feel like you were there. How old are you? If I'm a 29. Oh my God. Is that older?

Speaker 4:          01:41:28       Young? Yeah. Holder young. Young. What happened? What happened? We have a. hold on. Let me do this sort of questions that are easy to make clips out of. I might have to. Jennifer. Things we might have to lift up is. I think I've called you love twice. Like six to go see. There we go. Now we're living. It didn't mean to do it. I'm in love as in an affection towards you. So. But that's what I'm. That's what I'm saying. It's like, why can't you say that? Because some people find it offensive. I hate the society we live in. It's a joke, right? This is know. Um, I mean the side of trying to create leftists only you only elect this would pull that out of a clip and say it's wrong. Only left. This gets mad when a, a man opens the door and the real power though.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       No, yeah, they do because they're dressing it up as feminism when in reality they're gaining power. But power is control over resources. They just saying something to your soul rose thing. Of course there is. When they, when they freak out, they try to, to stop. Breck had enough from being nominated to the supreme court. That was radical feminism. He never sexually harass anybody. Never happened. I'm sure different kind of interview, but have a field day with you because the things you say like, uh, like properly rape is a thing now. So we have to acknowledge it right now. Now listen to A. I'm going to stop you. You're scared. I'm not scared that I will say for you, which is a wonderful quality and a human, where do you think true power lies within the individual, within yourself?

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       Well, that's not true. Is it because of the individual on this planet is as powerful as Halliburton? Well, what do you. What's your measure of power or ability to get what you want done, but what? What do you want done? That varies from individual to individual. So the power rests with the individual. There is a uniform concept of will and the people whose will is most easily exerted. There is a, there is a hierarchy, so I would say and the most powerful people that people are generally born into positions where the power was already had already been accumulating. All. Alright. But it's definitely true though, and we're going to edit this so that your response will be rough. You've really changed my mind. What you said, you really changed my mind. What you said was so insightful and so. Yes. I'm so glad to be here. That's the trailer candies. Well, about this thing here. Um, do you think this is a good question jenny? Jenny wrote this question, do you think the old Protestant myth that working hard and personal responsibility is deployed to prevent governments

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       and authorities from actually helping? Yeah, it is, isn't it? Well, yeah. Well, the idea is that we don't want governments. We, we, we believe in ourselves on a community level so that, that's the, that's the goal is to realize that the job of a government wasn't supposed to be to, to um, government. Every piece of our lives, you know, the government in many ways is trying to replace God, you know, at people you through like that idea, and I agree with it. But statism and post Westphalian tree nationalism simply replace the notion of a, an omnipotent and that, that that's definitely true. Well, according to my little brain right now, what about this thing here? I want to ask our county West Corp, that's a very sort of important celebrity type of thing. So, uh, what happened there? Uh, which, which ports, like he's banging into, you know, he says, I've been used to mean by first and foremost.

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       I don't, I, I know Kanye didn't write those sweet. It's not how he speaks, but Kanye realized very soon, and this is the cleanest I can say it because I did make a promise to him that I wouldn't speak about this publicly, but Kanye realized, I think very quickly that there no such thing as doing politics halfway. You are either fully in and you risk everything around you, your friends, your family, your, your, wherever you are in life, your business negotiations, like in the way that trump did or you're out of it. And unfortunately in this I guess is public. Uh, you know, Kim always says that she disagrees with Kanye. I'm politically and so for him to cause a tremor in his life all around him, he has children, young, you know, young children. Um, that's a risky deal to make. I mean, he also has his big adidas deal.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       That's a risky thing to do, to go into politics and upon and Maggie had to talk to trump and the left controls hollywood. I mean, that's just what it is, you know, that, um, they all think the same. Every award show. It's not even funny anymore. It's just like, just talk about trump for the next two hours. I mean, it's a joke. They've ruined comedy. Um, and I think that a cognac, it was receiving a lot of heat and he respectfully needed to step out of the kitchen. I, you know, I guess I was his entrance into positive politics and I was just entrance out. It was him tweeting me that caused the entire firestorm and it was him tweeting me that was the same way out. But I deeply respect him. You mean the. So you feel like when people get involved in politics is, it's all consuming.

Speaker 1:          01:46:03       Oh, it's it. Every layer of your life they, they try to find everything you've ever done in your entire life. They try to get people to speak out against you. The amount of fights I've had with my family because reporters call and say things that I never said, Hey, Kenneth tells me you're this or that. And then your parents obviously think that they're telling the truth and they get all flustered and they are super proud of you. I, Hey, grandpa loves Robert and Granddad applebee's. I, yeah, well I'm his child, I'm just, he, he's somebody that started his life on a sharecropping farm and worked his butt off. Never said he couldn't do something because he was black or he was just advantage because he grew up in a segregated south. He just worked hard, kept his head down, do what he had to do and found success. And I know I definitely got my motivation in life from his sort of steady counseling. He's like a no nonsense.

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       Um, he sounds like an incredible man. Yeah. How do, what do you feel like success is gonna look like for you ultimately? You know, what would it feel like success for you? How? What would make you fulfilled? Candice? I think first and foremost, cracking the black vote. Showing that we're not a monolith, that we think differently and that we're starting to listen to the policies. Not The emotional argument for any group of individuals to be voting in 90 percent margins for one party shows you that at, especially when that party has never done anything that has served you, shows you that we've made an emotional investment into politics and ultimately harmed our personal lives. Do not think is significantly. There are only two parties in. Neither of those parties meaningfully represent the interests of people who have been oppressed. I think trump represents a whole new house, but because he's independent, they all hate them.

Speaker 4:          01:47:36       Everybody hated trump. Doesn't know my average except for the American people. If you could ask these people, I in trump, like trump being hated an independent. It doesn't help ordinary people because he's. He's, he's, he's bringing jobs back to America. We were selling our soul overseas and we were there teaching us to hate being American. That teaching on industrializing are actually factories and manufacturing. Jobs are coming back and people don't really true though, because you know how they let you work in politics more than I do. You know, it's like a game. You know, there's not a lot of truth in that world alive aside. Well, I, I, it's not that different. That's why I travel six days a week and I traveled to every state, even to Hawaii. The love and comfort in your life. Who looks after you? I can't, I can't. She snapped her.

Speaker 4:          01:48:23       You know, her name is bear. Hey, bear really have so much in common. Well, yes, but also my bear will beat your barrier. Disagree? I don't think so because he's like a mad woman for cat or fast. She left. Ally takes out a wall at the top of the top of the food chain because you know what the problem is? Is that a, um, that dog is a painting. Well, I'm not gonna get into the dock. We've got sandwiched. Painted nails. Important though. We should maybe another time. One of these days when people. Are you pretty strong when them people are protesting, you know, your career, your, uh, like I've watched some videos where there's people protesting the back and stuff. You hold yourself together world. Oh yeah. They're totally like insane. But then you feel like, why don't, why don't you feel like this is what I feel like I watched, like right when people, because I'm fascinated and I kind of admire the bravery I got to say that.

Speaker 4:          01:49:17       Um, but do not feel like that you want to receive and give love to people. Does that not, is that not sort of high on your agenda? No, of course it is. And I do. I received so much love because once people have this political awakening, um, and they realized that everything has been sold to them as lie. Nothing feels better than self empowerment. Actually feeling like you can do it when it comes within you, you know, he is a strong emotion but doesn't feel as good as love. You know, saying my life sucks because of all of you. It doesn't feel as good as saying I can do anything. Of course when you mean personal value, but like, but like that is not the clearest and most obvious manifestation manifestation of love from my family. Do you? That's good. Because the most obvious manifestation of love that I can think of is to accept and understand other people that people have had different experiences to you in life and that of course, and I accept that we're always going to have different experiences.

Speaker 4:          01:50:10       That's called life. You can't create a system where everybody is equal. It doesn't exist in module ring, right? It just doesn't exist. That's utopia there though before we got the fire station. But yeah, I mean I, I look for love in my personal life. I don't look for love in my, in my political life. I understand that when you know your why should, why should the political will be exempted. We're human beings because what I, what I am doing is giving them the power to go into their personal lives and, and, and feel cold beer candies is what you're actually doing is wrangling them into this, into sort of a corralling them into a position where the most powerful people in the world can continue to benefit from them. Because whilst I agree that there are bogus sort of lefty, Democrat people that contribute a lot to the debate and I don't support the sort of the, the mainstream media and the narratives that they put forward in like the cuffs in new arguing very articulately and brilliantly with people, I feel that the most people, powerful people in the world will benefit if other.

Speaker 4:          01:51:11       If people believe in individual power, people do need to collect the virus to challenge power is the only way we can ever change the collectivization. That's the APP. I believe that that's a terrible, terrible thing for community is what we fall. Even communities, of course by collectivism, collectivism leads to communism. So I think it's important to acknowledge the individuals to be the same as the big argument is we don't have to be defined by our history that we can create new futures, so collective and community based ideologies need and automatically lead to state communism in the Gulag. For me though, I only spent 10 minutes and I thought it was going quite well. We had a lovely Democrat community.

Speaker 4:          01:51:55       You did okay, but you, you couldn't, you couldn't, you know, say what the role of government was going to be and I'm telling you, look it, it's, it's hard to say with the snowflakes, okay, you and I meditate. We're not special. Snowflakes were not original. Every system has turned into nuts. It's been. It's been trying to be a blizzard. Storm, snow cats where you are. There's no question. That's what I am. Very, very wonderful bug. Think you must be a bit more kind to people. Compassionate for people that feel like in my face, calling me a white supremacist. It's not nice to Shriek at people. I agree with you to find compassion in my belly when I'm being shrieked and called the white supremacists. Somebody read a guardian or don't get angry. What did our Lord do? He fat. Forgive them. They know not what they do.

Speaker 4:          01:52:48       Forgiveness, endless forgiveness, endless love. I do love life. You've been put in a position of power. Then you have an obligation to be loving. That's your first obligation, right? Not to be a practical because I don't think you've been given her enough love in this grand. Sounds absolutely amazing that when you're a little kid, I don't mean now all that crap in the media and I love it. Sounds amazing. Yeah. But with this guy, I know my grandma who passed Nola, Nolan rock sound terrific. People such, you know, like they say that they're there. Um, well because I was trying to assert control in my life and, and that was the way that I dealt with it. But I mean I have. What about other people who have gotten a wreck? Shit. What'd you start to them back up? You wouldn't say that. No, I understand it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:34       Obviously on a more. In the same way that you would understand drug addiction on a more molecular level because you've lived it. I would tell them that they need to identify what they're trying to control. When I'm talking to drug addicts, I say this, some were wearing new. You do not think that you are beautiful. You have been hurt. There is a way out of this pain for spiritual connection to one another through service, through higher ideals, to recognize your own beauty and to realize it. That's the sort of thing, and I have to say to them, right, it's not God different though. I'm sure it is. I don't. I can't give that pep speech. They look at you and they'd be like, yeah, no, they'd be the anorexics. I've never known such complexity. Yeah, it's very complex. It really is, but I have to believe that love is more important than hate.

Speaker 4:          01:54:18       That unity and togetherness. More powerful than individually, but it. But once you. Once you. You have to empower anybody videos. I do not want to be the same person that you are. I don't want to be treated like where the same person. I don't want to be the same person that a person around me is. I don't want to be treated as if we're the exact same person and you can cookie cut society and say, Oh, this is what Qantas likes for breakfast, so that must be. We're all just going to have the same cereal for breakfast. I don't like that we are individuals. You should celebrate the individual. The individual should come together and form a community that takes care of issues for individuals. I can't take care of themselves. That's a good idea. Now this, um, would you be willing if over time when human beings come up with better ideas, as human beings evolve, if better ideas than free market capitalism were to emerge, would you be open to those ideas?

Speaker 4:          01:55:05       I love ideas. If there was something better, a better idea then globalized free market capitalism exists in the realm of infinite possibility through which all realized it must have surely have traveled. There exists now, better ideas, ideas that are more fair, more just they are there waiting to happen, these ideas and when they arrive, which they will, you will be open to them. I will be the first person that opens my loving arms and says, come here and new idea that's going to fix everything. And then we probably just need 10, 15 minutes with my pant and be willing to in that direction. Alright, well I think we've done as much as we can given the limitations that we're obviously working with them. What do you think, candice? It's been lovely. Been good at it because we're essentially disagree on almost everything. Then agree quite strongly on some things.

Speaker 4:          01:56:03       Right. Well what is. I've just taken a step further like you actually agree with me. I'd absolutely. Everything that I'm saying you just have. You just had it plugged it in. You just haven't plugged it in to realize that it's actually a capitalist, not crony capitalism, but a capitalist society with free markets that helps with people out of poverty. It's one steps off and these massive regulation. We've seen the results of that walk in, walk in, and then I took one step and you're here and I'm like, come back to us. So hopefully I helped you a little bit. See what can you wish your absolutely charming. That was amazing. Thank you. Fucking

Speaker 5:          01:56:44       awesome.
