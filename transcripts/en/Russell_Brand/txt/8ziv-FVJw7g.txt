Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ed stafford is a survivalist explorer and adventurer, an internationally acclaimed motivational speaker and author who has been described as Britain's most intrepid hero since Scott of the Antarctic. He's experienced extremes all over the world and is the Guinness World record holding first man to walk the Amazon. Ed splits his life between filming around the world and spending time at home in London. He blogs about anything related to adventure, remote travel and health and fitness. Ed Stafford, frank, you for very much for coming on under the skin. Absolute pleasure. What fascinates me most about your work as a sort of a survivalist or an adventurer is the way that you talk about the, uh, sort of conscious and spiritual component of surviving in extreme situations, but in a way your background is traditional in the sense that you're from the military, is straight into the skin then, isn't it really? Uh, I, I think so. I mean, I've always thought it was, um, I'm, I'm in the world of adventure. Have done it off the back of a military career.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       And yet, for me, the sort of the obvious parts of adventure that crossing rivers, climbing mountains, sort of toughing it out, don't, don't really interest me as merchant the psychological aspects. Clearly I think, um, you know, there is a very physical element in everything I do, but the whole thing since the military onwards has been, uh, has been a bit of a spiritual journey. And, and it's just, it's, it's interesting for me how such a sort of stereotypical blokey bloke's job has ended up being actually one which has been quite, um, quite okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       Sort of spiritual journey. Yeah. That is fascinating. That's perhaps what fascinates me most. Was that something that it a superficially seems to be about over modes of masculinity such as toughness, insurance, survival optimally in your view, comes down to our spirituality. I think. I think it's evolved at the most. I think

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       when I started, when I, for example, wanted to walk the length of the Amazon, I think there was a lot of ego involved. I think I really wanted to prove to the world that I was super turf, beat my chest and um, do something that everyone was saying was impossible. And so, um, in fact that really annoyed me, you know, everyone said, no, you're going to die, or they laughed at me or they didn't think it was possible and I was just like, I'm just going to prove him wrong. It was literally a two finger salute to, to those sort of naysayers. And I think, um, just because it started in quite a sort of a macho way, I suppose it's taken me by surprise, the journey it's taken me on because there's nothing macho about what I do is the moment, you know, it, I really don't need to prove anything to anyone.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       And again, maybe this is just an age thing. I'm 41 now. So I think as you get older you don't need to show off quite as much as he did as a kid. But um, but, um, yeah, certainly I think that what I'm doing now is quite a, it's quite meaningful and, and I don't, I don't know, it, it keeps me learning. It keeps me in a position of being quite humble as well. When you were in the military, my superficial and inexperienced intuitive understanding of life in the military is that a must be extremely testing on you physically and mentally and it must be a lot about making individuals behave in a cohesive way and respond well to all 40. What was that like for you as an individual? What would you like for your mental health at the time you spent in the army?

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       And if I'm honest, I don't think I, um, I took to the army at all. Well I'm a joins because I wanted to roll around in the burden throughout an outdoor job and not sit behind a desk. And, and in that respect it's always correct, but I never really. There's a fear that I don't know whether you understand when we even see a military camp and all that barbwire around the outside. When I go into Cam, I would get properly scared inside on the left as a captain. You shouldn't arguably be scared of the campus if you're, if you're, if you're at that level. Um, and yet I did a, it was a very disciplined environment. It was a very strict environment and it is one that is run on, run on discipline and, and, um, sort of regime. And that wasn't me at all.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Um, I might have taken a lot from the military, but I've always been quite a free spirit and I've always liked the ability to do what I want to do and get up in the morning and I'd like to plan my own day rather than, you know, for the next six months in advance has been planned for you. And so it was never really me. Even in training at Santa Stowe was not counting the days til I finished training, which the other recruits were. I was counting the days to actually could leave the military because I could tell it wasn't really. And yet it was something I almost did as a of finishing school and all, it's given me the skills I needed to do what I'm doing now. How did you flourish in an environment that was so counter to the way you wanted to be in the way you saw yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       How did you, because you obviously succeeded, you've got to the rank of captain. How many years were you in the military? I was, I was in for four years. I didn't flourish if I'm honest. Um, I, I, I feel like I've come into myself in more recent years. I'm in my early thirties rather than I'm in my mid twenties. Was, was when I was in the military. I remember telling my commanding officer that I was gonna leave and he just smiled and said, yeah, that's probably best, isn't it? I mean, I literally, I wasn't that good because I think, I don't think I was into it, you know, I didn't have any interest in guns. You know, people go on Stag do's to Las Vegas and she just leaves me cold. I'm not interested in. I did spend time in Afghanistan and the other consultants, they were, um, they couldn't wait to decommission the weapons off the Afghans so they could go into the middle of the, into the middle of the desert and shoot bazookas and stuff and that I just, it's just not me at all. And invariably you can bluff your case for a little while and then after awhile reached the rank of captain and the thought, this is about as senior as I want to go. Bluff in my case, I'm sure there's more to life as well. With the battalion was going back to Northern Ireland for two more years and doing a really quite difficult

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       jobs to keep the soldiers motivated in those sort of environments. And so I decided it was time to leave. What I personally, I have tremendous respect for anybody that can endure the military because when I imagined myself in those kinds of environments, when you took right individuality in a, a necessity respond to discipline. That makes me feel really scared. And the idea that you said about the camp, but I also have this sense that the military, you'd refer to it as a finishing school, might be a place where greatness is accessed in that you are tested as an individual and like the whether or not you can overcome and some mount certain challenges. Is that fair? Is that what it was like in some ways in retrospect?

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       Yeah. A lot of the explorers around the world have been in the military, a runoff fines and you know, all of the people who have made a name for themselves. And I think there is a reason for that. I think it gave me a set of skills. It gave me not just the physical skills packing a work site and navigating those sort of very obvious wounds, but also it allowed me to think flexibly, bizarrely. And you'd think that the military would be quite, um, regimented with the way it thinks. But they have got this thing called mission command, which essentially means if you know the end state of what you're trying to achieve. So your commanding officers told you the end state, it's up to you as to how you do it and um, so it does allow a lot of flexibility, conquer that area or get you to that place, attack that trench and it's up to you as to whether you go, you know, through the stream, straight up the middle or around the forest and to recover or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       So enjoyable. That side of things. I think when I came out, when I started leading expeditions, it was good to be able to know that I could deal with situations and I can be flexible. So I did massively have to take my military hat off in many respects because, you know, a lot of the people that I was dealing with were local people, indigenous people from potentially third world countries. And you can't just go in there with your sort of army hat on telling people what to do or expecting things to run like clockwork because it just, you'll just end up exploding out of sheer frustration. So I had to completely take that off trip, chuck it all away quite frankly. And, and, and I, I'm happy to share that side of the military, you know, as I go on year by year, the military has less and less influence over who I am today. Definitely.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Did it, did you, while you were in the military question the agenda and the objectives and this I suppose that inherently what is within military is, uh, the idea of force, the idea of coercion, the idea of control. So there are a lot of things like on a, on the level of our national identity, we have to conceal about the role of the military. I'm not talking to individual soldiers who is very, very brave that anyone's prepared to put himself through that kind of suffering and I admire them, but I'm talking about like the sort of the political objectives of a military organization, for example in Northern Ireland. And we'll just take one very complex subject to that sort of stuff. Trouble you.

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       Um, I think, um, I never really believed in the Northern Ireland occupation, you know, when we're out there. And that was therefore difficult to put on a and official face. I was in charge of 30 soldiers. They were looking to me to sort of, um, lead them through this, through this experience of occupying a another nation, you know, and okay, we weren't fighting, but you know, we were unwanted there, you know, I was spit in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       Really? You're kidding me. You've had that happen. Of course,

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       of course. Every and every British army soldier that's, that's done any patrols in Northern Ireland would have had that happen. What? But if you think about it, if it was your back yard and suddenly observation Qataris are going up and people are spying on your houses and stuff, you'd be pretty outraged to. And so I don't feel any negativity towards anything.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       No people that did that. I didn't believe in what I was doing if I didn't deliver. So that must be. I imagine it'd be hard enough if you, if one had the mentality of queen and country and the right of the British Empire to Ra and occupy other territory. So it would still be out if someone spit in your face. But if you sort of felt it was wrong anyway, did it just feel like the physical representation of your own doubts?

Speaker 2:          00:10:00       I think. I think if you sign up for some things sometimes, and this is really tricky, isn't it? Because when you, because everyone. Well I've developed over the course of years and ability to tell whether something's right or wrong by sort of trusting my gut, you know, intuitively know whether you should be doing something that didn't. And Yeah, I'd signed up to an organization which it's got nothing to do with feelings or intuition. It was just literally this is your orders and this is what you've got to do. And I kind of just, I've got to admit, I kind of just accepted that this is a role that you've got to fulfill for the next year or two years or whatever. And once you've done it, you can. Then you can then break free and live your life as you want to do it. So I think I just sucked it up and got on with it

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       at the time. I wouldn't go back to it now. I said, what was it then? So having been schooled, hardened, trained, taught by the military, or how was it that you found yourself attracted to the seemingly impossible? Uh, I know that you were strongly advised against trying to walk the Amazon not least because it's made of water and then new cheeses can do that, that you know, that you were at five today, these were insurmountable challenges. What, what happened to you in a period from leaving the military term, taking on these great physical and psychological trials? What, what made you think you could do it and why did you want to do?

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       I think as much as the military, it, I didn't get on with it for the reasons that I've explained what I did like is being outdoors and what I did like his physical challenges and, and um, and spending time next to nature, I've got to be honest. And so the first job I took when coming out of the military was taking gap year kids on, um, on trips into the rain forest. So they were building a new visitor center for National Park or something. And you know, 18 to 24 year olds, they're having a life changing experience and I got the chance to use the knife skills that come out with the military, have been able to take them into the jungle safely. There'd be sleeping in hammocks and Washington rivers and maybe doing a project which has got an ecological aim or community based Damon.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       And that was, it was perfect as far as I was concerned. I was living at almost, you know, I've got paid next to nothing for that job because it was charity work, but it was using all the really nice touchy feely part of it was taking the, it was taking the army or expedition knowledge and actually putting it to good purpose. So, you know, there were, there was always a conservation or, or community aim and mission to, to each one of the expeditions. And I flourished in that environment. I loved it. I did it for about eight or nine years actually. And um, and really enjoyed it. What did you learn during that? Well, it was more, obviously I'm not ordering people around paying volunteers coming on these trips. And it was, um, it was more just about letting go of all of the, all of the worries and all of the fears that have, that I'd had building, being in the military.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Suddenly people are all around me, were having an amazing life changing experiences. And you know, if when you pull people into the jungle like that and everyone's wearing the same grubby trousers and shirt and you know, there's, there's no fashion, there's no phones, there's everything stripped away. And yet people, almost every single person on these expeditions at the time would have said, this has been the most amazing thing I've ever done in my life because they come together. They bond, they weren't really hard. They're living in this almost like a commune in the middle of it, in the middle of the jungle. And it, I think it was extraordinarily rewarding. It taught people, you know, what life's about, how to look after each other, how to work as a team. And it was, it was a youth development charity as well. So it was all about these people who probably didn't know anything about life.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       And this is the first time they've properly traveled away from home, but they've done it in quite a safe, organized way because it's led by someone like me who is ex military. But um, I don't know. It almost. Yeah. Almost every single person that I'm in contact with, a lot of the volunteers that came on those trips, just, it literally, it changed their attitudes towards each other, change their attitudes towards nature, and they've got a huge amount of it. People began to feel connected when they talk to each other and to nature and to who they really are, I suppose with what we ca. What's implicit in that is that living in a civilized culture disconnects you from yourself. One Star, two star, or we start to form attachments to material objects to things that aren't real. Like the way that we envisage people isn't investigated for when people are put into an environment that is stripped back, the reason they feel so grateful, so connected is because they discover some kind of truth.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       And I suppose the spirituality in essence is about the discovery of truth and the fact that the car. But the truth is beautiful. The truth is connection, not alienation. Last despair. Yeah. And I think you hit the nail on the head by saying it's not really. I wasn't adding anything. I was just stripping stuff away. So yeah, all the nonsense, all of the phones, all of the distractions, all of the, you know, things that will turn to when we're not feeling good drugs, cigarettes, chocolate, whatever it is. There aren't any of those, you know, and everyone was having to deal with a very raw version of each other. And I think that was lovely for star and you know, back in the day people used to tell stories didn't and you know, we would light a fire in the evening and cook on it and then sit around and chat to each other. There was nothing else to do. And so you're looking up at the stars you're contemplating. And it was again, a world stripped away of the nonsense, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       Yeah. Well, his trip to have a nonsense means that people go within themselves, but I don't imagine it's just plain sailing or sort of, you know, sort of a communal trumpton about people go through a lot of English, don't they? I mean I filled a part of. I'm very attracted to what you do. I admire it very much, but it's with myself. There's quite a lot of fear in there. If I think right, you've got to go and live in the woods. You're not going to have your phone. You're not gonna have a lot. There's a phrase, isn't there? We become prisoners of comfort. I feel that I am in many ways a prisoner of comfort that I have not tested myself. I used to do this thing and this seems like a mad thing to tell her survival explorer because it's so lightweight, but like I went to, went out with this woman who had an amazing state in the grounds of the estate was a well beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       Well the east stinking marsh pond. Right? And I have to jump in it. Right. And when you jump in it, it was really cold. It was freezing. Then when you got in there, when I got in there, I go there and I'd think well like that my body is capable not only of experiencing that cold but also capable of making that noise and all the time they are not experiencing that code on making that noise. I'm disconnected from the guy that can handle that. So I'm like bobbing about just on the surface of who I am. Never experiencing the truth of just as me as an individual on a sort of an anatomical, physical and essential way. So imagining that in that is a tiny pipsqueak scrap of the thing that you're

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       in a right that you think. I think. I think you're right. I mean there's A. There's a movement at the moment I'm with amongst disillusion people working in London called going on a micro adventure and people will literally sort of five to nine I think is the catchphrase. They'll leave work at five. They'll take a train out into the countryside though, run up a hill, sleep on top of a hill in the morning, go and jump in a river and then get it back on the train and being for work the next day and I think that's quite indicative of the, of, of just people not being satisfied with this kind of mundane life and they want to eat really experienced life and obviously it's uncomfortable sleeping on the hill, it's know bloody cold jumping into the water and none of these things that are actually conventionally good fun and yet it somehow does press a reset button. It somehow does enable them to go in the next day to work with a smile on their face and feeling like they've actually done something and it's very difficult to actually explain why they're doing it. But I'm certainly, I feel there is more to life than just, I don't know, getting on the tube and going to work and sitting at a desk. I'm not interested in being a number like that. I want to experience as much of life as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       So like in a way we can sort of build an idea that urbanization, industrial industrialization and the technological society is a way of turning people into kind of the fuel for giant factory. Your role just becomes to, as a producer and as a consumer in many cases more a consumer than a producer. Your connection to nature and reality has been severed. You're on the tube, but you're saying that these micro adventures are examples of people have this yearning for what's real. And Are you saying that this year and any something you always add that you felt I don't want to do some job where I'm basically in some version of prison

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       and I'm trying to. I reckon I reckon feelings more personally now, I reckon feeling is more important than than thought. And I think we all get lost in our heads. You know, we all anxieties, fears, all this sort of nonsense going on in our heads all the time. And I think what I'm talking about is just experiences which sometimes aren't logical. Why am I going to go in jumping out stream the. It's having a very, very visceral experience. It's certainly shocking or your body senses it's making you feel alive again, and it's, and it's very hard to describe logically. And I've got, I've got some really, really good aboriginal Australian friends and um, and they went toe to me, is that, in fact, the first time I met this guy, he's like, um, we sat in the car, nobody sat in the room for about five minutes and obviously thinking about those things, I know of two, five minutes he went and will you shut the fuck up?

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       Because there were so many thoughts going around my brain. And like from an aboriginal perspective, they'll try and tell this story quite shortly. But he, they believe that, um, you've got three brains, the biggest brain being your, your gut and your instincts. The second biggest brain being your heart and your emotions in the smallest brain being the logical brain and the word that they use to describe the logical brain is called Nando. Nando is also the word that they use to describe a fishing net that was all tangled beyond repair or fucked in their words. And that's the word they used to describe the logical brain and they said the reason that western people confused live so much is that they live in this logical brain and it, it's a tool. Everything is meant to start. And the guy, you know, all of your, everything that you do or the way you live, your life is all starts down here and okay, it gets filtered by your heart and your emotions and then it Latin.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       It gets filtered in the lesser manner by your logic and your and your logical brain. But this for me immediately explained it. It just made everything click into place. He's like, it's not that, that's not going to place. It has, it's a filter on the way out. But everything has to originate. And you know, all sorts of expressions. We've got expressions in our, in our own culture, you know, you follow your gut, but they, they really genuinely believe. And I, I have to admit, I have taken on the same bullish. I think everything should originate. And I the thing you know, to live your life in an urban society where you're constantly watching the clock and you're in time and stresses and all this sort of stuff, it's all in your head isn't. And all they were doing was to try and tell me, and I did it because I was going to go put myself on a desert island.

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       So I thought they will be good people to speak to about this. And they said, the more you live in your head, the more problems you will have. The more anxieties and fears and doubts. And they were absolutely right. The more you can come from an instinctual place, it's all of that. It just evaporates in and you can live in, you can, you can have a decent time on the island. Paris, great wisdom. How did you go from being the man in a car that's like baptist? I shut the fuck up too because you're thinking too loudly. How did you. What did you learn from them and how do you do that? And it's been a long journey. I mean the Amazon was two and a half years that time isolated completely. I'm earned on the island was 60 days, which is a long time in complete isolation was 60 days in complete isolation.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       Well, I'll be completely honest. I was l twice and twice. They sent in a because I had a satellite phone to call in case there was twice. They brought in course of antibiotics but then left me again. But other than what did you feel like in the moments when someone drops off the antibiotics? He talked to me. Hold me. You would think. I would think that I got angry at myself immediately. I called use the satellite phone. I got angry that I was breaking this sort of a rule that you'd say, you know, I was going to have 60 days in isolation and you know, why didn't you call? What is that? Well, because I'm not a doctor. I didn't know what was wrong. I was like, what were you experiencing? Cramps and pains, which I think the first one was trapped when something so in a, and yet I'd obviously got myself and it's very difficult to describe. I don't know whether you've spent extended periods of time in isolation. No, may bucks. Ten minutes. I started free out, but it's far from a, from a spiritual perspective. It was one of the most, one of the biggest catalyst I think I've ever experienced because there was nowhere to hide. It was, um, it was like a mirror to yourself, but, you know, I couldn't distract myself in any way because there was nobody else there that it was almost like the enormity of just being in my own presence was, um, was overwhelming enormity.

Speaker 2:          00:22:58       Okay. I think it's again, quite difficult to explain, but, um, I think we all live our lives and I certainly used to in a way where you bounce off other people. So I, you know, in this interview, I'm constantly reading signals off year in order to get an interpretation of how I'm behaving, you know, uh, the fact that the producer next to me, it isn't, you know, jumping up and down. It's like, okay, things are going okay so I can continue to live my life in this way, strip all of that feedback away so it's just you certainly your sense of self is like, well, who am I? Because nobody's giving me any reflective sense of who I am and almost vomiting on the bees. Genuinely. I was almost sad because, oh, the concept of who I was just evaporated and I was scared that she stole all the hairs on the end of I thought, who am I?

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       And then other people provide your parameters if there's no feedback, no bounce back. Who are you? I just had the image Ed of light that the self being like a radiator radiant radiate in our energy in imagery, and if that secret, no, never gets bounced back. It's limitless. It's infinite. Once I met this man in America is a cowboy. I think it was around the Co. Yeah, and he said once there's only so much horizon a man can stand either. If there's just endless horizon, it's going on forever and no one's telling You who you are and you start to think as you were saying, how am I? So what happens next?

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       Okay, so now I did. I'd love to say that the penny dropped on the island, but it didn't at all. It was afterwards. But for you going from extreme anguish, then someone's on that island. It was, it was a knife edge of, of. I was so filming a project for the discovery channel. It was, I was also going through this sort of isolation, um, well, extreme effects of being put in sort of solitary confinement. Solitary confinement is a punishment in a prison for a reason. Well, okay. Again, long story short, I came off the island, didn't have any sort of decompression therapy or anything like that. And then about a year later was meant to be filming another series for, for discovery. And I couldn't get out of bed. I was crying. I was, um, my, my courage. It was through the floor. And um, again, long story short, but I went into therapy and I, I, I found out because he invariably, when you do go through therapy, get this sort of terminology for certain things and what I, the way I've lived my life they term as a reflected sense of self.

Speaker 2:          00:25:27       But what they tried to engender with emea was my own sense of self. So united. So you okay. I'm not the concept of there being a horizon being you can only take so merge and again, the isolation being so enormous. It's only because I was, I was, I could only feel comfortable when I was getting reflected sensitive self if you have sense of self is coming from the inside. Because for example, I had just started developing a moral compass, you know, if I was to steal your pen and walk out today, it's not a big thing but I wouldn't do it anymore because it won't feel good about myself. But it doesn't matter whether you're new or whether like I don't. I now live my life in a really honest way. And I think having to strip it back and work out, work out who I was was about what I stand for as well.

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       So I won't steal off you and I won't cheat and I won't lie. And I think that's the only true way to actually really know who you are as a person. It doesn't matter what anyone else knows or understands or can find out or anything like that. And I now go, okay, I can sit here knowing who I am, knowing that I've now emotionally mature enough to I have a wife and have a kid and stuff like that because I know who I am. Whereas if it was all based on how I think I'm coming across to, that becomes extraordinarily complicated very quickly. And I was in this chap and I would honestly say that I walked the amazon so that other people would say to me, mate, your fucking incredibly tough, tough because they told me I would

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       investment in a way it's bonkers. And so many people do live their life in that way. And it's just like, you know, coming from that true sense of self, it really, you really have to dig down deep to find out who you are and what you do stand for. I think there's a thing that. Yeah, you're right. I think there's a thing called codependency, you know, like in 12 step circles, meaning that your identity is a meshed with other people's identity and perception of you. Now. That thing you just described of like needing the feedback and approval of others. I feel like we have a culture that's fueled on that, that everyone's running on. Who am I? What do I want? Oh, I am my phone, I am my shoes, I am my job. I am not. My wife thinks of me. I'm just describing myself now.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       For me, my journey has been about having like becoming an addict and haven't let go of drugs. I was addicted to then behaviors that I was addicted to them. Ways of treating people that, you know, all these things have had to be sort of slowly let go of. What you realize is those things are doing a job for you. They're holding you together. So what? I'm fascinated in the way that you have physicalized and extreme eyes, if that's a word, like I like those, that principle by, you know, like what say data. Like you're saying the whole of the island experience was. Didn't bring about tiffany. You came back from the island and sort of had a mental breakdown.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Yeah, I mean, crikey. I think being kind to myself, I would have had to be pretty superhuman person to do all of that self evaluation and come to those sort of aha moments and film program for discovery channel and find food and water and all the other things. There was only so much I could do. I mean it opened a can of worms, but I didn't manage. I didn't manage to come to any sort of massive life conclusions. I think I'm certainly not critical if you decide if you made a real mess of that time. Yeah. But I mean, it's weird, isn't it again, because people who said to me, you know that Ireland was conducive to you being able to survive. There was no better mistakes. Food, we've plentiful because you had coconuts and stuff. Why did you make such a meal of it and yet you've clearly never been isolated, have you? And cranky some people manage it really well. You know, there's ocean rowers who go longer than I spent on the island and have absolute, you know, problem is with falling apart. It must

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       be very strongly connected to purpose and direction. I reckon the only way, luckily since obviously purely speculative in my sense in except for this yet another micro example once I to do this stunt where it's a full backwards off of a 30 foot feeling into some crash mats. Right. And I was so scared of doing it that the only way I could persuade myself to do it was by focusing on the small details of put your foot there. Then put there and do tell him exactly what the stunt man told me in that moment with my religion, like I do these things and that way that the fear could be navigated by the coordinates of instruction. I've been offered. So on that island, the way you what? What were you like? I was thinking possibly the fact that you act to find food and keep yourself alive would have been in a sense, structuring the experience, giving you st hold onto. In fact.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       Yeah, I think you're absolutely bang on and actually that's I think the, what I wear, what I came to thInk afterwards is that because I didn't have a, a lateral g, you know, journey from a to b, there wasn't anything to strive for. It was literally your plankton and Ireland and you've got to with yourself and there is nobody, there is no time pressure. There is, you know, the no desperation to get food because it's all around you. And so. And that was part of the problem. It was just like, this isn't about achieving anything. This is about you just becoming comfortable with yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Can I ask you candidly what coping mechanisms city developed? BecauSe I know that like for me it'd be, that'd be, that'd be obsessive about food. I think masturbation would become an issue. I think I would find things that were like controlling my states of mind. Were there things, because you said he vomited. I mean, that was obviously very physicalized did things like. I know it's a very plain and roots question, so I saw on ebay masturbation, but one of the things he did, things like that become that, or at least I can tell you that or did that quickly become quite redundant?

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       Well, let's tackle that one first. No, see the one that interests me and I didn't. I didn't masturbate once in the ocean and so it didn't occur to me one. I think when you're malnourished, your testosterone goes down. You aren't thinking in that way. I don't know whether it's something to do with times of famine. People weren't procreating because there wasn't enough food around so that it doesn't affect your libido. Definitely. Although it would've been a good distraction. You're roy. I just, I kind of put it out of my brain as well. I don't know why, but I, you know, you can imagine this. I remember. Okay. Studying for my a levels, for example, I would have done quite a lot and you can eat it. You feel grabby, don't you? Have yOu been doing that all the time? I didn't really want that to be the, uh, the focus of my, of my paradise, a man alone

Speaker 3:          00:31:43       with god now type for a while, those coconuts together and this seashell here

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       I do, you know what I did because I was so scared of spending time on my own and spending time with myself. I again, this, this is a really crude way of doing it, very involved or uninvolved, but I wouldn't do It today, but I made my self so busy that I didn't have time to sit with myself. So for example, I decided I'd build a shelter and I'd literally say, well, okay, I could get up in the morning and I make myself a little cup of tea of on, but I'm going to get, allow 15 minutes for that and then I'm going to go to work and I'm going to spend two hours at work and then at mid morning on a comeback and I have a tiebreaker and I literally scheduled out the day. so I didn't have any time. And reflectively. I've definitely think that's because I was so scared of those times when I was just reflecting when I was just sitting with myself. So I, I kept myself extraordinarily busy

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       to get around that. So you want your survival technique, it mentally busy. What happened? Yeah. Excuse me. When you did find yourself alone, what is the, what was the quality of the fear? What the, uh, the fear in the light, you know, what did you think? Oh, I'm not a good enough person. I made mistakes when I was a kid. I hate that. I hate most of what was sort of, what were the frightening things that happened in your mind?

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       Okay. Again, this is far from a sub story too, and everybody's got their own story. Everyone's got stuff that gives some issues. last year with a knife and familiar was adoption. Um, I was a kid and um, I didn't understand this for many years and I got up to buy very, very loving middle class family. I got sent to a good school and I have no, this is not a sob story to however, there's a theory that, um, why do you think you have to keep saying it's not a sob story? Because I'm not as. I don't want to maple sympathy and that's not what I'm telling him. I'm telling it because it's, I think because it's um, it doesn't, it kind of all doesn't make sense unless you go, well, hang on. Why? Why were you insecure? Why did you need to prove these things? and personally I think that came from adoption.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       Does it? Uh, can you explain it quite briefly in the photos? It is a theory that a baby, when it's born to move the, the biggest trauma it could possibly experience did the equivalent of death is being separated from his mother because it can't feed itself and it can't do anything to separate those two things. On a very, very core level, you are experienced the trauma of death and then your whole life Builds upon that, that insecurity of being abandoned essentially. So I had huge abandonment issues and that would spill out and all sorts of different ways, um, school and you know, getting expelled for minor acts of vandalism to in my twenties, in the military, you know, drinking and getting into trouble with plays and bits and bobs like that. And I, I just think of course every man's got, you know, testosterone and every young man spills over and gets into trouble and I think that just shows spirit.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       But for me, the deeper insecurity, the reason I needed to go to the amazon, the reason I needed to do something so big is because my insecurity was, was so deep. I suppose I just genuinely, you know, again, the whole concept of not really knowing who you are and not knowing what you stand for. I'd do anything for me, it's dare me to do anything. I literally do anything. There was no boundaries and you know, people are, you know, everyone knows people like that. There's just like, they're scary because they will do anything. Absolutely. Anything new. I definitely fell into that category. Sends you understand things like this. And the reason I think I say it's not a sob stories, because once you understand your history, it doesn't matter anymore, it's just a chapter in your life and I wouldn't actually trade and any of that for all the money in the world because it's made me who I am today and I wouldn't have achieved what I've achieved in life, probably if it stayed in the same phone and been brought up in a very conventional way. So I'm really, and let's face it, it'd be a waste of energy to be anything other than happy with everything that's happened to us because it's happened, you know, but, but therefore it's just a chapter in the book.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       It was probably a good book. It's a, it became, it became your gift. The wound became your gift, the damage, the damage of like, as you said it using your words to read. The worst thing that could have happened to baby. It can be separated from the mother that happened to you. And curiously, your life's agenda becomes, can I survive alone? That's the question naked on island.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       I don't think there's any doubt that was some sort of, um, self so, so fulfilled prophecy. I, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       Luck and attempt to resolve the issue, the drama of your personal metaphors. You are, I am abandoned. Well, if I'm abandoned I need to survive alone. Can I.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       And then to do that in front of however many $95 million people on discovery channel as well. I don't know. It was so deep that I somehow needed this is sometimes, which I haven't really quite got to the bottom of this way. I need to do these things publicly as well. Anything, you know, I, I fully understand that famous and it's a folly quite frankly and you know, and uh, and not a purpose within it within itself. And yeah, it's amazing. I did want to do it on a stage, you know, I want, I want to be. Would you be able to see it as well? It wasn't just an intern.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       Right. That's true. I suppose a person who's got the skills to survive and survive, but if you interesting that you raised the point that it was about community and about connection and about possibly about exhibition or demonstration and I mean in a way perhaps all of us have the same sort of need to be loved. This needs to be connected and certainly all of us have the need to somehow resolve the drama of our circumstance. That drama of our childhood. Like I must become this, I must solve there.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       She does a another again, it's a therapy sort of, um, okay terminology. But, um, does this include developmental immaturity where you don't self parent yourself? And I definitely think I fell into that category so I would, you know, drive my car at absolute maximum speed down the motorway because there was no version of myself kicking in and we all have different parts of our personality. But the adult version of myself wouldn't kick in again. And this is not a terribly good idea. Or you know, when you've had however many pints in a lot of people would go to, you know, I've had enough. Now. I'm going to go to bed and go home, whereas that and that never kicked into me. And, and apparently there is a psychological term for it, which is, yeah, and it's not far off from codependency, but you know, it's the same sort of thing which is literally just living in this childlike state thinking that, you know, you can still be abandoned thinking that you need to almost be so volatile that no one can ever reject you because you are rejecting them or by your outrageous behavior, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       And um, I think the thing that has enabled me in recent years because I got married two years ago and her little baby about six months ago and I have no worries that I'm going to be a great dad and a great father. You know, I just don't. I am, I'm, I'm doing that at the moment and don't doubt myself. But that's, I think, because I've come through this whole journey because I genuinely, I meditate every day and part of my meditation is, is literally, it's called self parenting, but it's literally holding my own hand through life really rather than neglecting the, you know, how most people go, like british people especially, they're like self love is quite a cringy term isn't it? You know, americans might say a lot, but british people, they don't want to talk about self love, you know, they take the piss out of themselves, they're far more comfortable putting themselves down or taking the piss out of themselves and they are loving themselves and I've had to do it and it sort of visualization when I meditate each day and it's just like looking after myself, being kind to myself.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       And that then enables me to stand and they'll go, rIght, I've got my values, I'm looking after myself and then I can genuinely in life go look, I'm not lying to an or not harming anyone. I mean a really good position to, you know, he loved my wife and look after my child and that sort of stuff. When did you start the meditation again? It was a therapy thing. I mean, I was offered whatever the medication was at the time, I can't remember, but at what point your life is by the way as well. And I couldn't continue filming for discovery channel because I had essentially a mini breakdown, but a year after coming off the island for 60 days, done the island, the islands of success. You come back and then when you get back to normal domestic life, everything's sort of hits you. What was that experienced? What was happening in your mind and life then?

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       I was in at the time a really, really bad relationship. So the, um, you know, the first call mode at the end of the Ireland experience was to my, at the time, um, girlfriend and we had an argument and I was just like, I can't believe that she's having a go at me 60 days. And so that relationship, I don't know, it was, um, it was, it was absolutely notes. I came back and um, I think with hindsight, you know, tv is, it's a scary thing that you go to discovery channel, you go, I'm going to put myself under the item for 60 days. And they said, well, could you survive like no knife? Nothing. And I was like, I don't know. And they go, brilliant, let's do it. Because they want to embrace it from a televisual perspective. They want to make entertainment for people. And if I struggled that would be really entertaining.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Nobody really went, yeah, but is this going to do any damage? You know, psychologically, certainly let alone the sort of physical thing or that thing. Why dId you choose six days on an island alone? Because I think I was forever sort of gravitating towards an experience where I really genuinely had to know that I could look after myself. I think it wasn't abandoned that thing. I think it was me needing to know that I was capable of, of, of survIving on their own. and I don't think that's the end state in life. You know, everyone can be as independent and as they like and have as many survival skills as ray mears, but that's not, it doesn't make you a happy person does it? I mean, I just needed to come through to the state where I was confident enough in myself as a person too. Then, you know, open my heart and, and, and embrace the people around me. But I think I need to do one first. If you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       she got back and you'd have a sort of mental breakdown and you're like, you have this argument with your then partner for africans. That relationship breaks up and you're alone

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       longer than that. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       I enjoy it. That you liked being alone would be odd for you after you've done 60 days on an island to think that you're alone. Proof.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       I know people and you know, I really, you know, the best times in life have always been shared moments they've never been. When I'm completely on my own, I don't think I can pick a moment when I've. Okay. Sometimes if we're on a run or something, but even that isn't. I'm going to have your endorphins are going through your mind, but it's in a certain parameters whereby you know you're going to come home and again, the people that you love and it. But I think in general you choose to do the big moments of your life with the people that you love. Wouldn't you choose to spend millennium christmas, new year's eve with you know, your best mates or whatever, and I think that's what life's about for me. Family, friends, that sort of stuff. But you've got to get yourself right first

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       to have a meaningful input to their family and friends. I think my book about 12 steps and the 12 steps themselves from which the book is derived. It's about how you go on a journey to be able to be part of a community by addressing these issues without going around Ireland for 60 days. But by going in yourself and knowing that you're probably being motivated by things that you don't understand and that's why you have to drink and that's why you have to take drugs and that's why you have to gamble. Or that's why you're shopping too much or that's why you're in bad relationships, so that's why you're doing your job. You don't like because you've never ever asked yourself the question. You've never stopped and done something as transformative or ritualistic as being alone. I mean like the idea of isolation. It's a religious idea, isn't it? That in a monastic cultures, and I bet in them aboriginal cultures that were they able to go? Yeah, we did sound a bit like that. Anyway. We're a 15 year old boys sloughing off and talked to survive.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       They do, don't they? They go walkabout and you know, one of the absolute aboriginal traditions is, is to go off as a young man on your own and spend extended periods of time in the bush on your own and you know, that is a part of how they evolve into a man. And I think that's no coincidence. So either I think, you know, for me, I didn't need to sit there without any of the distractions. Addictions are not anything in life that distracts you from just being able to sit with yourself. And I think it's hugely important. If you don't quite know who you are, if you've always like, people are so busy at work for example, and then they come home and because there is that time, in theory, my brain gets switched off now, but that will be. Or I could stop thinking about stuff, but that would be a bit scary. They'll have a glass of wine and it's just, I need either to be stupidly busy or to numb my brain, but the other bit, you know, that actually just sitting in

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       and feeling how I'm genuinely feeling. That'S the scary bit. Holding reality being in reality. So who was it that during this time of crisis suggested meditation to you and how did you get into that? It was, um,

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       it was a neuro linguistic programming lady who was operating in called malecon who operated from a little little clinic in knightsbridge I think at the time. And um, I didn't really get on with the neuro linguistic programming, but she goes, look, this, this app is for cynics, you know, and it's just a, it's called headspace. Went by a guy who, who used to come from bristol a thing. And he's a sports science guy, but he, he had dodgy part of his life and he went off and became a, um, of buddhist monk and spent a huge amount of his time actually studying meditation and I think it has, I mean hezbollah has earned him millions now. It's, it's big in New York. It's, it's, it's as big a lot of countries all over the world, but it's, it's the meditation without the justice and the, you know, the chanting and singing had an.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       And I needed it to be accessible at that stage because if We rewind a few years I was, I was very ex military and so I would have taken the mickey out of people who told me that I'd be meditating daily, you know, now for 10 years ago I would have gone. That's just ridiculous. I just have a pint, you know, do believe in god. I don't reAlly like the sort of religious structure put around. I believe in something bigger than me. Then I suppose the, my, my belief is the, the closest to it. I think that I can describe it as the guy or principle, you know, the concept of the earth acting like a living organism and therefore there is something positive happening that's bigger than me that is taking things on a, on a positive journey that has an interest in things going well and people functioning together and operating as a, as an, as a cohesIve unit. And I think for me that's not religion. I think it's quite a crude way of people trying to use the smallest brain, the logical brain to actually put sort of parameters on something that you can't really talk about. But it, it's, I believe in something bigger than him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       There is some sort of harmonious connection that these aboriginal mentors and tutors that you found and made use of. What is your understanding of what their spirituality is based on?

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       Well, very similar. I mean it's the universe. It's, um, I mean they believe that their ancestors are still around, which I think sometimes the way it was described to me is that your, if your life is like if you were a jug of water and you put it in one drop of water falls out of the jug of water back into another job at the bottom, your life, you feel like you're an individual entity while you're that drop of water, but you're just coming from,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       uh, the, the sort of a source and you're going straight by two and, and, and I think that's how they feel. I mean, I certainly know that jeremy and my aboriginal friends, they, they, they talk about communicating with the ancestors and they, they, um, and they, they walk in, they have a foot in, in more than one world. And um, and I think they believe in the universe. I think they believe in the positive forces of the planet. They don't over complicate it. I think that that's because they don't make it cerebral. Don't use that. What's that tangled mind called again? It nando nando parrado. There's a word of the day. I'm like, yeah, we have a culture that lives in Peru minds here. Since you've learned all these skills, does go in and being isolated or comparable survival programs. I don't know. Obviously you continue to make these very successful programs at these as important as any other bit of kit or a purse orange personal ability to physically ensure these knowledge of spirit and mind.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       It's the most powerful to be able to. I've got as as I would have. I used to say the mind, but it's not, isn't it? It's it. It's greater than that. It is the ability to control my state. I think. Wow. You know, I've, I've definitely spent days and days and days running around like a headless chicken in survival situations, making a meal of things, but the time when you stop and compose yourself and meditate that that's when it starts going well. So this is one thing thAt people that are not surviving in extreme conditions can learn because we are all surviving on the, on the mountains and terrains and tundras of the inner space of the inner life. And we have to find a way of reflecting somehow finding an inner tree, an inner connection where we can find repos and like, you know, I agree with what you've said about sort of conventional religion that I believe a lot of people get to access, get to contact, get to connection through conventional religion.

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       But I believe that unless we have this point of my struggle in my own life is being able to find a point of access like that and len maintain it because I get distracted away from it if I get frightened or if I get full of desire, like it very hard to keep the connection. So I suppose it's fascinating when someone distills it as you have done into obvious. Certainly not obvious. I'm sort of modern. I wanna say epic survival conditions, you know, if I can survive in this extreme. Why? I mean it's a slightly comical setting really. I mean, I'm not in a survival situation, I'm being dropped off by a tv crew in an area where they know there's gonna be some water and there's going to be, and you're making an entertaining show and the parameters are survival. Yes, I've got a lot of fire without matches or a lighter, yes, I've got to find food, but it is essentially a little snapshot of life. It's just life into glorious technicolor and the fact that you have, you've got to do all of those components, but I'm still stressed about will I get the right footage to make the program run

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       by worrying about whether I'm going to pay next month's mortgage. You know, all the normal stuff was still there. And therefore I think with the added component of, because obviously directing film, everything myself with that component and surviving, it's huge control freak, a massive control freak. I certainly have been, but um, but I think, I think yeah, therefore meditation's really necessary. otherwise I'd just tie myself in knots all the time and it would all become too overwhelming. Would you be able to do the sustained periods of isolation or even separation now that you are a father and husband?

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       I've got a new show started filming in january, so I'm going to have to do mate that's actually got a another show, which I think they're going to commission. I'm not sure. I'm not Allowed to say it involves my family involved In both of them actually, which could be very. That is amazing. I really hope that gets made because one of the things I think my fantasies version of this is it must be so amazing to know that it's society falls apart on sometimes it feels like it might or even the issue that you'd be out guy, right? It's okay, we're going here, we're going to do this, this, this, and that. Must be amazing. Yeah. No, I actually quite, um, I get, I could do gain a little confidence that I have known that confidence of being able to go into the word, take two bits of work together and be able to make a fire.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       That's a cool thIng. I used to say the mickey. So much of sort of geeks who watch star trek and make fire by friction and used to take the, yeah, take the piss out of them. But um, having gone through that and I'm in an mls cynical person now, I think it's a really nice wholesome, organic skill. So yeah, It's almost like it would be a lovely thing. I'd love to know that. I'd love to be to know that this is what you need to survive because I feel like possibly the sense of abandoned and vulnerability that you described in your own personal drama. Most of us know our life is held together by the power of other people were like, you know, we're, we need the house. We need the clothes. We need to say we need the media. We need to advertise and we need the comments.

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       We need the banks. We can't confront the banks. Bring down the bloody government will be dead in 10 minutes because there's no one can see in the american survivalist movement. The sheriff that night. That is a sense of we want to be independent. We want to live tribally wanting to be connected to nature in an hour like that. So that's the impetus, but there's no language to do it and there's no culture to do it. And there's certainly no way of a correlate in a or conflate in the fact that it is a spiritual as well as physical endeavor to be able to survive in the world. Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head and think that's why my shows are successful is because people want to vicariously live in this world where they don't need a bank there. They don't have to go to the supermarket in order to buy the food. They want to be able to do it for themselves. And yet you're right, there are no, you can't, you can't achieve that in this world. You can't go off the grid really. And the uk is it. And I mean, it's incredibly difficult to do so all sorts of alternative cultures, um, think that they can survive without money. And certainly in the uk,

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       you know, they can't

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       do that. We're owned. And in fact, you also feel that if you try to do it, forces would step in and prevent it. Well, the word, I mean travel is obviously a looked down upon and by a huge number of parts of society aren't they? Because you know, they're not contributing to the state, but we've got around culture, we don't want to do this and making their own choices and they don't want to be a part of the mainstream. And I think inherently a lot of people have a bit of that in them anyway. Those of us that don't have this monumental will to survive an ambition that you have expressed and six, uh, and uh, achieved such success for what do, what can we do to access and learn from your trials and your journeys? What would you suggest? Even someone like me, I mean my mate matt, who's such a fan, I'm a great fan of yours.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       You a great hero of his. He's like staying or like we want to do campaign. He's going definitely in some suspended 10 in a private word in essex this weekend, friday, saturday, and sunday. And I'm debating whether or not to go with him. I mentioned it to my wife and she said, yeah, you should go. You should go to bloody out. I think like, uh, but like, uh, you know, like easy that we should say, right. Some of my life has got to be like that cold plunge in the pond moment where you're hit with the reality of what life is. Would you suggest that sort of thing. I think. I think it's a really good idea to sort of structure a bit of that into your life. Whether that's, you know, going, walking in the peak district at the weekend or wherever it is getting out of london.

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       It's really difficult. I think you can do it in london, but it's really difficult to step out of that heady space when you were in london. There's just so much energy with the concentration of people, but it might be a bit like that aboriginal man san shut the fuck up. It might be like that on him. There's times 12 million winning mentally. Imagine all of the, all of the energy. And I hadn't said a word in that car and yet he, he just said, I just cannot think with all that noise going on in your head a bit. Bloody jed. I bet. And it is a bit, but It was quite cool as well. It's welcome. I think you do. Most of us need to get out in order to get that clarity of thought or to just stop thinking. And I think london confuses it or, or very dense populations do confuse it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Yeah. So make space for yourself in some way, whether it's sort of like a walk in to pick some way of interacting with nature in a very, in a very literal way. What about, what do you thInk of this quote? I think about it sometimes chesterton said to the truly adventurous man would it likes an interest? And I'm not saying this as a dick with a, uh, you know, Instead of trekking across planes and climbing mountains would simply jump over these next door neighbors fence, meanIng I suppose that adventure is potentially all around us and what we're bound by in a sense, he's convention and we all live in restricted space that you think that, that, that what you have learned as a literal survivalist has had so many are evident spiritual connotations and it's driven you in the direction of the spirit. That there are ways of crossing boundaries that these techniques could be applied to the way that we. Are you curious about the way this could affect societies, what you've learned?

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       I think for me, yeah, I would agree with that in the fact that I don't, I don't feel that need to go and climb a mountain or, or, um, you know, conquer something that hasn't been achieved before as much anymore. I think everyone needs meaning in their life obviously. and you know, from having a baby recently as well, that suddenly it just changes your perspective on life. You're not the center of the world anymore. Something really meaningful that yes, okay, it's a bit of a cliche and everyone says that your life changes when you have a baby, but for me it has all of the stuff that I still do and I'm not going to stop going on. Adventures feels like it has gotten meaning because you know, again, there's an analogy that our is like or relationship is like ships in the harbor. It's like built in a harbor and it's safe in the harbor, but you don't build a ship to stay in their heart, but it has to go out and it has to go on journeys and it has to come back again and I think it's all part and parcel of the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       yes, it's good to go away and adventures. Yes, it's good to go and have experiences outside of the nucleus of the family, but invariably you're going to come back and it makes going on those journeys or the more meaningful because you've got something wholesome and meaningful to come back to you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       I think before that, that's why it's called relationship. You're meant to go on a voyage. Weren't meant to be a punk, but basically was, wow. So I think I want to, I'm going to go and do this campaign. We can think what I want to do. Some, learn some surviving things off you will perhaps. What should we. Do we do it. Is there some way you can think of format in that alternative into anything like, I mean, not necessarily for television but possibly for television, but like I just like feel like what would you

Speaker 2:          00:58:05       eclipse suggest? It wouldn't be a difficult thing to, to set up a survival scenario where we could go in and teach you if he wants to as well. It will be all over it. Some survival stuff and then uh, and then set he to It. Um, whether that's as a two or individually on your own If you want to do experience the isolation, but as well. But I really do. Yeah, I'd love to do wow

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       asset real good. Clear. And is there anything and just to return again. So it was a simple thing. People listen to this podcast to learn things in a later week here. And you have been absolutely fantastic. I want to do this because then like the whole time I'm doing it, I'm thinking this is all information. This is amazing information. I need this information to other. He's actually actually matt morgan is actually outside standing in the corridor or looking for a nordic. Actually come in, come in, come in. that'd be so silly. It's so under the skin. And listeners, if you listen to the radio show that I also do. You will have heard of matt morgan. We're going to wrap up the show soon. But matt would you.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       He can't even get in the bloody studio. It's elevated stuff. Alright. So matt morgan and ed's come and share my microphone. I don't when you bought the ring because it will. Yeah, that's it. Let's not try and pretend that we're cool in front of it. Now I told you I've already told it that we're planning to do that. Whether you are definitely the campaign. the other thing is you're he. Well one night. Yeah. Well possibly one night. Is there any effort like whipping edge been absolutely amazing. And talking about like last, this was the, would be the podcast I would most recommend that you listen to. I think you'll, I think you'll love it. What, what sort of trials and what sort of techniques and tips would you suggest that people listening to this now should try in our own lives? That without, as I was saying, being a monument and adventure?

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       Well, I mean for me the thing that's helped me and I do use it into over situations and, and outside is what we've already talked about, but that's meditation and you know, the app that I spoke about, the headspace, um, you know, use your cultural collateral 10 minutes 20 pence with promoting genuinely don't start our own ones that every day we're let, okay, let's start with taking that time and get him as a guest to have some perspective over being wrapped up in your own, in your own life and being super involved in your own little stories. It's just stepping one step Back and be able to have a bit of perspective and clarity. And that's helped me at home in relationship since verbal situations that across the board, I just imagine it must be a phenomenal lesson to know that you can survive, that you can survive emotionally, that you can survive spiritually, that you can survive physically and like, and the importance that you've placed on the spiritual component of that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       And I say I wasn't pushing it in that direction as being not much. It doesn't shut up about that. Can we talk about stuff that I know something about so I can complete in this chat and. Yeah. So I think it's fantastic match. You want to ask question and as you're here in 87 bivy bags, right? Yeah. If I'm. Because I'm going tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. is thEre any, do they keep you any warmer in the tent or is it just like there instead of attending in a tent you don't need. You don't even know if it's going to told you that it was a t. Skin tent has got an inner and an outer. Yeah. Okay. But if you want to sleep outside just in the baby bag, then that's an option. I'd go for like, um, polyester woven, got full gortex because you could get a bit sweaty and it's getting very real.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Now, the last word for eight after all that fantastic with said it before, you get a bit sweaty after talking about the true nature of man, access to the infinite that we are trope of war are traveling between jogs.
