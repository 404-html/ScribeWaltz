Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Sam harris. He's a writer, neuroscientist, philosopher and host of the podcast, waking up with Sam Harris. He's written five New York Times bestsellers covering a range of topics from neuroscience and religion to violence and human reasoning. These include the end of faith letter to a Christian nation, free will and the moral landscape. He's the Co founder and Chief Executive of Project Reason and nonprofit organization that promotes science and secularism and as argued that science can determine moral values. He's previously studied both eastern and Western religious traditions including Buddhism, Hinduism, making several trips to India and Nepal. He is now a proponent of secular meditation practices. He's a vegetarian practices Brazilian Jujitsu and is married with two daughters and has a correction.

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       I'm going to have to recant on the vegetarian there a can in the vegetarianism for the moment. I unfortunately, it's exactly like a pasta. Well, welcome. Thank you. Regardless of the embracing the Avatar that I'm trailing vine. Yeah. Yeah. Um, thanks for coming on. I've talked to you for such a long time. Oh yeah. And I've heard from so many of our mutual audience members that we should be getting together. So, because I suppose in the works for a long time, yeah, yeah. We exist in that sort of a, in the sonic boom created by Joe Rogan perhaps. Yeah. Maybe. How'd you want Joe Rogan? I listened to waking up and I've heard a bunch of your stuff. I saw you on Joe Rogan as well. So yeah, Joe Joe is the, the 800 pound gorilla of podcasters. Casey is, everyone knows. Yeah, he's the

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       very much that we are all orbiting Joe Rogan let's face yet. And like, God, there's so much stuff I want to ask you about, but you know, because there's loads of things we agree on loads, but there are some pretty distinct things that I imagine we disagree on. And I suppose these will be some of the, some interesting things to, to, um, to analyze. Um, but just to start us off, um, I suppose, tell us a little bit about that. The, the fusion of neuroscience, philosophy and atheism and the, the, the, it's become sort of the, the defining of people's perception of you, but there's a sort of a, I suppose a neurological, a underwriting for your sort of personal perspective of atheism and how you fit in, what you've learned in this sort of like the 10 years since you've come to prominence and how your positions perhaps evolved.

Speaker 3:          00:02:25       Yeah. Well, the, the atheism connection is probably just an accident of history more than anything because it really is what happened to my intellectual life right after September 11th. So I was doing my neuroscience phd, I had a background in philosophy. I was, I went into neuroscience very much with the interest of a philosopher. I was, I was always interested in understanding the human mind at a, uh, a high, a high, a level that really about, would only be doing work in, in people. And I'm not, I wasn't ever thinking of curing diseases. And it was all about just understanding human subjectivity and consciousness and morality and, uh, human reason. The, these were the kinds of, uh, higher level mental attributes that interested in me. And so I was doing my, I was in the middle of my phd. I had done my coursework, I was getting into neuro imaging work on belief.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       I was studying the difference between belief and disbelief and uncertainty. And then September 11th happened and I had, I had a background in meditation. I had a background in explicitly, uh, trying to cash out rather ancient spiritual concerns, um, uh, through whatever methodology was available. So I had, you know, had taken psychedelics in my twenties. I had spent about two years on silent retreat. I was, you know, very connected to the experiential side of what people think they're only religion is good at. Right. But I was not a believer, uh, uh, of, of any sort. I was, um, I was, I was an atheist, but I never thought of myself as an atheist. I was totally unaware of atheism as an organized political movement. I couldn't have told you who Madelyn, Mario hair was. I mean, there's a famous atheist. I, you know, I was aware of people like Richard Dawkins for their science, but I was not someone who had read books on atheism.

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       And so my first book, the end of faith, which, which really was the really initiated this, this publishing phenomenon that was called the new atheism. I, because then it was, it was me and then Dawkins, and then I came out with my second book and then Dan Dennett and Christopher Hitchens, all of us had these books that came out. Um, I never even used the word atheism in the end of faith. And it was, it wasn't that I thought not to use it, it just was not a word I used. So I was just talking about the, the conflict between reason and faith, the con conflict between science and religion, the, the obvious untenable realty. I mean that the actual proper horror of the fact that we have a world that has shattered into these separate religious communities and these separate and incommensurable worldviews based on an adherence to these ancient books.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       Uh, and that strikes me as, and then as it struck me then, and it strikes me now as just as perverse as people blowing themselves up over rival interpretations of Shakespeare. And I mean, just imagine there was some hamlet cult versus some king lear cult, right? And people are willing to die for these differences. Those cults exists. But that, that's the world we're living in. I mean, our world is just that absurd. And so I reacted to all of this in the aftermath of September 11th, uh, without ever defining myself in my own mind as someone who was now shilling for atheism. But then I got inducted into this, into the conversation about atheism. So it, it's, it's somewhat ironic that atheist is one of the first words that in my bio, but it's not, it's not an

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       no. Was retrospectively applied or though your [inaudible] you say you were kind of the insight in incident of your public life. Your life is a public in a lecturer was nine 11, which you, uh, rigidly defined as a, I said, I've suppose judging from what you've just said as a, a religious event primarily or an act of religious violence.

Speaker 3:          00:06:23       Oh yeah. Well it was, it was clearly that you might want to talk about other variables that could explain it or that could of could of, uh, uh, other motives that, that people might have. You know, you might want to talk about politics or economics or, or, um, US foreign policy with a legacy of colonialism. But I think it is absolutely clear that while those variables account for some of them, the misbehavior in our world, there are still people who get up in the morning with 100% of their motivation being a religious expectation of an afterlife. I mean, these people exist. I can just find you these people who have none of the other variables that people would want to use to explain. And the terrestrial variables, economics, politics, there are people who have never suffered any economic insecurity who devote their life to Jihad. There are people who drop out of the London School of economics who are British citizens so that they can go fight with Isis. So, and it's,

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       what does that to you imply the toxicity of religious ideology?

Speaker 3:          00:07:37       Well, it's, it's the power of belief. It's not even, it's not even, it's not even purely toxic. I mean, this is the, the horrible paradox here. I think the experience of people even in the, even in the most extreme, and we might want to say psychopathic cults, right? Something like Isis. The experience by and large is not of being a psychopath. It's a, it's not like Isis. And again, now we're sort of now focusing on, obviously my criticism of religion is much wider than focusing on fundamentalist Islam. But to take this case, many people think that Isis was acting like a bug light for the world. Psychopaths that only psychopaths would go over there and behave this badly and then you, what you're talking about is bad people who would behave badly anyway. These are people who were going to rape and kill any way and they just found an excuse or a, or a pretext by which to do it under the ages of religion.

Speaker 3:          00:08:38       That's just not true. I mean, we just know enough about the bios of these people that it's, and you would never say that of someone who was observing some other religious behavior slavishly under, under some doctrines. He wouldn't say that, you know, that you wouldn't explain the behavior of people at the mass, the Catholic mass, you know, where they line up to eat a cracker. You wouldn't say, well this is just, you know, politically motivated, crack reading behavior of these people would find pretext, eat crackers on Sundays anyway. You know, they would, they would, they would ritualize their cracker eating behavior for some other reason. No, no. They have a belief that explains exactly what they're doing with this cracker. And they'll tell you, and, and, and it's, it's just not, and it's, it's, it's a doctrine that they're following. And if a doctor, if the doctor and said, eat two crackers, they'd be in two crackers.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Sure. But like I personally, and presumably you would agree with this, the Catholic mass is serving a particular function as all ritual and ceremonies and the literalness if the cracker is secondary to it's evident, perfunctory role, uh, as I, uh, a place for social cohesion, acknowledgement of mortality and the potential for the human soul or the human essence to aspire to something beyond the carnal blood and body drives. If we take Christ from a more theological as opposed to sort of a, in a sort of reductive simplistic. And I think for me personally, spiritually useless perspective as, as like the metaphor of Christ being that the potential for transcendence beyond the flesh individual to the enlightened male that Oh, the enlightened being I suppose, uh, then the sort of the mass for me is an opportunity to ceremoniously acknowledged that meaning. So like I, I would look at a mass and go, oh, this ain't about literally in crackers and like, and in even the metaphor as explicitly stated in the scriptural terms of that denomination, there's more that even that is limited. I would say that people drive to do that as, as, as Mariam is Mariam.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       So you're, you're, you're flipping the logic of what I'm saying. So I'm saying that the thing that explains the actual ritual, the cracker eating is the doctrine, right? If the doctrine, we're different, if the doctrine where if Jesus had said, well, this bread is, it has nothing to do with my body. So it doesn't matter what you do at the mass, right? Don't eat anything right to eat anything is to pollute your body. You should just be thinking about me, right? If that was the doctrine, there would be no cracker eating ritual, right? So that, so the doctrine is, it says, I mean, it's a bizarre act of, of, you know, human sacrifice and cannibalism at the, at the bottom of it, which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       But if you look at the roots of agricultural diety worship and the relationship between the known and the unknown and the necessity to have relationship with plants or season, it doesn't, it doesn't

Speaker 3:          00:11:40       gonna be eating his body like, like, like they wouldn't the, the people

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       except as a metaphor for union. Yeah. But in oneness.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       Yeah. Except it's not taught. It's not preached as a metaphor and the doctrine's not metaphorical. I will grant you that many, many people aren't thinking about it literally now. But that's just to say they've lost their faith in the actual doctrine of the,

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       and I think that's important. And also I think we have to look beyond rationalism. I think when we're dealing, you know, you are a man who is deeply interested in mysticism and spirituality in anything. Once it's on the plane of the corporal and the rational, then it to evaluate the symbols purely, rationally, they're always going to be sort of kind of left wanting because yeah, the in a wafer or drinking some wine. But if you have a relationship with the wholeness,

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       I would be slow to conclude that I think, I don't think you have to be irrational to use these tools

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       or beyond rational, not the rational, not like a necessarily less than rational, possibly more than that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       Clearly more than form any rational understanding of the universe. There's more to life than that. I mean there's, there's, there's fun, there's love, there's beauty, there's, there's uh, there's more that we want out from life than simply not being wrong. Right? So I'm not saying that that reason is everything, but the question is, do you ever have to be irrational to go beyond merely conceptually understanding the world? Do you ever have to lie to yourself? Do you ever ever have to have to lie to others or believe the lies of others to go beat, go into these other areas that, that no one would know. But most people are living as though absolutely you do that because religion is just the most profligate example of lying that, that any and self deception.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       We mentioned it. Politics is it, I mean it's

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       every bit as bad except then it just, it pauses an afterlife where it gets all cashed out

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       except of course, you know, like again to return to the point about nine 11 new or particularly induction. Sure. Wittingly or otherwise I into what's being come known as the new atheistic movement. That for me, what, this is a question I suppose if that particular event taken in isolation, is it like, you know, Bob Barry can horrific and dreadfully cinematic and totemic. Uh, but definitely taking place within a historical context. For me, they're very variables that you, fleetingly mentioned economics, colonialism, these like how do we delineate, how do we sort of, where are these imaginary lines drawn between this is religious violence, this is political violence. This is acceptable violence to who draws those lines. Also,

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       they can be very easily drawn when you, when you take the case of any individual and his or her motives

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       individuals, yeah, we have to resort to individualism as opposed to cultural, national movements. You have to take that individual is crazy. But that state and that state action,

Speaker 3:          00:14:48       I would first say that very few of these people are crazy. So let me just break this down a little bit because there are many different types of violence and so there, there are, there are crazy people who are just crazy in, in the, in the, uh, the more clinical sense of that term, which is, which is to say they're suffering some thought disorder. They're, they're, they're, they're, they're suffering from some kind of delusion, right? So, you know, many of the people that are schizophrenia, but, but you know, there are probably other ways we want to, um, class a thought disorder here, but they're not, they're not rational. They don't have rational goals. They're hearing voices. They think they're talking to the, you know, the, the son of Sam thought his dog was telling him to kill people.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       Next door's dog at all. Right. Okay. Yeah, we're still, yes, exactly. Pay attention to your own dark, rough night. Um, so yes, and different from everyone else.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       People who are mentally ill are not dangerous. But there are some people who are mentally ill who are right now, there are people who do horrific things for no ideological motive, no rational animus, but purely because they're crazy, right? So you take like every one example would be probably this Guy Adam Lanza who went into the school in Newtown and killed 20 some odd children and, and half a dozen teachers, right? I think 26 people were gunned down. He, I don't know what, I don't know if anyone gave a diagnosis. I mean he was probably almost certainly on the autistic spectrum, but he had something else going on, but he didn't, he wasn't a white supremacist who had some ideology who was, who was acting out in this way. He wasn't a jihadist who thought he was going to get into paradise. Right? So, uh, and there are many other examples of mass shootings like that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       Jared lauffner was a guy like that. You know who, um, uh, whereas you, if you're going to talk to this person and find out why he did it, nothing is going to make sense right now. That is very different. And yet, so that we could talk about the same superficial crime of going in and killing children in a school, right? Uh, there's that version of it. Then there's the, uh, really angry, uh, and I would argue, psychopathic, sadistic, eat classically evil person who just wants to kill kids, right? Who just gets off on all of the misery he's going to create as a result of this crime. Now this person is not suffering a thought disorder. Now we, if we knew more about the brain, I think in the end we would, we would be happy to say, well, there's still something wrong with this guy's brain. I mean, we're human evil is a species of neurological disorder, but we don't understand it yet. And so now where it's tempting just to say, well, these people are evil, right? It's a very different kind of person from the first person. Um, and yeah, there's probably into the boundary between those people are or can be kind of fluid, but, but you know, these are different types of people.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       No, but

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       get to the worst case. The worst case is there are, who are as good, whoever are moral and as ethical and as committed to the wellbeing of themselves and others as you and I are, who still go in and shoot up schools and kill everybody and hope to die in the process because they think they can get into paradise that way and get into p. So when, when members of the Taliban went into a school in Pakistan and killed, I think it was 137 kids and, and, and burn their teacher alive in front of them. Uh, you have to ask yourself, what do you think? You know, all members of the Taliban who endorsed, who did this and then all of those and the Taliban who endorsed this, we're all just psychopaths or mentally ill. No, no. If you listen to what they're saying, if you listen to what their, where they believe, if you read the texts that they think are the verbatim word of the creator of the universe, it all falls into place. This is perfectly rational behavior given the requisite beliefs. And that is what is so horrible about this kind of dogmatism.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       Even that process or that sort of extreme example of the execution of children in schools. You base of an elective reading of even that particular doctorate and it'd be particular like passages you go, oh is the passage where the sort of not so much. Unfortunately there's loads of stuff that's like live a peaceful life of devotion. [inaudible] have you read the Quran? Have you read the Quran cover to cover saw bloody, we're laughing. There's mainly got through these notes for this interview, so I'm doing this thing on the flight. You can, you can do it at the point it's a short book or like my general feeling is that the Quran holy is like most religious scripture. The intention is to create a social environment where people are benevolent and cohesive, which ultimately became a tool for social control as a result of the way the power structures, but there's more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       There's, there's likely the religion in politics, but I don't know. I think, again, I wouldn't deliberately misread the metaphor for, for me, life after death, and this is a person who spent two years in a silent matree, Gavi, you with Dick. This is that beyond the life that is determined by primal desires and biographical wants and your imagination of yourself. There is a life after the death of that individual. After that individual dies and you recognize that the temporal can never provide fulfillment, you gain access to a sort of a second life and after life, the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the earth and man sees it, not the Kingdom of Heaven, the life after the death of your ego. So Sam, yes, I would say I would like if it's not talking about that, I don't know what it's talking about and what the value of that would be as a, as a, as a manual for being, for being human. There's so much, mate, let me, hold on a sec. We've got go for you did a big classification system of the degrees of who we've got to do the schools. Okay. What we'll do. Then do your flag and then we're going back to the school.

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       You want to acknowledge that. However, whatever

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       personal reading breathing

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       is, most people most of the time think that the afterlife is a literal place. You go after die. That consciousness survives the death of the body. And in the Judeo Christian tradition, especially the Christian, the Christian and the and the, the Islamic tradition, it really matters whether you believe the right thing or not. I mean, in fact this life doesn't matter at all and that's what's so corrosive about this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       But like in it, and actually look at some of the alternatives now we did, we just, their device to barometer of degrees if madness and the worst types of madness and the worst way to tobacco your kids murdered in a school by which particular type of madman, you know, but we should probably bring into the mix. Not all men are like, I don't mind kids killed in a school by for any ideology, whether it's grounded in sort of rationalism and economics or whether it's a book that's a bit older and more, I don't know, esoterical colorful or imaginative, I don't know sort of how to determine it. But what I suppose what I suppose the heart of why I want to get to is whilst undoubtably religion has been used to justify violence from all types of Ang, uh, angles and in different historical moments and you know, Buddhist violence in Burma and Christian violence in, you know, like in the Middle East or sit or secular violence underwritten by Christianity, resourced entirely from Christiana in sort of Christian dualistic notions undertaken by far right Christian president and whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       Or you know, sort of the more lucid livid and office and contemporaneous a far right is a extremist Islamic violence. It's like, well, how do we see that as distinct from rational violence, political violence, particularly when that is far more potent palm, far more widespread. And it's, I would say is the violence of the dominant culture. What interests me, Sam Harris is power and the powerful, and for me I'm interested in who gets to decide who the other is, who gets to decide by what metric. Rationalism and religion is evaluated. And it seems to me that the kind of violence that's focused on in a lot of your work is the violence of desperate people. Desperate possibly subjugated people. And I would say to this, I know that you don't do this, but I want you to educate me on this. But to dismiss the colonial aspect, the, the sort of economic aspect, the occupation of Middle Eastern countries and historical, I mean if for me it seems like how, how can you conduct that extraction? How can you divorce those different types of violence? They seem to me to be part of one narrative.

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       Well, I can do it very simply because you have exam just to dissect out the variable of colonialism or oppression from the outside. Um, you have examples of people who have been oppressed as, as oppressed as any other people who don't resort to this kind of violence because they don't have the same belief structure. Right? So take that. Here's a, here's a, an almost perfect scientific experiment. You, Palestinian Christians and Palestinian Muslims living in the same occupied territories right now, who was blowing that well before the Israelis put up the wall who was blowing themselves up in, in pizza parlors and discotheques, right? It was 99.9% Muslim, right? It was not Christian. You have Coptic Christians in Egypt being murdered by their Muslim neighbors, by suicide bombings who don't resort to their own suicide bombings in return. Right? It's the beliefs matter.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       The details matter. Why do you fetishize the or antagonism towards that particular type of violence? Not, it's not a, it's not a fetish. It's just violence exists in the context of a far more potent opponents. Violence. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Like he can't, we can't talk about Palestinian violence. And for Christian person you might acknowledge saying no, not talking about history. No, of course, of course we can because we can because you can have sweet though.

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       Moral morning, someone in Orange County will be converted to this belief system and want to fight in the name of this cause. And it's purely a matter of belief. It's, it's as much a matter of belief as you wanting to go on a diet or a learning to meditate. Or maybe I'll go to Hawaii this year for

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       my vacation. These are ideas. But luckily, you know, you and I, we live in a sort of a secular society and our beliefs seldom come into opposition with the dominant philosophy. And when it does there, there are problems.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       W what worries me? So I was really, oh, so that might be here. My background concerns, I think ideas are the most powerful things we've got right? Ideas are the operating system for human life and human culture. And if we fail to build a civilization that works, it will be because of the failure of ideas or our failure to communicate good ideas to one another in such a way that's persuasive. So, so, I mean, how do you get 7 billion strangers to peacefully collaborate with one another? It is a matter of conversation that ultimately gets people to converge on common projects and common values. And so all we have is conversation. And when conversation fails, all we have is violence, right? There's, there's really just two modes, conversation in violence and what you're talking about when you're talking about power and it's misuses, you're talking about state violence or, or state coercion, uh, that you deem to be illegitimate.

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       Now I'll grant you. But if we, if we took a list of all of these cases, you know, CIA run coups and other countries where, you know, you and I may just check the same box. It's like, well that looks legitimate or that, that had consequences that could have easily been foreseen. Lots of people suffered and died there that shouldn't have the objectives. All of it. Yes. And, and, um, so, but when I'm looking at cases of, of uh, when I prompt prioritize kind of the light of shining the light of my criticism on specific ideas and specific human behavior, I'm looking by and large for the, the, the craziest and most dangerous ideas that should be, I mean it's, this is really the low hanging fruit for kind of bad epistemology. The thing, the human behavior that should seem impossible, right? Like, and suicide bombing was not a drone bombing.

Speaker 3:          00:27:13       It's not just the aesthetics. It's not just aesthetics because because suicidal people are undetectable, so jihadists are undetectable. If part of it's the best thing that can happen in an operation is that you die while conducting it. You are the perfect weapon. That's fair. So, but I just have to hammer, I have to hammer this home. When you're talking about the possibility of something like nuclear terrorism or biological terrorism that, you know, when someone tries to weaponize smallpox, killed 100 million patients, nuclear terrorism, he's not hypothetical already happened 50 years ago. No, I won't call it, I won't call that nuclear terrorism. There was certainly a first piece of dice semantics would be your primary concern. Nobody call that thing. But how my teeth, it's reasonable to ask, well how the Japanese view it now and how the Japanese view their relationship with the United States. Now it's, it's a, there's, there's an argument.

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       I'm not, I'm not defending narrative Sam that supersede the uh, power and narrative of nationalism and geopolitics gift where there is that, but they make sense, determine it. They make the, the, the Japan and the US no longer see themselves in a position or positions. Right? Well, so what, so one question is how, how are we going to get all of these societies that are at loggerheads to see themselves in Nonzero sum, uh, arrangements with everyone else and um, and what's, what we'll have to change to make that possible. And my concern with religion, religious fundamentalism and not all religions equally. Um, but uh, my concern is that these are the beliefs that are held most closely. They're the least negotiable. I mean, they're by definition non negotiable. These are the, these are my faith based beliefs are the beliefs that that if you challenge them that will buy whatever evidence or whatever argument, I will take that as a personal insult and I will want, want to resort immediately to violence or the threat of violence. I will want blasphemy laws. I would want to pass a law at the UN that will, that will give you jail time. If you say the wrong thing about my holy book, right? That's where conversation has totally broken down and there's nothing to, to resort to. But for us, when you say a suicide bomber, I bet it's an extraordinary, and it's difficult for us to understand. But what I'm curious

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       about, Sam is the, what are the prerequisite conditions for suicide bombing even to be relevant. And I also can't help but thinking when I sort of feel when, when we sort of recall events like waco or any disruption or anything that sort of ruptures the sort of like the, the uh, American mainframe are not American. So here, this goes beyond nation. If you put, if you find yourself in opposition to the state, the means by which the state will deploy violence doesn't need to resort to sort of Lurid, livid, blatant clumsy acts like suicide bombing. Because the power is so evident, the ability to exert power and control is so total that it doesn't need sort of like almost the sort of graphic and horrific whimsy of something like a suicide bombing all be underwritten by something that looks peculiar to people like us that value life and value fine, don't have a belief system that's like, oh, I'll be in some sort of a Valhalla subsequently.

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       Well you were using Waco is an example of state oppression or suicidal sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       I'm using it as an example of the [inaudible]. The, the, the, the kind of violence that interest me is the violence of the truly powerful and the kindness. So for me, I said like suicide, but I can see that it's kind of, it's gratuitous and sort of, and therefore an appealing form. But for me when, when analyzing nine 11 to focus on the perpetration of that event and the motivation of the individuals involved as opposed to the geopolitical circumstances. Um, and what happens generally when two narratives come into conflict with one another, short changes us and means that we focus like I'm my sole interest. Sam is who he like when you talk about how are we going to get these 7 billion people to cooperate and form communities based on mutual values, which for some reason I believe is a possibility, my own spirit, my own spiritual pursuits if led me to the point where I have a basic optimistic view of humanity, my own personal experience with Muslims is led me to believe that Islam is eight essentially a positive thing,

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       a positive thing. But that's a bad way to take his temperature. You're at me cause how many Muslims have you had a personal experience with our, granted you, you're taking the temperature on the bicep bloody suicide bombers and no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm, I'm taking the temperature on the basis of the actual doctrine that makes sense of this behavior. And also aspects of the doctrine that aspects of the, no, no it's, but wait, wait, hold on. Let me just, I got to,

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       I could imagine that we'd have this conversation then there'd be a bit we went, yeah, he sounds not that bad.

Speaker 3:          00:32:18       I think come into this room. We're thinking that, but it's, it's worth connecting with you have these dots because it's not just a matter of the killing of people. I'm talking about how people want to live. So if you ask yourself, and this is just a thought experiment, um, if you ask yourself if you gave perfect power to any one group, right. And they, so they could impose their way of life, every other group. So he gave him, this is my magic wand argument that I use in my first book. Um, you know, Give Dick Cheney a magic wand and Dick Cheney, the prototypical evil mustache twirling bastard, who, who gave us the Iraq war and, and is as demonized on the left as, as anyone. What would he have done if he had the power, you know, just to make a life in the Middle East and Afghanistan

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       any way he wanted. It doesn't need to. We did not need to conjecture. They said we want to ever remove the ability of our opponents to respond. It's in the public sphere. Let's go a little further.

Speaker 3:          00:33:16       Let's, no, let's go a little further in our imagination. Do you actually think, uh, and maybe Dick Cheney has been so demonized that he's the wrong case here, but I have a strong opinion. But Dick Cheney. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, how you spell that is, this is what I would guess, right? Someone like Dick Cheney, if given unlimited Ken unload just magic the resources of magic magic, you're doing like a two to narrow reading of that, right? Yes. We don't want to be a bit that, we don't want these people to be able to attack us. Right? That's the goal of the war. I'm saying,

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       oh, oppose our objectives, but what are, so let's go. So what would we want that region for a kickoff? We won't tell on challenged.

Speaker 3:          00:34:01       No, no, but I'm talking about, I'm talking about magic. We don't even need to steal their resources. We have the power of magic. Now what will life would you impose on these people? Right? What? What life would would the worst of us in power, like Dick Cheney impose on these people? I think he'd make Afghanistan or Iraq, like Nebraska, right? This would not, he would not be some hell scape of unnecessary suffering. It would be a starbucks on every corner. Mere capitalism. Now you have your critique of this way of life. No doubt. But he would w what? What he would want to impose on these people is orderly economic, probably good Christian behavior. Right? He would want movie theaters. It all be watching the Oscars right now what? What would Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi impose on everyone else? He's told us explicitly because he tried the experiment in Syria and Iraq. We know exactly how he wants to live and he wants others to live. It is seventh century theocratic barbarism and there's no doubt about that. It is fornicators homosexuals thrown from rooftops and fornicators. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:07       Whether it's their throats slit. Shortly we can agree on is that what the, the second guy name, I don't know. Is it relevant and broadly speaking, irrelevant in terms of view of 7 billion individuals. Dick Cheney's, starbucks on every corner

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       there are 1.7 billion Muslims, majority of which live under some significant theocratic constraint. You're talking

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       about women, it's not the same theocracy. Listen, I'm just as concerned about Christian theocracy as you are. How can you, cause I think like you're about to talk about sort of gender issues, but you're, once again it's free thought issues. It's shines. Surely but, but, but the metric by which we evaluate them is a distinct metric could drawn from another narrative and the free and alfred like so like you know, we might say, oh bloody hell women dressing live out or whatever, you know, we call it, I don't think we're in a position to make those kinds of decisions. Of course we are. Of course we are. You don't think you're in a position think the, their narrative should adhere to our template. Well, first of all, so, so you're a man, you imagine that most women forced to wear a burqa. I don't know about forced.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       And my experience in conversation is being that it's more that we ought to regard it. I think we have, I've asked Muslim women about it and they said to me, it's like, it's like a discipline and when we dig it, but first of all, we're, now I'm talking about a burka. I'm not talking about someone going to Barnard who elects to wear a headscarf because she likes the way, I don't like the imposition of a, like a, of our heterogeneous haitch demonic ideas of how masculine, feminine relationships work might not be universally applicable. Something is universally applicable. And if it's not universal,

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       we can understand those differences. So if there's a culture where they like spicy food and we don't, uh, but eating spicy food is just another way to be happy as a, as a, as an ape, uh, we can understand those differences biologically and culturally. This, the idea that it just may be as good as solution for the, the how to maximize human wellbeing, uh, to put half the population in bags from the moment that and, and not, and not let them learn to read. I mean, I'm taking Afghanistan, I'm taking the local case of Afghanistan under the Taliban, uh, and uh, you know, and it may well fall back. I mean it's, it's actually a Afghanistan currently as well. You're talking about women who

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       are, who have almost the worst possible life on planet earth. I mean, we're talking about maternal mortality rates that are off the charts. You're talking about, uh, illiteracy. That is that you have to go back 200 years in the west to find that level of illiteracy reasoning that's used to justify the bombing. I know it's not an actual colonization. If those territories, they're not like us, they treat women different from us. I don't think position to make those judgements. So then tell me how you would react to this. I have two. I have two daughters. And if I were thinking the way you were thinking about this issue, what if I thought it would be a great idea to have a cultural exchange program where I just sent my daughter's over to Afghanistan to live with a Taliban family. So rather than go to summer school here and get prepared to go to an Ivy League college or whatever it is, I send them to learn. I send them to live with the Taliban. Explained all this to be, I said, well, nobody but nobody. You got to answer it fully experiments. Well, I'm from a Western culled up in indoctrinated

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       dispute. No right or wrong. I don't think that there's the eye. I'm not in a position. I think he's very different. Me Saying, I've been born in the west, I've grown up in the west. My daughter's born in the West now impose upon her a tilt, totally different set of values. I want to go to the deep south over who wanted to go to places in Britain. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:38:54       You don't think it's unlucky to be born a girl in Afghanistan five years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       I think that these kind of a sort of theoretical tableaus are used to create a force hierarchy and a moral superiority by a dominant culture that subsequently uses thinking of this of this nature to underwrite the modern day colonization and subjugation of these people on a massive scale as barbaric and a disgusting is nine 11 was a daily nine 11 since then so that that's a state system can perpetuate yourself using rationalism using comfortable means of executions that glides slyly by all why in the sky is no better than the nine 11 news over patterns too.

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       It is. It is better to let, we can talk. So you're invoking a many things here which we should treat systematically. Things like collateral damage. So you

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       you drop a bomb like that language. It's a euphemism.

Speaker 3:          00:39:56       It's a euphemism but that's, that's the word we use to talk about unintended people getting killed by [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       What was it like when a 7% of drone structures eight a result in a that day? The data here are hard to get our hands around as well. Highly politicized. Yes, of course it is the then the language is important. And who decides what language is used and who decides where powerful and who decides what's rational violence and who decides what religion is even, right.

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       Okay. But so let's, let's treat these things point by point. So

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       first, now let's take them in a giddy. Blah. I'm trying to get out of the Blue

Speaker 3:          00:40:30       Giddy blur is now in my mind. Um, so there's a, there's a fundamental claim that you have just made it at least implicitly that I disagree with. And then I wrote my third book to rebut that. The, the, my third book, the moral landscape is an argument that we can talk about questions of right and wrong and good and evil in universal terms. That these are not merely cultural or personal affectations right? It's not that we're not free.

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       You make it one of your full experience minced in a minute. No, no, no. Because see you on the edge of the, we'll just have sex with her baby. The were say it's wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:41:04       The reason why thought experiments are so useful is that there the, the, the pure case, right? They're not, they will, you can just, you can take one variable at a time. Um, so, um, but this idea that it's all a matter of personal taste or all a matter of culture, right? It suggests that all all cultures, therefore our, I mean, the, the moment you make the link between question of good and evil and the well being of conscious, like questions of happiness and suffering, right? And I think that link is very direct. I mean, that's a separate conversation we can have, but, but I think the only intelligible morality has to focus on human suffering, human wellbeing, and even more broadly to the suffering of any conscious system. So it's animals. If we're, if we're torturing pigs so as to get bacon, uh, that is that we have an ethical obligation to not do that, do that last, find a better way of doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:01       So that is no longer torture breed pigs that don't suffer, whatever it is. But what suffering should be our concern. And if, and so if the moment you grant that you have to grant that not every culture and not every society and certainly not every family, right, has perfectly solved the human wellbeing problem, right? They haven't solved at equally. So if you find a family over here that's forcing their children to live in a basement for 20 years and, and um, to, to interbreed and not, not showing them the light of day, okay, this is, this is a problem that society has an interest in. Now we're now we're now we're talking about power dynamics where the society has an interest in rescue in those children from their deranged and evil parents. Right within this, just this, this could be true just in a single city like Los Angeles, right? As has happened very recently. Um, the, that scales that scales to whole nations and, and to, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       right, global situation. Politically it does. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:03       Politically complex. But for you to withhold judgment of the burqa makes absolutely no sense for you to withhold judgment of

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       no female genital mutilation. Makes absolutely no sense. It's a different way, again, now, now, now.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       Perfect case of getting misled by words because they're, they're highly non analogous. Those two procedures. I'm not, I'm not in favor of male circumcision either, but I'm just saying just talk it to use the word mutilation or circumcision

Speaker 2:          00:43:29       synonymously. Word mutilation. No, you just jumped to the men though. Yes, I listen when we sort of interchange styles of dress, we're still in the caddy blur by the way. I never leave it and personal submission when we interchange that with sort of like sort of a subjugation of a family and keep people in the cellar. But you know, there's different levels of complexity. Now I'd like to, if, if I may shift gears a little sad because one of my great interest in you is your immense intellectual capacity and jaw, uh, what I want to call it without being deliberately provocative zeal and love of ethics and morality. And I would like to know how that relates to your personal spiritual life. I know you are a great meditator. You said like, you know, I've never had there Jesus, two years silence. I think I'd struggled for 25.

Speaker 2:          00:44:14       Well, I mean, I meditate twice a day for 20 minutes and I don't find this right, right. Yeah. No, I mean for me this stuff is the answer now. What the reason I meditate, the reason that I embrace the spiritual life is because I believe I've experienced, I've experienced that for me personally to become a valuable of society. Wherever that song on the microlevel of my family and hopefully on a broader level, I have to take personal responsibility for the fact that I'm a complex individual that are within me. All of the things I would condemn over the course of a podcast talking to a brilliant man like yourself. Maybe one minute I'll condemn violence another minute I'll come down condemn egotism and self centeredness. The I am victim to all of these. I'm perpetrator of self centeredness and egocentrism and the tool that has helped me most to overcome these personal problems.

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       There's been a kind of a spiritual veltin Shang and I planned to use that word with you today. My German's bad. That's, that's literally the only German word you'll hear cause it's the only one I know. So like, let's say my spirituality has been my personal vehicle for carrying me away from sort of selfishness, self destruction, and like I'm talking as a peasant's overcome, not, oh, you know, through the help of others. And to a degree, faith, I must say to a huge degree faith, uh, my own addiction. Now you've got a addiction issues, haven't you? Habitation you just for you dabbling in it. Was your brother know like Dan? No, neither. If you've got no addiction background. No, no. Dan Harris had Dan Harris, who's, who's also, he's a friend. He's not, there's no relation, but he wrote the book 10% happier and it was a big bestseller about mindfulness.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       And so he's had issues that he's talked about. I see. Well, so forgive me. So my person, like, so my personal experiences have been that sort of spirituality and a faith that is determined resolutely by as best as possible, nonjudgmental realism, a benevolence, kindness, being of service to others, principles that broadly speaking don't require me to enter into conflict, but to be off service. Uh, the, this for me, I think is an incredibly valuable resource. And, and, and these things and ethics in general are drawn. I'll not ultimately, because prior, who knows what proceeded religion, some form of theater and ritual. Who knows what they're doing down deep in the dank of the forests, what gods they device there were conscious, well, precisely where consciousness is a little more open. I suppose what I, I want to understand it. So it has, how does your personal spirituality serve you ethically and, and uh, where does that intersect with beyond tolerance?

Speaker 2:          00:46:53       Because tolerance suggests that there's something to tolerate. Where does it lead you to a compassion and love? And what solutions do you think can be derived from your personal understood your present experiences of mysticism and spirituality? Where I would say first that it, it really, while it may seem different from what we've been just talking about, it's of a piece with what we've just been talking about. And the reason why I have such passion for criticizing this particular species of bad ideas, the religious ones is because I see the baby and the bath water that everyone is afraid of losing. And I see that it doesn't require any bullshit

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       too to be saved, right? You don't have to lie to yourself. You don't have to believe that a book was written by the creator of the universe. You don't have to believe that that hell fire weights people who don't call historical person by the right name. You don't have to believe any of those things. And all of those things are absolutely integral to the doctrines of these religions. Uh, and there's many separate religions on off

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       for that are incompatible. I think there's a point where religion and politics intersect and it's not always clear where that line is drawn. And I would say that the point where spirituality stops being about kindness, love, fun. Remember earlier in this podcast you did the list if the things that difficult to quantify scientifically. And I would wonder how, uh, how, how a valuable and a useful those image scans and neuro image scans are when dealing with fun and love. I'm sure they have great service, I'm sure, but like these things, the way that we access them, the way that we increase them. And, and to your earlier point, the way that we as best as possible eliminate suffering. For me, this is the function and the role of spirituality. And, and I think sort of some of the furniture and ornamentation that religions are variously acquired due to the cultural influx infections of the times in which they were conceived for me are less important and less relevant. Whilst I acknowledge that I'm a relatively unique case and some of the extreme, uh, issues that you're addressing, I, I'm, you know, I've been not imaginary. I know that what you're saying is true and there's baby bath water issue. I'm interested in the baby always on about a bath.

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       Well, so what you just described about your own spiritual life and ethical life, um, it is obvious to me that there are universal principles there that what you just described about the consequences of paying attention to certain things. So, so meditation, uh, uh, getting off certain substances that are not good for you. So, you know, breaking with, with addiction, these are universal features of what it's like to have a human mind that is, is based on human neurochemistry. Uh, and, um, this is not something we just made up. It's not something that's, that's a purely a product of our time. It's not merely cultural. And that's why sticking girls in bags for their entire lives and not letting them read

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       bad derisory it is, it's exactly what, it's exactly what happened

Speaker 3:          00:49:52       in, in Afghanistan. I'm not, I'm not talking about, again, I'm not talking about the voluntary.

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Uh, should you use a century language if you are here to convey love? It's exactly, it's like no because, no, because

Speaker 3:          00:50:04       pretend to love girls. If you're not as concerned as I am about this ms treatment of them.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       I don't pretend to understand, but you should. It's not for girls. They're girls and the Americans. It's not that you're overthinking it, you're overthinking. It has nothing to do with skin color knows what the level of thought. That's [inaudible] Sam, but you like, you know, you all in American,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       I can introduce you. Just take a few facts on board here. I can introduce you to women who have of what? Oh, whatever shade of Brown skin, you require my requirement, who holds about me, who have grown up in these cultures, who will say exactly what I'm saying about the consequences of compulsive gambling. No country, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:50:55       What do you say? No, but no subjugation is the same in yoga or exercise.

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       But you're, you're, you're, you're drawing the wrong lesson here. I'm, I'm back. No, no, no, because you're just missing a few facts. If you have those two people have a conversation. If you take someone like I on her cle or Sarah Haider who runs the ex Muslims of North America, right? And you have her talk to someone like Linda Sarsour, you know the Hijabi, uh, icon of the woman's March, right? Darlene, if the left now who's actually a closet theocrat and quite an nefarious person when you get her talking about religion, I mean she will, she will not admit that life for, for women in Saudi Arabia is, is bad by comparison at all for, with life for women in the West having such a complicit trades relationships with them. Then I'll agree with you there. So, but if you have two women have this sort talk, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       One Who has, who has taken off the hijab for reasons of not wanting to wear it and wanting to live in a system where she's free not to wear it, and one who says, I'm wearing it purely as an expression of my own religious faith and it's just pure women empower female empowerment. If you let that conversation proceed, you'll see that this side has to lie endlessly about the, the actual doctrines about why most people, most women, most of the time are wearing this there. It's being forced upon them. And maybe we'll talk about the misuse of power you're talking about. You're talking about mean to take, take the perfect case. It sounds like it's a thought experiment, but it actually happened. You take the religious police in Mecca who wouldn't let the girls who are burning alive in a dormitory be rescued because they weren't wearing their, their veils, right? They wouldn't let the firemen go in and rescue girls from a burning building because they weren't properly vale. But that's, that's the, that's the reductio ad absurdum this

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       gender relationships in this country have become so complex, particularly where we're both fathers, but you can judge the sure and the aesthetic obligations that will be placed upon my dor to look a certain way to behave a certain way to believe. So

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       I don't, I don't even think that's a reasonable possibility. I just think you are in a position to judge how wrong that would be and if someone is used to judge how wrong, what would be imposing those restrictions on your girls? You know, that would be a bad, a diminishment of the wellbeing of your girls and to pretend to not know what if a girl in Afghanistan

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       turning to this fish is in my idea. Why are you not more concerned that by the continual objectification

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       of women over that female sexuality, the advertising industry using females, it's a different order of problem, but I'm totally with you, but we just want these more prominent. What do you think is more likely to happen to your daughter? That she's going to be whisked off to Afghanistan? It's been wife number five or that she's going to have sex with some days because she's got that here. My concern is for both things, you consensually for reality, like an abstract ideas that play into the hands of an already a power dynamic and a well-served power dynamics. Let's get who's side are we all? But let's get, who does the grail serves I have, where is this mythic truth? Where does perennialism come from? Why are these themes found throughout the great faiths, the oneness, the unity, the possibilities for love. We're going Giddy Sam, we go for another ride in the tumble dryer of love.

Speaker 3:          00:54:22       So let me try to connect a few of these things because you're concerned about power, right? And you're concerned about the misuse of our power. We're so, so our being Western power say

Speaker 2:          00:54:35       I suppose it, but to tell the truth like now I've got ya. Okay. Like I don't even, I think that those, that mosque of nationalism is superficial. Let the real power operates and has done probably since British colonialism on an economic scale that doesn't pay a great deal of attention to sort of trade tariffs. All those very trade terrace have we drawn up, you know, we've the powerful in mind. So what for me, Sam, what interests me and not sort of like, while I, you know, I'm got no argument bloody isis when I read about that southern kingdom, some terrifying shit going down. But what interests me more is who is it that gets to determine what is happening in the world in my life right now? And it seems to me that, that that's transnational corporations and governments of Western democracies that don't need to resort to the kind of a sort of vivid acts of violence on their domestic population because it's unnecessary because we've all been beautifully conditioned and when it is required, when brutality and violence is required, it will be used. It is enacted. And that when me seems more important than people responding to that power, but it's all important. And then why is your focus continually on this sort of fetishized aspect?

Speaker 3:          00:55:47       Well, it's, it's, it's again, it was just to say fetishized is to, is to reveal the problem that I, that that causes me to focus on it. Because again, it comes back to the power of ideas. And I think one of the worst ideas going really is the one that you've expressed here, which is who am I to judge? I'm just a white guy who grew up in a western context. Who am I to judge the Burka, this, this kind of moral relativism, postmodernism. What? No, nobody. That'd be the, this, this is the order. This is, I know you don't wanna answer to that name, but this is the intellectual trend that gave us this kind of, uh, apprehension around making these judgments. Right? Who am I to to say what would be the good life for somebody else? And it, no matter how

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       grotesque the example of human suffering, nonviolence, compassion and love is the answer, I'm what I think where we disagree is what should be the key target. What is generating, generating the problems.

Speaker 3:          00:56:50       There are many problems, but I think to take it at the level of, of greatest abstraction, and I think greatest leverage for us to think about it is for the most part, we, this is not a problem of the world being filled with bad people, right? There are some bad people. There's some, it will say 1% of people in every culture are probably psychopaths, right? So there's 1% of people who really do feel no compunction about harming other people and they kind of get off on it and they're going to keep doing it no matter what you change about the system. Uh, but most harm is the result of bad ideas, good people having bad ideas and good people being in systems where there are bad incentives. And what I think we, so the crucial word here is incentives, right? I think we need economic systems and political systems and institutions and interpret and ways of being with one another publicly, uh, which align our incentives in such a way so as to make ordinary mediocre, not so insightful, not so reflective, not so philosophical.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       And frankly, not even that ethical people effort more and more effortlessly do the right thing, right? So you, you shouldn't have to be Saint Francis of Assisi to, to act well in the world, right? But there are systems where the incentives are bad enough that you really have to be a moral hero to be just basically decent. Right? All of the incentives are pointing the other way. Right? I'll take, give you an example for this. Um, life in a maximum security prison. So if you, you're a good guy, you're not a racist, you're a Jew. You want, you just want to get along with people. If you were put into a maximum security prison, all the incentives would be pushing you the other way. So for you, for you not to join a white gang in a maximum security prison would be effectively suicidal. Right? Like you would just be the victim of everyone so that the place is set up to segregate everyone by skin color, right? So even if you don't have a racist bone in your body,

Speaker 2:          00:58:53       you're just self preservation alone. They also concentrated society. Exactly. The royal institution. But it's the perfect, it's a perfect example of bad incentives are misaligned incentives, how these things happen. They're happening everywhere, but most of these, most of them, most of these exams,

Speaker 3:          00:59:13       samples of bad incentives are most that. Most of these examples of where power is victimizing millions and of people are, I would argue examples where the system is set up in such a way that it is reliably x sporting this misery. Right? And there's, there is no author of it. There is no bad person or they're very few bad people. Who are the actual authors of this, uh, of this human suffering there or the perpetrators of it. It what we have. Our systems were selfish people being selfish most of the time. Managed to export a fair amount of misery to tell people who are less lucky than themselves. And if we want to, if we want a fairer economic arrangement, we have to design it and we have to design it for people as they are. We have to, we need systems that will allow,

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       how about people are mutable? Yeah, exactly. Is that we respond to ideas and we respond to incentives. Yes. And incentives to be a bit more personal for a moment. Uh, like are you a bit cynical about human beings? Cause like when we talk it's like I feel we've been fighting about terrorism and, and uh, female gentlemen genital mutilation with my pro terrorism protein mutilation starts on those issues, um, shoulder to the wall now. But you seem so very, you seem like angry about you seem angry and about humanity. Almost all I know. Think human beings are not good

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       country. I see. Well they're neither, I mean we're, it's all mixed, right? I mean there were good and were bad and we're careless.

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       Right. And we're short side the line between good and evil runs through.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       Yeah, absolutely. That's certainly a more eloquent way of saying it, but it, it is, but there's

Speaker 4:          01:01:07       okay

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       the, again, to talk about the, the, the, the situational problem, the,

Speaker 4:          01:01:13       yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:01:14       The problem of incentives is doing more work than human evil is doing. I mean, I think, again, I think we, all of us have, have work to do on ourselves to be happier and better people. Right? And that is spiritual life and that is ethical life. But I think, I think better than, and this, these are not, these are not mutually exclusive projects. These can be done simultaneously, but better than each of us figuring out how to be a saint, um, would be to design a system that made it easier for everyone to be far better than they're tending to be now. And that's possible. I think that's absolutely, literally

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       possible to a lot of decentralization and the significant change, particularly in, in our nations around what is called the political. But I sort of see as the religious now let, let me tell you something again. It's again a little more, what do I want to say? Trivial. So personal. It's not trivial. I A, the other day I was driving home from, and I've seen the movie or something. It was a daytime, still a homeless guy just collapsed laying in the middle of the road, you know, it's La homeless people just everywhere forming shanty

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       towns like the apocalypse is already happened and is creeping in around us. Like it's slow tide and it was some homeless guy and like, Oh, I know that homeless guy is just laying there. I should do something about that. Amanda didn't, I just went home and I thought like, ah, why didn't I do anything about that?

Speaker 3:          01:02:39       Great example here. So, okay, it's because in the current system there's nothing very easy to do, right? So like, so you have to be an absolute moral hero to do something about that particular homeless guy. And it's very likely that what you would do wouldn't help a lot and would just complicate your life massively. So let's say you just say, well, this is totally untenable. I cannot step over the body of yet another homeless person. I'm going to take this guy into my life. He's going to come back to my hotel room. I'm going to, you know, I, I've got to go to London in a week. I'm going to figure out what to do with this guy and get him in and it's going to be your whole project

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       then a couple of times. Yeah, it's complex.

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       Yeah. It's called [inaudible]. So the reason why he's lying on the side, there are many reasons why he's lying on the sidewalk and probably those reasons aren't immediately actionable by you. Um, now what we need is a system that recognizes the problem of homelessness in the most compassionate and pragmatic way and figures out what, whatever solution there is. What, you know, there's substance abuse issues, there's mental health issues, there's, there's zoning issues. There's like, I mean, we, we the, there's this not in my backyard ism that where people are just getting pushed to different parts of the city because you don't see this in Beverly Hills, but you see this in Santa Monica, right? We have to figure out a solution that is compassionate and, and

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       so do you think poverty is the relegation of spiritual principles? The fact that broadly speaking, culturally spiritual principles and for been relegated to the point of almost insignificant. So it's sort of no longer feels like a sort of a person or ge to help homeless people. Of course as you set the systems aren't in place. One wonders what would happen if I just sort of put him over my shoulder and tried to take him somewhere. I know it happened shelters would be full complex medical issues, issues of finance, but then you think there's sort of this sort of idea of individual ism and individual freedom kind of relieved, still sort of be somehow favors primal and selfish drives over sort of communal fraternal drives. And whilst I agree with you on that baby bath water dynamic, I don't think we do enough to, uh, to focus on, uh, luminate and present the baby, the baby that is spirituality.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       That is, you need to kind of things that we're, you know, when you're meditating for two years in silence and when you're continuing to meditate now probably when you're doing Brazilian Jujitsu, shrong senses or fraternity, togetherness, oneness. How do we, for me, I think that the pro, the priority, the most useful way of getting those values into our culture is to demonstrate them to confront power where possible and necessary. And it seems to me less significant. And this is what I'm fascinated by, the to attack focus on the arguments that you have focusing on and

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       arguments you've been brilliantly making and pricing about sort of we sort of sort of wonderfully pos or disagree is it has become evident on many of the tenets of it. So that for me they, well I suppose what I'm saying, it's all, and people like you and I who believe in spirituality, you believe in compassion. We believe in love be doing more to elevate those values. I'm doing that a lot when I talk about meditation and spirituality and wellbeing and ethics a lot is it got the highest base. Got Behavioral. I know you have to be a chairman of that deal with you know, secularism and all that kind of thing and of be like, you know, how does that convert into, you know, bought a boots on the ground, love for other humans?

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       Well we do talk about what the ground truth is here, man. We have consciousness and its contents in each moment. I mean that's, that's what our lives are. We have, we have changing states of consciousness and this is all there is to care about is that all there is to care about our changes for good or for ill in conscious creatures like ourselves. So if you love someone, you care that they be happy and that they no longer suffer or if they suffer, they suffer in ways that are productive, that lead to an even deeper states of wellbeing. It's not like we're just pure hedonists. There's this kinds of suffering that that lead lead that has a silver lining that gets us somewhere worth going. But when you're talking about finding meaning in life and making meaning together in community, you're talking about just what kind of, what it's like to be you. Are you talking about consciousness and we are. We are. We actually know a lot about how to improve states of human consciousness and creativity and aesthetic beauty and ethical interactions and not lying and treating people the way you would want to be treated. Something like a precept, like the golden rule. Super useful. And as I can say, that's a great, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:15       PC software under the heading of baby, right? This, this is okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       Yeah, but you don't, but they don't, they don't only come from scripture and there people had these ideas outside of religious traditions. You can find Greek philosophers who've said all this,

Speaker 2:          01:07:29       right? Yeah, but, but, but nothing, nothing has, nothing has to be believed on insufficient evidence to use these ideas and to find them compelling. Yeah, no, of course I agree with you or you don't have to all I believe that. And there's a cost to believing any dogma that the problem is any dog, any dogma, it's costly. Well, it depends what those look like. They are the price. Now, the collateral damage of our culture. Sam, are you confident that individual consciousness, like my individual Russell brand consciousness and your individual Sam Harris consciousness, are distinct, separate things that are not qualitatively similar, if not ultimately the same? I

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       know there is zero scientific evidence to suggest that all consciousness is one, but it would given you your research scientifically and personal, spiritual, uh, investigations. Is there anything that suggest to you that consciousness is a phenomena, maybe universal?

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       Well, it's universal in the sense that that is simply the fact of experience is that there's the fact that there's something that is like to be you. And there's something that has liked to be me. And so it's almost analogous to space. It's like we, it's like the space in this room, uh, is, is seamless, right? And, and undivided. And you ask yourself, well, so what, what about the space? Like what about the space inside this water bottle? Well, where's or what like where is the water bottle with reference to space? Well, it's the only place it can be. It's, it's, it's right there where the water bottle is by move it, it moves. But it's, it's, there's no other place. It's so to ask if you're asking about the space, uh, it has, it has a kind of sameness regardless of what object in that space you're talking about. And consciousness has that property, at least conceptually. Now we don't know how consciousness arises in the physics of things. We don't know if it's a product of, of, yeah. I mean there's certainly good reason to believe that it is, but we don't know how far down it goes. It's probably could be a fundamental constituent of matter or it could arise on the basis of assemblies of neurons. Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       The good reason to believe that it comes from Matt, that the more complex an organism is, the more evidence of functioning rational consciousness there is. He's

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       Wa it's a me, just again here you sort of start the universe from the big bang. Right. And the idea that, um, I mean we, we find complex arrangements of matter giving rise to different emergent properties and life is one of those properties. And you know, and all of the features of life, reproduction and, and, and metabolism and, and, uh, the, the order we see in, in the natural world is the result of a process of increasing complexity. And at the end of some significant period, I mean, in our case, you know, billions of years, you find organisms that exhibit the properties of consciousness, but that, but the only, the only consciousness we're sure of 100% sure of is the consciousness in our own case. Now we can reason by analogy. We look at dogs and other complex animals. And we can say, well, to imagine that, that they don't have consciousness but only seemed to have it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       That's actually not parsimonious. And because I mean, they're so similar to us, you know, neurologically and in every other way that to imagine that the lights come on somewhere between them and us seems irrational. But how far down that goes is anybody's guess. And intuitions really divides. If you ask, most neuroscientists are philosophers of mind, is there something that is like to be a fly? Right? This got 100,000 neurons in his brain. Um, people just, you know, it's that kind of coin toss right now. I think there is, um, again, so it could be, again, we, we simply don't know at what point consciousness emerges and, but it's, it's possible that single cells are conscious in some way. Right? I mean that's, that like that wouldn't, you wouldn't expect the, the, the living world to appear differently if cells were conscious. Right. Um, but it is, it would be genuinely mysterious because when you look at the human brain, there seems to be a lot of neural activity. In fact, most neural activity that is not associated with what you experience as consciousness or I experienced as consciousness from a first person side. So

Speaker 1:          01:12:14       what motion you're activity is not related to yeah, most, most anatomical biological stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:12:19       Yeah. I mean, yeah, most of what your brain is doing isn't showing up in your first person experience as conscious

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       at that age. Just like a cherry on the cake, the kidneys in the plan. But it's the, but it's the,

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       the thing that ultimately matters, right? I mean, so the content and, and it's the only thing that, that any of us can be absolutely sure of and said this is, this is my line about consciousness being the only thing in the universe that can't be an illusion. I'm not that, I'm not the first person to say this obviously, but the, um, it's the only thing that is, has to be true of us no matter how mistaken we might be a better everything else. So if this, if we're on in the matrix right now, and this is just a, you know, we're just living in a simulation on some alien supercomputer and none of what we think is real is actually real. Consciousness is still real. And the consciousness is just simply the fact that anything seems to be happening at all. Or if you're really asleep and dreaming right now and we're not really doing this podcast, you're totally confused about your actual circumstance. But you're actually not confused about the fact that your conscious,

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       oh, that would explain why I've got no trousers and pants. I was, I was hoping you had trousers. Like, see how you just described consciousness, then it's potentially sort of a construction then suddenly up personal consciousness that we can be set and is not an illusion. Many of you know about, you know, sort of the Mahara Mahabharata and the back of our Gita and many of these ideas are sort of using a vernacular that is naturally termin by the time in which it was conceived. It talks about these ideas that mayor illusion, uh, that and, and, and for me like that because of like, like he also said that list of values that would be useful and which I've said, oh, well they have their part of the baby in the bath water, aren't they? It seems to me that possibly within, uh, like if can somehow extract what is positive from a, what is called religion, that it might, it leads us to ideas such as fraternity, unity, oneness, compassion and like with the, or do you not find, uh, I, and now connections between what you have learned in neuroscience and what you've learned from studying sort of Buddhism.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       Oh yeah. The connections are very direct, but

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       how'd they know that stuff?

Speaker 3:          01:14:40       But we, but we don't want well but just because it's, it's just the nature of consciousness is you, you're talking about people who have spent, especially in the Buddhist case, I just an incredible amount of time studying from aunt, from the first person side. What experiences, like what his character is, what one analogy would be. Um, the central, the central claim of Buddhism is not just Buddhism but, but um, Buddhism and I would put several of the Indian traditions like Advaita Vedanta in there with the central claims at the, the self is an illusion. The EGO is an illusion. Where, and when I say self, I don't mean that people are illusions. I mean that the sense that you have a subject riding around in your head thinking your thoughts right there. That there's a thinker in addition to the thoughts. That's an illusion. And that makes perfect sense.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       Neurologically, there's no, there's no place in the brain for your ego to be sitting. There's no central place where everything comes together. There's no unchanging center in the brain. You're just talking about a cascade of neurophysiology and everything is distributed everywhere and it's not a, and there are various parts of the brain that are coming online and off and, and, and subserving conscious dates and not, it's, it's a, it's a process and there is there if you could experience consciousness as a flow of sensory and emotional and interoceptive experience without a, the sense that there's an unchanging center riding around on that flow, right? Like a man in a boat on the, on the stream of consciousness. Yes. Um, if you could experience that consciousness without that, that would be an experience that is much more coincident with what we understand neurologically it that would be, that would be to experience something that is more true from the third person brain-based, what do we see inside the head side?

Speaker 3:          01:16:44       And it just so happens you can't experience that. That is just, that is how that is what meditation is like when you really know how to meditate. This sense that there's a meditator in the head strategically paying attention to experience rather than just pure experience that drops away. Right. So that's, this is one, that's one piece of data in favor of, of the, of introspection here. And it's not, it's not a piece that the western intellectual tradition or the West or the western spiritual tradition ever got a good hand handle on. I mean, so yes, you can find specific Christian and Jewish and Muslim mystics making these noises, but they make the, when they make these noises sufficiently, they start to sound like Buddhists and their co-religionists want to kill them rather often.

Speaker 1:          01:17:28       The religionists the powerful, uh, and ease within nation states and economic life. People start believing they're not individuals. It's very out to market at them.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       Yeah. But we haven't had a lot of problems, people with people being killed for not doing enough shopping and shopping malls because, cause I,

Speaker 1:          01:17:45       unless there's a shoe in, in the shopping mall and that's the stuff they buy in the shopping mall, kill some. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:17:49       I looked. But if you look at the history of Christianity and Judaism and Islam, you find people who, I mean, these are explicitly dualistic traditions. You have a soul, you have a soul that exists in relationship to the divine and that division,

Speaker 1:          01:18:06       it's maintain the theological, I would say sam high risk. The reason that bifurcation occurred is precisely because I wear man's relationship with the divine prioritized in the manner that you've just been describing. That seems a neurologically Apisai where that to become our priority and materialistic, let's call it lifestyle and mechanistic, social mechanistic social systems such as the ones that we inhabit would be less, uh, fertile. Because if people believed that the ultimate reality was not being experienced by the self, that there was no self that, that, that and binds us, that makes oneness a real possibility. That starts to suggest that your consciousness and my consciousness ultimately are the same. Or at least there's nothing to suggest that there are any different. And that the things that we believe to be different, a superficial, uh, accents acquired through culture,

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       that's also true materially. And I, and we shouldn't give the material short trip because the material progress is the thing that frees attention to, I mean, so I mean, just, you roll back the clock long enough, you find people living in just perpetual states of trying not to die, right? And you're like, you know, you're, you're fending off wild animals. You're exposed to the elements. You're, you're, you're suffering the consequences of disease and you have no concept of what disease is, right? You don't know about the germ theory of disease and you and your child dies and you think it's because the, your neighbor, she shined the evil eye on the child, right? I mean, so it's like, it's, you have magical beliefs accounting for changes in the world and they're, they're completely fallacious, right? So the progress we've made in understanding that the material world is all to the good, except we have all of these misaligned incentive problems and, um, externalized damages to two very good things and be like, you want an iphone.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Right? But you don't want people jumping off the roof of foxconn because life is such, it's so painful they're being to, to make an iphone. Right. Um, so is it possible to make an iphone without creating just unendurable misery for some number of people? Undoubtedly. It must be true, right? We haven't, we haven't figured it out yet. Uh, so as to make that the default and we need to do that. But we, you know, there's nothing, there is no, there is no distance between the material and the spiritual here. I mean, so cause if consciousness is just a matter of, of information processing in, in the, the right complex systems and if consciousness could one day be born in our computers, right, well then we'll have an ethical obligation to, to not make our computer suffer. Right. If Siri could suffer, right, well then it matters how you talk to her, you know, and it would matter every, oh yeah, I want to complicate life.

Speaker 3:          01:21:10       Um, and we're not obviously not there yet or it certainly seems obvious that we're not there yet, but at a certain point we will very likely either be in the presence of conscious machines or think we are right. We'll lose sight of the they'll, they'll emulate conscious systems in a compelling enough way that our default will be, I'm in relationship to this thing now. And, and to withdraw a sense of consciousness in that case would seem, um, just unprincipled and unethical and we'll have, we'll have, we, we, we, we could well build machines that seem to have emotional lives and even have more richer emotional lives than we do because they're going to have access to all of human knowledge, all of human, uh, all of the aesthetic products of, of human ingenuity for all of history. And they'll be able to talk about them and appreciate them and remind you of how much you love certain things and, and react to your emotion faster and more accurately than your best friends or your or your spouse.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       Right. We could bill, ultimately, we will very likely build these machines. And if we have an understood how consciousness arises in physical systems, will think they're conscious and we will maybe right or wrong about that. And, and whether we're right or wrong about that will be a huge consequence because, you know, it would be, it would be, uh, um, it would be an absolutely abhorrent act to build conscious systems that can suffer in ways we don't even understand. And just, just to cavalierly, you know, spawn this off in simulations and, you know, on the Amazon cloud and not know what the hell we're doing.

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       For me that of course we've already created like the, this is not just a hypothesis because already all around us as we've already, fleetingly discussed, lie scattered, they're damaged and broken and presumably conscious entities that are fellow human beings, our fellow English, but in America, Americans scattered and broken around us. And Sam, uh, so for me there's two points to Raha cause we've got a much longer than I intended to. Sure. It was trippy how like, uh, like, you know, there's, there's quite a lot of questions still.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       I'm, I'm fine on time so you can just, I'll see if I can do as one tumble dryer, one s whirling neurological sprawl. One evening

Speaker 1:          01:23:32       we stick regurgitation. Uh, in your general direction. Here are the things that interest me. One on a podcast I was listening to you do once a like an, it's a, it's an idea that sort of more commonly understood that possibly freewill is an illusion that decisions are made prior. So morality and ethics sort of suffer some what if that's true too?

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       I don't think that final part holds are person. Or you can have your morality and ethics without free will. Can I have morality and ethics without free? But they roll it by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:24:07       Evaluate them. Has to be sort of looked at differently. Do it in one big, let me do my vomit. Girlfriend used to use back. Yours is more piecemeal. Mine's a sort of a literal slu. Yours says it has all sorts of rationalism and academia to bill on this. Of a what? Minecraft. A beautiful architecture. Um, so Sam Harris, the other thing is when you were a, when you've taken psychedelics, did you not experience a things that comparable to what you described is neurologically demonstrable and what you've experienced in, in, in meditation, I sense that your individual identity is a sort of, uh, uh, confection of sort of ideas and sensation and that there isn't sort of a, a beautiful oneness. I myself taking Alicia, Jenny, I'm clean now for 15 years, but prior to that, when I used to take hallucinogens, the thing I didn't have the vocabulary, artillery or education to understand what, what the hell was going on.

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       And I wish I'd been born into some sort of shamanic tradition where people taught you what spirit is. When they tell you what it used to be, a man, what they're taught you, what love is, and how to behave and how to create systems and how to father a daughter and how to take care of regardless. I experienced something within my identity. I seemingly be on my identity as a 16 year old boy. I remember thinking, Oh my God, this is not who I am. I am not this body. My consciousness is other than this in temporarily individuated form that only the distinction. And uh, you know, even just on the, on a physics level, like everything was one, everything is expanding. I am only experiencing time in an animalistic way because of my own entropy and atrophy where I are limitless in a terminal material being, I would see myself as part of the whole, as part of oneness because the way that I narrativize my life is as a result of biocentric experience as opposed to objective experience.

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       I've just been subjected to this stimuli and I've built an identity around it. It felt extremely true and it stayed with me ever since. And I've revisited it through meditation there. Uh, aside from it being a, an interesting experience intellectually is an interesting experience emotionally and spiritually. And if this sense of oneness does not translate into a sort of a personal ethical code, that means I treat people lovingly. What is its value? So it's two questions. Have you experienced that state and what do you think of it are moral and ethical implications on an individual? And what does it, how does it translate into behavior?

Speaker 3:          01:26:39       Well, well, there are two states I would want to differentiate. There are two ways in which you can think about the loss of self and the sense of oneness. So, um, with psychedelics, you get to come back to what I said before. You have consciousness and its contents, right? There's just, there's the fact that things are appearing. There was the fact that there is experience and consciousness is the knowing aspect of experience. And nor in the normal course of events you have, you know, ordinary sights and sounds and smells and sensations and thoughts and emotions. And you go through, and most people go through life thinking every moment of the day in the car, in that context. And they don't know how to meditate. They don't know. They don't have any mindfulness. Uh, they have this sort of white noise of discursivity where they're talking to themselves and everything they see and, and, and sense.

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       And every interaction is filtered through this conversation they're having with themselves and the world they see visually and, and uh, uh, you know, the world they sense with, you know, with touch and other senses is tiled over with concepts. So you, I, I look at a bottle and I see bottle, right? I'm not the, this, this field of light and shadow and color is differentiated by concepts. I see my phone, I see a bottle, I see the table and everything is solidified that way. Now what happens with psychedelics is your, your habit pattern of thought and attention is completely bowled over by the pharmacology of whatever you've just ingested, right? So if it's acid or mushrooms or, um, any of those classic psychedelics, it's just whoever you are, whatever your talents are at introspection, we know whether you've ever wanted to meditate or not. Um, you are guaranteed to have a change in your experience.

Speaker 3:          01:28:31       If you take a sufficient dose of a psychedelic. Now it can be a very chaotic and unpleasant change. You can, it can mimic psychosis right there. You can, a bad acid trip is really bad and not spiritually uplifting at all. Uh, but a good one can put you in a state which is just unimaginably expansive where it like all of this, then the normal, uh, pro kind of perceptual categories and, and emotional barriers between you and the world breakdown. And there can be this kind of like just this free as free flowing exchange of energy and sense of oneness the way, or you can, you know, you touch a tree with your hand and the, and the, and the, the, there's, there can be kind of a laser like concentration in the sensation of just having your hand make contact with the tree. And they can be just as the sense of just, you know, the energy, the energy of that touch, right.

Speaker 3:          01:29:29       Can become, it's like you turn, you're turning up the volume on this channel of information and making it conscious in a way that it never is in, in normal life. And so you just, you could spend two hours just in this kind of orgasmic union with a tree, right? I on the right drug now, um, you can do all, you can have all of those changes happen in your consciousness. You know, like the full pyrotechnics of a psychedelic display without losing the sense of an ego you can actually have at all. You can still feel that there, that you are the center of that and you're just, you're just, it's just so much better. Uh, or in the chaotic, you know, psychotics side, so much worse to be you at that moment. Now for me, meditation has a very, if, if you, if you go an intensive retreat and you're spending, you know, 12 to 18 hours a day meditating, you can have psychedelic light changes in the contents of consciousness.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       But the more important change for me is the insight that there is no center to consciousness, that there was simply is consciousness and everything appearing. And when you have that insight, it actually doesn't matter what is appearing. It doesn't matter if you, when you touch the tree, it feels like, you know, a million watts of, of sublime energy and there's no barrier between unit you and the tree, uh, that is the same on some fundamental level. That's the same as just seeing a water bottle and picking it up and having a drink in a completely otherwise ordinary state of consciousness. The center can drop out equally or be present equally in both of those cases. And I'm much more interested in finding this, this unifying experience of centerless snus in the midst of whatever's happening. And because of the, the problem with the psychedelic experience or, or any peak experiences that is that they come and go, they're there.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       They're by nature, impermanent, right. And they, they, you had to bring some causes and conditions together to make them happen. Whether they're pharmacological or Meditational, you know, he had to go on retreat for a year and, and meditate 18 hours a day in order to see those, you know, in or lights or whatever it was. Um, and or you had to, you know, kind of blow your mind on acid and be kind of useless for the rest of the day. Um, uh, in order to have that, it, it's possible to have no ego and have none of the problems which an ego gives you in a state of otherwise totally ordinary consciousness in it, in a state that's compatible with having this conversation. It's just you either feel like there's someone behind your face in this moment or not. That's really what it is. Like it's like if you're looking at me and I'm looking at you, the usual, the default state of consciousness is to feel like you're behind your face looking out at a world that's not self.

Speaker 3:          01:32:28       Like you're over there, you're kind of behind the mask that is your face and you're looking at me and that's the end. And when I look at you, when I react to something you say, right? When I say, well, that's clearly bullshit way, hey, you haven't thought that through that feeling of you know, my point in it like this, you're implicated over there, right? And you begin to react based on that implication. It's possible a lose that and to have like just just the world remains and yet nothing else changes their doesn't. There's no strange lights. There's no Kundalini in the body. There's nothing. Nothing has to get weird or psychedelic and uh, it doesn't matter if it does get weird.

Speaker 1:          01:33:08       No and I please know you'll write that there is a of if there is no pragmatism to spirituality, if there isn't a practical application to these extreme experiences within consciousness, then what is their value? My feeling is is that the sort of linguistics and grammar of mechanics, the apparent separateness, the meaning of gesture, they're very notion of you and die. There are moments where I experienced it as temporal. There are moments where to use the Great Bill Hicks is I think perfect phrase. I feel that we are one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. When you talk about the loss of the being behind the mask of the face for me this is, we are talking about enlightenment and [inaudible]. Are you talking about rather ascetic version of that without bells and whistles and pyrotechnics to use your earlier phrase. But similarly when you talk about the Psychedelic, that sort of very emotional description of connection and love.

Speaker 1:          01:34:17       For me, these are the kinds of experiences that we need to convey into an environment that deprived of that kind of experience and understanding create maximum security prisons, which find further means for degradation in gangs and separation. Once within that we are living perhaps in a time that is for me to turn it around by the extraction of the spiritual as opposed to the, because of the amplification of it. And for me, the, uh, the distinction that you and I have in the way we view the world is that I feel that the main agent in extracting this element of spirit without, which I don't see a solution for the 7 billion people on this planet, that the main agent is post secular capitalist culture and religion.

Speaker 3:          01:35:17       Well, no, it's not only religion, but it's, it's dogmatism. It's bad ideas that, that are immune from criticism and, and therefore remain effective. So what we need, well, again, it comes back to conversation and violence. We need successful conversations. We need to converge. We need to find the thing that can be said so as to get the people who are wrong to recognize it, right? And that's, that's all of us some of the time, right? Like if it's like, like how long do you want to be wrong for, you know, how long do you want to be living under the sway of a powerful, bad idea? Now there are people who have powerful bad ideas that they class as religious, who, who are determined to live the rest of their lives under the sway of those ideas, no matter how much evidence piles up against them and no matter what the consequences. And so that's why religion for me, it has a special character, but political dogmatism is in many cases, just as problematic. Economic dogmatism, economic dogmatism in certain cases could be the greatest engine of harm we ever see, right? So it's just, but it's, it's, again, it matters what is true. It matters. It matters what causes systems to work or to reliably fail.

Speaker 1:          01:36:36       It does sound. And given that I think in the last few minutes of our conversation, we've got close to something that seems like a fundamental truth that we can agree on that there seems to be some essence behind temporal individuality that has some kind of seeming university allity though. How could anybody ever possibly really say that it is, if we can bring our focus as individuals and as a society to that notion and notion which does exist in all religions, uh, in, uh, I would say in a relegated role. And as you said earlier in a role that, you know, when Mr [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:37:12       what's the reason to say that it exists in all religions? Because what if it doesn't like what, what then or what if it doesn't equally or what if much of the, of the religion repudiates this core truth?

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       Well, I would say that you and I are having the same conversation and agree about something fundamental. And, and to elect to disagree for the purposes of hypotheses would be a silly thing to do because within Christianity, as you've already said, there's a mystical tradition within Islam. There is within Buddhism, it's sort of more practically delineates in gin is I don't know what religion, religions, I don't enough about it. But what I'm saying is, is it like that what excites me is when I see perennial mythic template recurring through folk law, faith Montefiore's in pantheism that all seem to infer the truth that you are personally describing that you have psychedelically described that you have neurologically describes me,

Speaker 3:          01:38:06       don't. But it's very important to realize that they don't all do it equally and to pay lip service to the idea that they're all teaching the same thing equally well is creating, I would argue an immense amount of harm,

Speaker 1:          01:38:20       but it's some trinity a lot, but there are some dogmas and doctrines, but say it doesn't exist and that is relevant and that it's not there at all. So I don't think like say take our two countries. I don't think the dominant ideology ideologies are drawn from religion. They're drawn from sort of a sort of, uh, posting lightened meant rational materialistic ideas and from economic ideas and colonial ideas and post a Westphalian tree ideas of state and nation and power. You know, people aren't going to like the big problems aren't derived from a sort of a religious source. And if they are, they are the very component that share those qualities with nonreligious power structures. The important thing and the thing that is not present almost by definition in a secular culture is this idea of essence and truth other than through mechanistic exploration through science, which whilst as you have already eh, brilliantly explained, easy and valuable it cause like, I know you've done talks that particular that directly contradict this, but we can't answer the questions of the experience of essence yet. And perhaps one day we will perhaps one day we will. But so it seems to me that there's some fighting

Speaker 3:          01:39:40       one example that I think ties together a lot of what we disagree about here and, and it, it crystallizes the, the point I am urging you to take seriously, uh, and the don't take it serious.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       Take it off.

Speaker 3:          01:39:55       This particular point, the mentors, let me just crystallize this point. Uh, and it's, it's the, the problem of dogmatism, why dogmatism is, is, is basically always bad and unforeseeably bad. You can net, you can't in advance know how bad a dogma is going to be just by considering that the, the sentence on paper, uh, but the dogmatism is just the wrong methodology for, for getting anywhere worth going because it is the antithesis of, of open conversation. And so, and this is the example that I now always used because it's just, it just is so clear the, the dogma that all human life is equally sacred, all human lives are equally valuable and that life starts at the first moment, the moment of conception right now, this on its face, if you just told me if 20 years ago you said, what if someone who believes this, what does he, what sort of needless human misery is he going to manufacturer? I would say, well, is just a totally, this is the most benign thing you could possibly believe. Who, who's going to get killed in the service of this dogma, right? Who's going to have be be tortured for decades in the service of this dogma. But when you look at what people have traditionally done with this specific idea, and this is a Judeo Christian,

Speaker 1:          01:41:11       the American constitution, nationalistic,

Speaker 3:          01:41:15       no, but, but, but especially this, this the link to the moment of conception. You, you, you'll look at the millions of Americans who opposed embryonic stem cell research, right? With all the promise that held right here, we have petri dishes filled with, it's imagined, you know, hundreds of human souls that, that are microscopic and to kill those souls would be tantamount to murder. To experiment on those souls would be tantamount to murder and therefore they didn't want to have a conversation about all of the, the children and adults with, with life deranging injuries and diseases who might've been helped had that, had progress been made in that area. Now that is a psychotic moral attitude made possible by the most benign seeming dogma, right? I mean literally we're talking about people who, if you could

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       just one aspect of it and they said an understandable squeamishness about human life and we've all seen that the little baby pro life type images and stuff. But also Sam, there's an ongoing dialectic between the scientific community and religious community who's got the right to be the dominant, the parental figure in ownership of the public sphere and the public's Seoul in inverted commerce. So like, you know, there's a lot of kick back at Vista kickback from Christian groups over the sort of, you know, like evidently beneficial scientific endeavors,

Speaker 3:          01:42:37       barely held belief is I, I believe so, but interest the Zygote at the moment of conception and then therefore I'm worried.

Speaker 1:          01:42:43       And is it sort of an interesting sort of notion and I, you know, I think you and I would be on the same side of that particular argument clearly, but like, but what I would say is that we need to again revert to focusing on what is truly divine or sublime. These moments of interconnectivity and oneness. And then we wouldn't need trash talismans to be placeholders for meaning in a culture that has lost its meaning. I would say in significant part because the role of the spiritual has been relegated to meaninglessness in favor of a materialistic mechanistic, culturally that leads ultimately to sort of widespread consumerism and uh, and uh, so, and consciousness and consciousness that we are continually in that world of it. I reiterative for constant tangled thought that because people have no experience of the sublime of the divine or,

Speaker 3:          01:43:36       but again, I, I wouldn't, um, miss you have your own fetishistic objects, like, like this notion of consumerism, right? So a consumer, like you and I are having this conversation in a podcast studio at headspace, right? Headspace. Is it a meditation APP that on, on, on the one hand is the quintessence of consumerism. I mean, this is something that only happens in a smartphone right there. The various phone that I was talking about this causing people to jump off rooftops, right? So, and yet, I think headspace is absolutely good thing to have out there. And it's, and, and it is, it's, it's bringing a incredibly useful practice to millions of people. Um, and podcasts bring incredibly useful conversations to millions of people. All of this is enabled by mere materialism and mirror consumerism. And it's, there's a, has to be an ethical and spiritually correct way to do all this. It's not a matter of getting rid of the microphones and getting rid of the smartphones. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       no, no, I'm not suggesting that. I'm just the same way as you would pause it there. Is there an extremist and dangerous version of Islam, which I would say has the, I don't think he's an essentially malevolent idea. I would disagree with that strongly. Uh, I would say that, uh, people having objects isn't necessarily wrong, but to fetishize objects and to believe that it's some kind of fulfillment and spiritual solution can be achieved through the acquisition of objects is dangerous and all the more dangerous because it's not so explicitly understood. But that's what's happening. That the, the, the, the, the, the extremist ideology that we already live with in is so all encompassing that we cannot see it's horizons that we have lost the tools to understand it and describe it. I'm not talking about sort of a post Stalinist leftist position. I'm talking about the reinvention and the reembracing of the human soul.

Speaker 1:          01:45:33       Can we find that you've talked a Sam endlessly about we need to have a conversation. Well, you and I are having a conversation. I believe in God. You don't believe in God. And it turns out that the differences aren't actually when it boils down to it that meaningful. Because when it comes to love of our daughters freedom, compassion, we ultimately believe the same things. I think that that unless you and I can find a way of saying, okay, I respect that. I, you know, like a lot of my, the people whose guidance I seek, uh, most, uh, earnestly are atheists, but that, that doesn't change. The fact that I believe that there is, there is, there are levels of consciousness that are beyond material phenomena that will net will never understand free magnifications of the human senses or further analysis of, uh, of the material objects because there are limitations to the human mind, you know, and, and ultimately [inaudible]. Importantly, Sam, I also think that all of this stuff, all of this, uh, a theorial wittering has no meaning unless it translates into love and compassion. Unless there is some meaning in the idea that there is some connection between a tree in a hand if you achieve the correct mental state.

Speaker 3:          01:46:47       Yeah, I mean, again, there are wrinkles here that I just want to flag. One is that extreme and mental pleasure is divorced from ethics. So for instance, to go back to this, this perverse case that we started with suicide bombing, I, I have good reason to believe that the mental state of a suicide bomber before he thinks euphoric. Yes, yes. I, we're not talking about suicidal people who are just trying to end the depression as fast as possible. We're talking about people who are on the cusp of the,

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       the deepest spiritual reward that summer's Tommy, we stopped on miss. Take a person, like a policeman that's willing to risk his own life to rescue, rescue a child in Japanese. Similarly, their regard for their own life is being abandoned in that moment. And that too could be described as a kind of euphoria because it like, it happens to fit in with our worldview. We're cool with it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:43       Yeah. Well, yeah. And, and, and, but so that's what I'm saying, the real consequences for human beings matter and it's possible to, I mean, euphoria is something and in a sense of meaning is something that can be totally misaligned with what I think we would agree is an actual ethical relationship and an actual spiritual insight. And so that's it. So, so euphoria is not a perfect guide. It can be very misleading guide for wisdom and compassion. That's, that's the point. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       It's true of Nixon bloody bad decisions as a result.

Speaker 3:          01:48:17       Yeah. And so, and, and the absence of euphoria can also be misleading because you can, they're, they're genuinely like what I just said about this kind of non dual experience in meditation. You can, you can have it in a very subtle way that doesn't have, doesn't summon him at least, certainly doesn't immediately summon some radical change in your, your, the feeling tone of your experience. It can be, it can be as simple as just looking at a water bottles, you know, and, and it's just, you know, it's just the lights are on and there's no center. Now you can feel that for just a moment and not recognize it's revolutionary significance because it doesn't come with the upwelling of, of rapture or bliss that people associate with good meditation or, or a psychedelic experience or, or ordinary religiosity like feelings of love while chanting or singing in church or, or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       Or a football match where they're like, yeah, there are various contexts in which these states can be achieved. And I suppose what I believe is that we should be looking to create the state's prioritize the states and give more people access to them through whatever means, you know, certainly I don't agree with the imposition of an ideology of Dogma on anybody else, you know? And I can tell and I think the key obstacles to that are a huge centralized power bases. And then without the removal of that, I don't see how there could be a solution.

Speaker 3:          01:49:41       Yeah, well we, you know, I don't, I don't know how much we disagree about all that. I mean, haven't, again, it's all a matter of alternatives. It's like it's, you know, democracy seems impressively broken to me and capitalism seems impressively broken to me, except the alternatives seem worse. I mean, this is, this is a Winston Churchill, so, but, but no, but I think we just need to find our way, but just recognize what we're doing. We are, we're trying to grab whatever lever or dial we can get within reach to change the human experience in predictably benign and ultimately positive way. Do you feel much fear in life? Do you feel afraid much like in your tummy? I mean in your brain?

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       It's more in my brain than it. Well, I mean, no it's not. It's not that I can't feel fear I, but, but the things that I worry about publicly as a matter of, you know, being someone who talks and writes about these things is not indicative of my feeling adrenalized and fearful all the time. I mean, it's not the, that you can, you can worry about new. I mean that actually the thing that worries me most again at the brain level is that the greatest risks to human wellbeing are hard to take seriously. It's like, I mean, they're the people who think, who professionally think about nuclear war and, and new and the consequences of proliferation and people like William Perry, you know, that the, I guess he's close to 90 now. He was 85.

Speaker 4:          01:51:22       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:51:24       these people think that we are at the most dangerous place we've been in the last 75 years with respect to the likelihood of, of a nuclear exchange. Right. So as I could like think the Cold War is not only not over, it is like from from Paris point of view, we are in another Cuban missile crisis right now. And nobody's worried about Russia or Korea. Well, the, yeah, all of it. Yeah. But I mean I think, I think it's the possibility of a mistake. I mean, the book I would, I would recommend your listeners read, which should make them suitably afraid is Eric Schlosser's book command and control, which is just a story of how many mishaps and how many, how, how haphazard our stewardship of these nuclear weapons has been. It's just, it's been by dent of sheer dumb luck that we haven't nuked ourselves or provoked a, an exchange between, between Russia and the United States based on just bad information, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       Um, so, but so what is worrisome here is that it's hard to spend more than five minutes worrying about that on any given day. You know, like, well, I can worry, I can worry a lot about totally trivial things in my own life, right? Like, if, if my website goes down, you know, the field, my feeling of, of kind of moral emergency is at 11 right? I like what the fuck is happening. My website is down. Like I, I, you know, I want to call the, the, the, the, my website developers and it's an emergency. It's like, and yet when talking about when, when I hear that the, the people who, who make it, their business to think about the prospect, that whole cities may be annihilated by the biggest bombs in our lifetime. When I hear that they are more worried than they have ever been, I can, you know, five minutes after we talk about this, I'm not going to be thinking about it. Right. And that worries me is hard to, it's hard to have an appropriate emotional response to what we think the data show. And so it is with the suffering of other people, you know, you feel it about the homeless person. You can see on this sidewalk that you happened to be walking on. But to hear that 90,000 people in Los Angeles County are homeless, it's, it's, it's, it's inconceivable. And it's hard to summon an inappropriate emotional response.

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       Yes. That is perhaps some, we've been bull out of alignment with what we're capable of receiving, what we're can capable of transmitting. It's talking of sort of anthropology, I suppose the bats, human beings have been so extracted from these conditions that are, you know, where you said we wouldn't even recognize what disease was. We've, we've, we have become as gods, we have a cheer, some mounted, so many obstacles that perhaps we have no, we are no longer living within a pallet that is appropriate for this particular mammal.

Speaker 3:          01:54:16       But we also just have bugs in our hardware and software that we are bad at correcting for [inaudible] and that, and that's why, that's why again, systemic corrections, you like good laws and good tax codes and good governments and good institutions I think will do much heavier lifting for us. Then all of us getting our heads straight and keeping them straight day after day. So I made the example that I'll give here is based on the work of Paul Slovic, um, who found it. It's just, it's a propensity for moral error that is totally shocking. So if you tell people, uh, you give them like the classics are to Unicef Pitch, like here's you know, one little girl in Sudan, you know, her name is, is Jenny. Uh, she, you know, her parents were killed. She needs your help. $5 a day will keep her in school and all the rest, right?

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       You tell that story with one identifiable child peep, you get the maximum response of compassion and, and F and actual altruism from people. You ask them how much they'll give every month and you get their maximum number. If you show that same girl to a different group of people along with her brother and you say, here's Jenny and here's Jacob. They've suffered this horrible atrocity. $5 a day, we'll go $5 a month, we'll, we'll keep them in school, et Cetera. The, the, the altruism and the, and the self assessment of compassion reliably goes down just more to the scope of the problem, right? And it's the same girl in the same boy, you add 10, it goes down further. It goes through the floor and if you add background, background statistics, if you say this little girl Jenny, she's got this terrible problem, you can help and there's a hundred thousand girls just like her in Sudan alone, people just

Speaker 1:          01:56:02       passion, just wash it. That kind of apathy is a kind of despair and you kind of hope there's just no, there's no

Speaker 3:          01:56:07       point in doing anything.

Speaker 1:          01:56:09       And so that's what we have to correct for that. Teleology of civilization then seemed somewhat broken. The idea that sort of like the, the grow bigger and bigger states and as sort of a, a sort of a globally mandated government, these would seem to be poor ideas like what may work for human beings for the 7 billion is de centralization and to achieve that, to achieve real change, where do you suppose the fulcrum will need to be applied? Who are the people for whom? The 90,000 homeless and Little Jenny and the hundred thousand others. Oh, not really a problem because their system is operating precisely as it was intended to operate.

Speaker 3:          01:56:47       Well, it's all of us here again, there are not that many bad people. It's, we have, we have a default level of selfishness in virtually everyone all the time. And that we have to figure out how to game that and channel that successfully toward more benign ends. I mean, you, you what you want the perfect system, and this is what capitalism promises but doesn't deliver, is everyone selfishly seeking happiness for, for themselves and prioritizing the happiness of their families, their loved ones, and then maybe going out a few and maybe extending that circle more and more as they learn more and more about the other problems in the world. Yes. But they'll never, they'll never extend that circle perfectly or they'll, or most people certainly won't. And what you want is a system that captures all of that energy in a way that allows all boats or most boats to rise with the same tide most of the time.

Speaker 3:          01:57:52       And, uh, is there, is there a perfect solution to all of these zero sum and, and, and positive some arrangements. Um, I don't know, but there's certainly better and worse ones. And we know, we know that. We know there's some bad ones on offer that we don't want to experiment with again and we want to refine our, our current set of solutions so that life gets better and better for [inaudible]. The truth is, it's, this can sound like a very despairing conversation, but life has gotten better and better for virtually everyone in our lifetime. I mean if you look at the last century, I mean it's something like 10% of people now live in extreme poverty and 90% of people don't. We've got 7 billion people, 90% of them are not in what we're calling extreme poverty. The something like 150 years ago that was flipped, it was 90 10 the other way. It was only, it was 90% in extreme poverty. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       I suppose again, they send the metric by which we judge poverty and the metric by which we judge human experience is something that could be long debated. And for me, I suppose what I'm interested in and I the here I think we can cut his truth, truthful experience io at listen to a podcast you did once and like a with someone else. I respect very much Jordan piece and it got caught up along while on some sort of semantic tangle and like so but what I feel is that, you know, I am interested in my own sweet, selfish, egotistical way in conveying and transmit in love and change. And I think that the point where I feel pressure needs to be applied if that's even the right attitude, you need it be combative. Uh, for me there's sort of the focus, I think individual personal revolution and personal salvation and I think he's a, an important component and the introduction of ideas that go beyond rationalism and materialism may be a necessary spur for significant change. I feel like rationalism, materialism, lead people to believe, well we are just individuals. We're here for a short amount of time, pleasure sensation. It seems to me that just looking around that seems to be what is happening. It seems to disengage people. And then some of the examples you've given about your human compassion, it seemed, it, it's very, it seems very hard for people to access love to access community and within the operating system that currently have bites.

Speaker 3:          02:00:24       I would agree. Yeah. We need more again, what you're talking about our systems and institutions that, you know, just how good could a school be, right? How good could entertainment be? How good could, uh, the Internet be? How good could smell, how good could social media be in terms of leading us where we want to go, both, both personally and interpersonally. And I think we are at the beginning of,

Speaker 4:          02:00:55       uh,

Speaker 3:          02:00:58       perfecting those things. And it's not, it's not that we'll reach perfection, but it, I mean, all of these things are obviously so broken as they are now that we just don't know how much better life would be if we got halfway to, to the optimum. Um, it's just, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:01:19       uh,

Speaker 3:          02:01:21       there's an immense amount of work to do and the work will be done on the basis of having insights into truth and having a fact based discussion about the consequences of, of, uh, turning any of these knobs.

Speaker 1:          02:01:37       Sam Harris in the background about it, there's the gallery to this small facility that headspace the brilliant app in spite of the contradictions of having existed in a consumer's technological world, which I would like to give props theme was against the wall and that one, I mean, but you know, we're, we're going, there ain't no wall to sort of send me quote doc Brown in the transcendent realm, the wall, the me, the you, all one or glorious oneness. People have been holding up like ice skating goes like 45 minutes, 60 minutes for 120 minutes now, just that duration of the podcast right now for me, it's been a great joy and a great pleasure and a rigorous intellectual workouts. And I speak with you and I'm enjoying it very much. Sam Harrison most grateful. And I've returned to the idea that conversations are what's likely to produce change, particularly conversations between people that don't automatically agree on the most significant issue.

Speaker 1:          02:02:32       So I'm incredibly grateful to you. Likewise. Well, thank you. Thanks, man. Yeah, I got you Sam Harrison, science and everything.
