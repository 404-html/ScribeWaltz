Speaker 1:          00:00          If you are not part of the elite, the elite, then whether you are being exploited or whether you are irrelevant, I don't like those options. I would. I would like to even increase smile, but still there is a big difference between exploitation and irrelevance. When you're exploited, you're still powerful. You are powerful as long as it to be exploited. Parents in your rotation, they need you. I mean if you're exploited, for example, you can go on strike and they care about it because they need you. They need you to work in the factory, have to serve in the army. When you're irrelevant, you are much less powerful, irrelevant. People can't go on strike. I mean if they go on strike, who cares? Now you can't go on strike, but you do need to organize now this and this narrative that the glorification, the narrative where the worker is central because their worker is necessary.

Speaker 1:          00:54          This narrative is constructed out of politeness but mainly in order to exploit the worker and whilst you may have a personal sense of engagement of, Hey, I'm like that guy with a sheaf of wheat ain't live grand. You still are simply a resource now, but again, you are an important resource and have purpose. You saying on a spiritual level? No, no, no. I mean from the point of view of the of the political and economic system, you are important and the fact is they do invest in you. Even if you live in a place like Nazi Germany, as long as you're not a Jew or something like that, Hitler would invest in your health, in your education, would build sewage systems in, in the slums because Hitler needs you eventually to work in the factory and to serve as a soldier in the Wehrmacht. Otherwise, Germany wants to be strong, so even within fascism, aside from the obvious things about fascism that that needs to be rehashed because they sound sort of evidently a bomb.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Annabelle, the positive thing about fascism, the ID, the idea about us human beings functioning as a unit, that is not a lie. It's not an exploitation that's not exploitative in, in the same way as a capitalist system exploits people by selling the deception. Oh, you know, why don't we work? It would be good when really it's entirely. Your labor is a resource for us in fascism. Isn't there a sense that there is an earnest belief that the included group are valuable? It's not insincere and you're not being duped or product. Hitler wasn't going those stupid blonde blue eyes. He means he means it. It's sincere. Oh, that's a big question. I mean, it's, when you look at the fact is it's really a myth, but certainly there is a domain, the sincerity of fascism or the sincerity of fascism, of really caring about the individual German housewife and her children are just a means to mobilize population to suit the needs of the powerful in the end.

Speaker 1:          03:02          I mean, you see it in fascism like in, in, in many other regimes. And um, and of course there are always the excluded excluded ones. Fascism in order to function. Fascism always needs enemies. And traitors. My list of potential ideas, again, there is a lot of misunderstanding about fascism, which is I think one of the reasons you see a real resurgence of certain fascist tendencies to danger for. One of the misunderstandings is that there's a kind of romanticism for the inclusive group and if you have enough, this is just the opposite, that I think that when we tried to and after the Second World War we were, it was a central theme in every education system in the west, uh, to warn people about fascism. But I think we, we didn't do a good enough job because we presented fascism as a kind of monster and we vilified.

Speaker 1:          03:58          I mean, we didn't explain what was attractive about it. And what was attractive about fascism is that he told people, you are, if you belong to the group, to the right group, you are the most important thing in the world. You are the most beautiful thing in the world. When people looked in the Fascist Mirror in the 19 thirties, if a German in and looked in the mirror, he did not see a monster. He sold the most beautiful thing in the world. This is why it was so attractive comparable to the worker in the wheat sheaf propaganda poster. You have an identity that is meaningful to your culture. Your individual identity has value in the collective identity, whether that's your area and looking in the mirror or your a communist, toiling in the field or factory. You have purpose. You have meaning. They seems to be a resource that's important when organizing society or system.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Yeah, and and you know, it, it, it, it, it, it flatters people and people like to hear that sort of a human resource, isn't it? I mean when we're looking at. It's difficult, isn't it, when talking about extremist ideologies such as fascism and communism as we've experienced it because as you just said, we extract, we extract from. We don't include what must be attractive about it and there is nothing wrong with people feeling purpose or valued in the collective. There is something wrong with people persecute in an but. But, but because we made this, we wanted to warn people about fascism. We did it. We didn't really explain what was tempting about it. Why do people go after it? It's a bit like, you know when, when I read Harry Potter, when I watched star wars or things like that, they always make the same mistake that they depict the bed guys is just terrible and ugly and repulsive and then are left with the sense, why would anybody follow voldemort?

Speaker 1:          05:51          Why would anybody follow Darth vader? These guys, they are ugly. They are mean even to their own. There are mean and cruel and then you don't understand what is seductive about the dark side and the thing is the dark side is very seductive because for the people in it, it's very beautiful. Again, you look in the mirror, you see the most beautiful thing in the world. This is something that you know, traditional Christian art understood much better than modern science fiction. You mean that the devil would be beautiful. The devil is beautiful. This is. Otherwise, who would it be tempted. So now we have an intelligent oration that grew up with the idea of fascism is the ugliest thing in the world. And then when, when they start to adopt fascist ideas and they look in the mirror, what the CS, not a monster, what they see is something very beautiful.

Speaker 1:          06:43          And then they reached the conclusion we can't be fascist. Yes, yes, I understand. When you want people to be vegetarian, it can't. You can't say bacon tasted awful. You have to go look. Bacon's great where we just can't eat it. You okay? And the same with drugs. Look heroin, a lot of fun, but I'm sorry we can't take care of in anymore. It's off the agenda and what? Those things are resourced by. His pleasure, pleasure, power. These energies are attractive or these ideologies, they move through our consciousness. No, they all have at some point interacted with human consciousness. They are an expression of our consciousness. They seem to be universal's. There seem to be perennial themes that are emerging. We want to belong to the collective. We want to feel valued. We want to feel purposeful, antithetical. In fact, the dystopia that you're describing where a useful class will vein flight and to an unmanageable degree, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          07:35          Then when we're looking at the systems that have failed and the systems they're succeeding and what we have learned and what we're beginning to understand, it isn't our obligation to begin to present alternative ideas that somehow embrace these ideas of purpose, a essence and where possible throw off the imaginary shackles of the systems, preexisting requirements I eat. Your value is as a worker. Every single one of us in this room right now is here because of our value as a worker. You May, Jenny, every single person he is being paid to be here, right one way or another. And like, you know, well you love your husband got your husband's in the room, but you've already made these come up all the best buy beers. So like, you know, but like none of us or like the most important things in my life are not my values as a man doing a podcast. It, my children, my wife and all human beings know this, that, that love is something that can be realized through work but need not be. And often is it.
