Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Pankaj mishra is it a historian and novelist and is a recipient of Yao universities, Windham Campbell literature prize born in north India. His work has appeared in the New York Times time. The Guardian and the independent and his books include an end to suffering the Buddha in the world from the ruins of empire and he's latest age of anger, a history of the present, which explains how the wider embrace of mass politics, technology and the pursuit of wealth and individualism has cost billions of drift and the demoralized world. Welcome to the show Pankaj. Thank you for kindness. Thanks for having me. What I know of your work suggests to me that you are addressing themes that have interest did us on under the skin and driven us w w w but on a huge scale. You're trying to address there the essence of what we've been trying to tackle on a global scale.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Your latest book, age of anger. You're talking about rage that that this is a sort of, this is a time that is determined by rate. Are you saying that this is, this is cross culturally regardless of where you are in this particular economic story? Like whether it's like the claps of empire that you know, and nostalgia that's been experienced in this country or the United States where rage is, feels like a very present emotion, rage and despair on recent visits to America. I sort of felt enough the few public spaces that I was in a sense a sense of a society ill at ease with itself. So like, and I've experienced it in these two western nations, but you're saying in India is this also a uh, a modern cultural, the at the center of rage?

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Well, the, the experience of disaffection or rage is at this moment truly global, truly common amongst you know, nations regardless of where they are in the, so called, you know, uh, this, this, this particular tragic tree of, of economic growth. So in the advanced countries as well as the developed world, the developing countries and so on, so forth. And I think it's because in, in a, in a context like the United States, which has enjoyed a great deal of power for a long time, a lot of people feel that, uh, the future and this is an unprecedented shift would be considerably worse then what they have been accustomed to, what the parents and grandparents that they are not really passing on. You know, it was to the children or the grandchildren in wish they can actually hope to flourish.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       And this is important package because progressivism is the defining attribute, the essence of the story. So once progression stops, once the next generation of things, hang on a minute, things are getting worse. We're not going to own our houses, we're not going to have jobs. We were already mired in debt. The whole thrust of our national identities is undermined,

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       is the crux of the crisis. Uh, you know, progress was, the substitute was a replacement for God. This notion of continuous improvement that was truly radical when we killed off God, when we moved away from traditional religion be devices, new belief system, that there will be continuous progress. And we have revised our existence on this fact, so I mean we must not underestimate the radical shifts we are undergoing right now.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       So I suppose if you were living in a culture that is experiencing continued economic growth and progression or at least a significant portion of the population are experiencing it enough to maintain the momentum, then there is no need for God particularly that it when the idea of God is often eh demonstrated through ancestor worship, we are like our ancestors. We live like them, that we are connected to this origin myth, this origin story, and through these rituals we connect to them. This is our relationship with God. We are part of the whole, when you see continual progression, when you've seen an advancement of mankind and obviously the shifts philosophically that occurred a couple of hundred years ago that you mentioned at the beginning of this conversation, it's very easy to see us as separate from God, God as the idea of originator creator progenator.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Absolutely. It's a, it's a radical idea in or some, someone warned about this, that progress is the false gold. The chip when he said that God is dead and we haven't faced up to the consequences. This is what he was talking about, that we've given our belief in a transcendental authority. We've given up believe in this God who lays down laws, who orders our societies. We have decided to go do it all by ourselves and we have invested our faith in progress. But this is a false religion. And I think in many ways this moment of Neil is in that pc today, globally is this realization that this religion is faltering, that there are not enough believers in the religion of progress. This is the biggest shift. This is what I'm really talking about in my book. And that is what I mean, that we need to have a broader framework to understand what is going on today. I mean, there are obviously many aspect of this, um, the economic inequality and of obviously a lot of the rage is fuel by people thinking that the promises happy and unrealized, they've been fulfill. They've been cheated, they've been deceived. But it's also because they have been promised a great deal, especially in the last three decades of globalization.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Did you ever believe when the, um, sort of the, the research an ethno nationalism fails to deliver and I suppose there is a version of ethno nationalism or least sort of a re a religiously led ethno nationalism in India also when I suppose when these modalities foul or deliver, there will be further disappointment and further rate. Or just to ask you a sort of a personal question, presuming a, if you grew up in a village in India, I'm guessing your religious town. So you had a religious talk about bringing to you believe in God and what kind of religion were you raised in?

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       Personally? I mean I, I think of myself as someone who's been iridium irredeemably be secularized in the sense that I cannot be religious in the way my parents are religious, religious in the sense of thinking that everything that happens in the world is due to God is because there is a hidden invisible force behind all of it. And, and then everything that happens can be explained with reference to this figure. Now that is, it will be that I now can no longer enter. But when you begin, when you, when you are in proximity to it, you do realize that the big shift really. Um, and, and you see that happening right now, that shift happened here a long time ago. In places like India, you can still see it happening. Is this shift from belief in transcendental authority to this belief in progress, in material improvement?

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Isn't that just a different form of transcendent or authority?

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Well, that was, that was the mistake. A lot of people in the 19th century were pointing to Dostoevsky or nature that once you bring down the Kingdom of God onto earth, you will have trouble. Once you start thinking that what is promised to you in the afterlife can be recreated on earth. When you start thinking in those terms, then you've set yourself up for cruel disappointment.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Yes. Also, it seems that we've become quite muddled in our interpretation of myth. It seems to me, even when I hear the phrase after life, uh, how the resonance of that for me personally is now when my material, human life as Russell, the individual where my ego life ceases to be the dominant driving principle for my existence, I will experience inadvertent Commerce, Heaven, paradise freed from the ego. So that, you know, when, when I see sort of perennial messages between Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and believe me, I know very little about all three of those theologies, just enough to know that there seems to be an idea of essence and even the more folkish and uh, I'm assuming less academic understanding that one imagines that your parents may have had, I don't know, your, that could have been a professor of theology. I don't know if, I'm guessing when people talk about religion and sort of quite folkish terms of a transcendent or fora a got this basically governing everything I can sorta eve like even with my limited understanding of the mechanics of the material world, I can see a use for that as a, as an analogy, I can see a use for the idea of supreme or transcendent, hopefully benevolent or authority.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Well, you know, I mean it has become hugely fashionable to mock religion or people who are religious as essentially superstitious, ignorant, barbaric. But we forget that religion is a huge source of constellation. It helps people accommodate, um, helps people to accommodate themselves to grief, to loss, to disappointment and disappointment is the fate for most people.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       Yes. And in fact possibly all people. I mean cause sometimes when it's presented in terms of a consolation, like that's sort of sort of common new atheist argument, oh it's for Sakos to, for constantly, but I sort of feel like you are going to die. The material world isn't going to make you happy. Your primal drives are going to be insufficient in making you satisfied. Your Ego is going to let you down, everything's going to fail you, so you're going to need constellation. And so on that side as well as constellation eight becomes a kind of creed, it becomes a kind of purpose. It becomes a kind of meaning. And I don't think a fabricated one either. I think a necessary ultimate, a central one. Whilst I recognize that most religions have cultural accouterments of their time that are unhelpful, prejudicial, you know, like those are the things that I try personally to look beyond to this sort of powerful truths beneath them. Now, uh, again, Pankaj very the beginning of our conversation, you'll have, you said you're very interested in the important shift in the last couple hundred years, philosophically, and we mentioned colonialism and industrialization as two components. Is that, I'm interested in the philosophical component. I know you're talk about voltaire and Russo. Uh, the philosophers were a little earlier than that, but tell us what their significance is.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       No, I use these figures to highlight certain contradictions in the modern project which were apparent before and modern societies came into being, you know, in the late 18th century, put it very, very broadly. People, uh, in the late 18th century we're faced with this large question that okay we are moving away from societies, from a world in which the church was important in which belief in God was important. [inaudible] the monarchy was all powerful. We are moving towards societies where people are going to devise a social contract for themselves, uh, where people are going to use individual reason, where people are going to use the new insights of science to master nature. So these were the big debates happening during the late 18th century. You know, what we now call the moment that we now call the enlightenment, the two major figures of this, uh, of this enlightened where voltaire and Russo and the debate, the conflict between them emerges because full there is offering a model and a blueprint for society that we are more or less living in today, which is a society driven by self interest, by the entrepreneurial spirits, by self interested individuals competing with each other, using the ideas of science to advance, to expand, to expand their powers.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       And Rousseau who comes from very different backgrounds, social backgrounds also. What was the difference? Well, he, he, he, he's known poverty. He's known deprivation, um, in, in, in his, in his early years. We're on the side even forever. It's on a path and I see all our mufflers, film, streaks, yard, why he knife fights. So he comes to, he comes to Paris and find themselves alienated by this new world of these philosophers talk to each other who were very interested in forming alliances with powerful people, including, you know, some of the most powerful monarchs of the day because they think the monarchs are the right people, you know, sort of early version of the new concept today who sidle up to presidents and prime ministers and offer them advice. And you know, here's what you should do in order to modernize your society. So this kind of rhetoric, uh, Russo is completely against and he's talking about human needs, the needs of the human soul.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       And, and, and he thinks that the society premised on self interest on vanity, on imitation, on people trying to keep up with the Joneses, trying to imitate the rich, the wealthy, the famous is a recipe for all kinds of disorders. To use a word we, we, uh, brought up earlier, all kinds of psychological disorders. And he said he's a sort of acute psychologist of the human soul, partly because he himself is suffering from all kinds of problems. Envy being one of them. [inaudible] Santino he was at Maine. Well, it's a sort of compound of emotions, envy, a sense of humiliation, feeling of powerlessness and it's sort of large restlessness. You think it might mean a lot of it, a lot of that. And in fact, what I try and argue in the book that we are sort of looking at a global epidemic of reason. Timo, where large numbers of people feel this emotion importantly for the most part. And when the moment comes as it came during brexit and during, during the trump election, it erupts volcanically. So Russo in many ways is anticipating the pressures, the intolerable strain this new society promotes around self interest and vanity is going to put on the human soul.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       All right? He sort of prophesies is in a sense that this will lead us to this crisis. It will lead us to a spiritual crisis. Russo also, he talks about like the noble savage. Is that right? Is that right? The idea that innately we are connected to that there is a, in simple, uh, prehistoric or traditional cultures, there is a beauty. There is a grace that human

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       [inaudible]. You know what's, what's actually interesting, uh, what is in fact I'm creating this particular image in Rousseau's. Mine are the discoveries European travelers are making in the new world when they're encountering indigenous peoples in these places. They're bringing back reports of how these societies work. So the whole idea of people living in nature. This is a sort of particular construction that Rousseau, someone like Rousseau absorb many among many other people and and uses that to critique this new society that is coming into being, you know, compassion for instance, is hugely important to Rousseau. He thinks the innate revulsion we feel at the sight of someone else's suffering. That should be the basis of the social contract,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       right? That tried to use that as a feel. It's interesting that you talk about these essential bases that political movements and political moments are somehow ultimately underwritten by inner phenomena or inner frequencies. That Rousseau argues that compassion should be the basis for our social contracts. And what we're experiencing now, you argue in your book is rage as the determinant that w or respond to more a feeling of worthlessness. And like this for me seems most familiar and like one of my frustrations is to see the way that brexit has subsequently been packaged by the sort of, certainly in terms of the media that dominant, uh, writers of our story that the dominant cultural commentators, oh, what brexit means is racism. The ordinary people are racist. And I think that that that is the kind of reductive ism that led to brexit. I think. I think that what actually has happened is a breakdown between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie that the bourgeoisie and no longer interested in representing the interest of ordinary working people, ordinary working people have began to recognize that and while certainly concerned about migration and racism, how could they not be part of a narrative given how much those ideas are propagated through mainstream media?

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       Like I think it's more important than that. I think the shift is between a middle class intelligentsia sort of abandoned, ordinary working people to form a new alliance with the powerful and to demonstrate their radicalism merely through superficial allegiances with identity politics, identity politics as like, oh no, well we're very good on gender rights were very good and the quality in our race without consequence, you know, no longer addressing the key issue of all societies. How do we control the powerful, how do we confront the powerful, how do we bring about equality, fairness as a society based on the compassion that you said that Russo's

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       I feel it's a huge mistake to judge people who vote for trump or who voted for brexit as racists. It's counterproductive apart from anything else. It's wrong. It's, it's, it's totally wrong. A lot of people who voted for trump also voted for Obama the biggest hoax of our times. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       so what a Bama is the biggest hoax finding. So I think so. It's interesting because we've had an academic in here a little while ago. I, Hindi Andrews is professor of sociology and Black Studies at Birmingham University who said that trump is a more authentic or better president for black America than a Bama because it no longer conceals submerged inequalities and ongoing racism was the embodiment of new liberal chic

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       and managed to conceal as your other guests said, a whole range of grotesque inequalities through this very seductive personal style he had, you know, we getting on a different subject altogether, but I think in many ways Obama and eight years of Obama, right? Enabled someone like Donald Trump and if you don't see this connection, if we insist on thinking of Donald Trump as someone who just arrived in the United States from somewhere in Mars,

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       we are going to miss this. Yeah. Is your age in a desperate attempt to continue the neo liberal narrative? Trump is presented as some kind of grotesque anomaly, a product of racism when he is precisely a product of neo liberalism is precisely the end point. Like, how can people, how does society not have fest are festering sense of separation and eh and fear of otherness when we've just experienced 2030 years have been pumped up like anti-islamic sentiment sort of like pre nine 11 at these stories have been going on for a long, long while and he said, it feels to me that this moment is simply some someone's just drew like ridden that wave a wave that sort of being created by cyclonic racism and ongoing

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       prejudice. I think, I mean, you know, trump is the image that we don't really want to confront of us in the mirror and it's because we keep thinking of this other era of which most of us people who write in, in, in you work for the mainstream media, I include myself are beneficiaries, have been beneficiaries of the system, our lives, our material lives have improved enormously in the last 2030 years. So we have enormous investments in keeping this particular narrative going. And one way of doing it is to say that these people who bought for trump are deplorables, are racists, and that there is something like true liberalism out there. If only people would listen. If only people could understand what is good for them. Instead they follow the racist thing stinks and vote for trump. This is a deliberate misdiagnosis. Uh, this is, this is a real distortion of what has been happening, not just in the United States elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       Okay. The fact, you know, going back to, so the promise of freedom with which the modern world begins. Freedom from authority, freedom from custom, the fact that for many people this has become hugely, hugely impossible to realize because of the nature of our institutions, the increasing centralization of power, the fact that most people find themselves reduced to cogs in a, in a, in a boss machine, most people find very little stability, very little dignity in their working lives. All this has led to this moment that we are experiencing today. You know, this, this, you know, on one hand this extravagant promise of freedom, prosperity, and then the fact of structural inequality. The fact that mobility is blocked for most people unless he belonged to the right family, unless you belong to the right dynasty, unless you belong, unless you go to the right college. And you know, this is not something that I'm saying or a few people are saying. This is now been demonstrated empirically with all kinds of data. Um, the fact that college educated people have a huge advantage over everyone else. That morbidity has been blocked for large numbers of people. So we are looking at a massive dysfunction in which all the founding promises of the modern world look almost impossible to fulfill

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       if feels like the conditions are correct for genuine radicalism, for real radical change. It seems that there's potential for explosive global change. Where do you think that it's, I mean it's a big question. Do you think those societies to sectarian two fractured cause? I like it because I'm a public performer. I am often [inaudible] and I work in a, mostly in this country at the moment I like, I'm often in regional spaces of with 1500 or a couple of thousand people doing stand up comedy. And one of the things I talk about is how the powerful continually invite ordinary working people to I want to enough, uh, suspiciously when I as a veil for the actions of the powerful. So like I sort of watch people's faces as I say, you know, you will always do what you've always done. Blame other people that are basically the same as you that don't have power for things that only powerful people can affect or change.

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       So, and then in the show I say, fuck Muslims, fuck with disabled. Fuck the white working class, middle class. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck can you thanks for your vote. See you in four years. And I see that this divides the room. I see that people are uncomfortable in letting go of more immediate sense of it is the problem I feel sometimes with the mind is there are certain stories that are easier to believe. There is stories that are more visceral that relate more to our experience of being human. It's hard to, concealed power is very difficult to understand. By its very nature,

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       it's, I mean, you know, the other factor is that in the West and western Europe and the United States, we haven't had mass movements for change for a very long time. You know, if you think about it, the last time we had mass movements, large numbers of people participating in them against the war for civil rights, feminist movement, this, these all happened in the 1960s and seventies. So whole memory of popular participation in politics of large numbers of people coming together for a particular cause of justice, bonding together, feeling degree of solidarity. That memory has been x, you know, completely expunged

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       possibly because of the success of the philosophy that you said Voltaire was exemplary of that. We do regard ourselves as individuals now that liberalism that it means freedom to be an individual and freedom to meet be an individual means freedom to be disconnected and an inability to see your identity is integral to the, to the roles, relationships and destinies of people that are basically just the same as if we live in, in an interdependent society. Yes. That we live in an interdependent

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       world. Um, you know, this is something the Buddhist started talking about 2,500 years ago. I wrote a book about the put that where this team feature is a great deal. The team of interdependence, which the would that invoke in order to critique the rising notion of individualism at the time. I mean this, this, this notion of the individual self that has to express fine, that has to consolidate itself with all kinds of material advances and, and, and, and, and guide of intellectual growth, which is what has become so dominant, especially in the last three decades. A kind of hyper individualism, which is unconstrained by any institution, you know. Mm. That is what has been propagated and also swallowed whole by large numbers of people, which has really frayed, so many social sorted out at ds, which is again, sort of really destroyed I imagination in some crucial ways. You know, whole ways of acting in the world upon the world has been lost to us because of this obsession with individualism.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       We mentioned and I've, uh, somewhat frame this conversation within the idea that there is an imposition of progressivism on, uh, but on former colonized nations by former colonial nations, enough, uh, competing at low, less powerful, but I think still interesting story is the raw and, and perhaps a component of Orient, Orient Elysium is the romanticization that also comes from sort of I suppose. So they like, cause for me, meeting you as an Indian man that grew up in a small town and me as a person who's a, and my body is smothered in tattoos from your great scriptures of figures and icons and gods from your scriptures. And cause I write literal text. Yeah, yeah. Love smothered in Bloody Sanskrit, Krishna's here connect. She's here, the Shakras are there. Oh, I was smothered in all this stuff. So there's this sort of like this sort of, the other component of orientalism is a software Western fetishization of a and possibly a reductively of, uh, of Hindu ideology or vedic knowledge. And so no, but do you think that there is a genuine value that can be useful in a sort of postmodern?

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       Far Too much easy mockery and criticism of people who look to all the cultures or, or ancient philosophies, whether in Asia or elsewhere in Africa or, or Latin America or the Americas. Because what they are looking for is an alternative to a way of being, to a civilization that feels too much like a trap to them. And I think, you know, people in the 60s or went out to places like India and joined various countercultural moments, most famously the Beatles. And I know there was so many, they were literally hundreds of thousands of people who went out there looking for an alternative to this. So less mechanical society that they were living in, which was at that time in the 1960s engaged in a catastrophic violent war in Vietnam and indies elsewhere. So there was a lot of disillusionment back then, which made people look for some kind of a spiritual and moral possibility elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:29:49       And I think that impulse is important, that impulse, which can mislead. And he did mislead a lot of people, uh, into joining all kinds of crazy sex, um, being cornered by various gurus who were just waiting for these gullible people to show up. But I think it's really important to understand why these people went out there and that it's also important to understand that there is a lot of value. There is, there are many things of value in these traditions. These are these, this is, this is how human beings lived for centuries and centuries. We would be foolish to discard the wisdom contained in those traditions and philosophies.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       How do we utilize it, do you imagine? Because, uh, of course this is wisdom premised on a very different time on different conditions, but I sense that morally and spiritually there's a value in it. Can it like in defiance of the essence of secularism, do these spiritual models have information that ought be utilized in the establishment of new social systems? In your opinion?

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       You know, someone like the Dalai Lama, who, who I rate very highly, who is a Buddhist, but when he goes around the world, he insists that he's not really talking about Buddhism. He's talking about compassion, the importance of compassion. So He's coming from an ancient religious tradition. He's completely immersed in it. He's using that language, but he's not saying that you have to become a Buddhist. You have to convert to my way of life. He's saying these are some of the principles outlined, embraced by human beings a long time ago and since then followed by hundreds of millions of people and they have been hugely, hugely important and making possible contented lives. So you have to think about this as an alternative to these stress stouts, intolerable lives that you're leading out there, which is causing all kinds of psychological disorders. So I think you know, when you start thinking about it in these pragmatic ways, when you shed this baggage of religious tradition or spiritual tradition, when again, you think about the basic building blocks of human society, compassion and solidarity, those resources you can find in many different religious traditions including those in the west.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       I think it's really important too to realize it. Western Europe, the United States, is it cell full of those vital traditions. When you talk about the basic building

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       blocks of human society or so of course talking about the basic building blocks of a human being and a the, if these energies, these Schumer's these components of a human being include compassion, kindness, community, togetherness, Union Union and yearning, at least for the, for the last few things I mentioned, then these are, uh, perhaps I favorable resource to under route raw underwrite our social systems compared to these sort of individualism that has become rampant and is leading into deterioration is something I've brought up several times in this podcast. I'd like to know what you think about it in the moment prior to Indian independence from Britain, Gandy said that there's no point in us replacing the British merely to emulate them and to maintain their systems. I'm sure you're aware. And as it was, he said he spoke sort of that 60 70 years ago whenever it was said like that, you know that this is a country of 70,000 villages.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       All of them should be the PA perhaps into dependent but autonomous and free and, and he set that sort of like that, you know, so it was talked in a way about sort of a decentralized social system. And he also talks about, and I've not mentioned this is march something, but he said people will have to to some degree let go of their need for commodification. There need to consume. And it seems sort of again, sort of a as ear really perspicacious to hear someone talk about, you can't be obsessed with your iphone for half a century prior to that, that kind of technology being available. But it seemed to me very pertinent. But there is that we have to let go. This a narrative of progressivism that keeps coming up is aligned to the liberal idea of individual freedom, which is aligned to consuming to make yourself happy and at some point where the rubber meets the road, individual human beings like me. And you said earlier, we are sort of prisoners of comfort, addicted to the privileges that the last 2030 years is afforded us. At some point does it, it boils down to us saying we've got just have less stuff and we've got to let go of it. It's not working for us. And that might be a component of building different kinds of societies.

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       Absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, socialism for a long time carried many of the impulses leftover from faded Christianity feeling of compassion, uh, charity justice. Okay. When social socialism ones realized in certain countries, again, because socialism became all about material growth, material progress, these values were systematically disregarded. But I think it's really important to marry socialist ideas, primarily those of compassion, equality, justice to this regard for the environment. Nature recognition of kind. Gandhi had very early on in the 1920s and thirties. I mean, he was early figure of the green movement that the earth does not have enough resources to fulfill all the greedy desires we have for, uh, gadgets failed or amenities for life that we have to learn and practice. The virtue of renunciation is that that is a very, very important, uh, value for the society we live in. And again, this is not someone talking in a vacuum. This is someone, and this is an aspect of him that's elected. This is the one who has lived in three continents before the first world war. He's lived in Africa, he's lived in India, he's lived in Europe. This is the man with a wide experience of world that has been globalized during his time. Yes. He, he understands that this model, it's essentially it's premised on violence. Yes. He can see that because he's living under imperialism. He sees the,

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       violence is at the core of this whole process. And that is why India cannot afford to follow this path. And, and you know, he, he did say that we don't want to essentially, uh, replace rule by rule of the Englishman by English Raj. Yeah. So we need to think again about what kind of society we want for ourselves because following this model of and growth consumption oriented growth is going to lead us into an impasse.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       This concealed violence, uh, the, this, uh, the, the necessity of this model to conceal it's means and its motives is something addressed by Marxist theory. And it's, I suppose predicate it simply on the idea that you can't have limitless growth if you've got limited resources in the end, this will not even in the end sit clinically. This will lead to crisis. So capitalism at its heart needs to conceal both its means and its motives. Um, that at its core there is a kind of nihilism and like, well, we don't care which is going to carry on doing. It doesn't matter. I don't think about it. Sort of a sort of a weird psychopathic modus operandi. Um, it's interesting to me that you sort of spoke of a kind of an emergent sense of nihilism. And the despair that we experienced as a result of this nihilism because precisely because we are beginning to experience while continue while we're continue, while the lie is sort of still sort of propped up with a by quantitative easing or are compliant media new iphone upgrade. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean I take them whenever they're offered. No, I'm not the one I found 10 now. Yeah. The, these continues to be concealed. So,

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       uh, well what I'm asking I suppose

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       is La,

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       where will,

Speaker 1:          00:38:46       where do you, like you, you, you saying that it will lead to impasse, but it's perhaps likely that this rage will lead somewhere

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       darker. Do you, where do you envisage it? Well, you know, in many ways the solutions to many of the problems that exist today, political problems, economic problems, inequality, dysfunction, that pretty obvious if you're diagnosed the problem correctly, the problems, the, the, the prescriptions of the solutions would, would emerge naturally from that. The problem really is the, whether anyone or any party, any movement has the political will to do it. The establishment at present, whether in, in, in Europe or in America. I do not think it's capable of charting a new path of leading us out of this impasse. Marsha depends on social movements, on political movements, on the energy, intellectual dynamism, dynamism of young people who are entering public life for the first time with new ideas, with no prejudices, no fantasies about themselves, about their imperialist past and, and, and, and, and, and what their ancestors achieved in the second world war and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       And these are people that we should look to us. I mean, I feel like my generation was a, was a failure. Um, I'm in, I'm in now, um, uh, approaching my, my, uh, um, late forties, and I feel that my generation was too much in thrall to these notions of universal progress and growth that started to be globalized back off back in the late eighties, early nineties. And it's a generation that has not been intoxicated by this kind of thinking. Yes, that's very experienced, is different, is very, is very distinctly, is one, should never underestimate the power of a generation remake or young generation to remake the world. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:46       Curious the identity and fluidity, a PA to be sort of a determining component of the younger generation where they don't want to be labeled. They either around sexuality and identity. There is a sort of, there is a sort of a new fluidity that bodes well for transitioning and change on a social and political. I think it's fantastic. I mean, I think, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       all our rigid categories, um, masculine, feminine for instance. I mean we've been, we've been experiencing now for the last few months, this sort of explosion of, um, stories about this whole culture of oppression that has existed in the heart of the modern world. Again, something that used to be blamed exclusively on Islam or religion, the oppression of women, the exploitation of women. And now we see a, it, it, it, there's pathology existing in the citadel. Absolutely. Uh, within corporate cultures. You know, and I think what it is telling us that, uh, lot of this oppression is systemic. Yeah. These, it's premised on these rigid separations of, of you know, mescaline roles, feminine rules and this identity blurring and fluidity that we sue today is an attempt, whether it's deliberate or not, it's certainly a very admirable, is trying to transcend these categories that actually create oppressive conditions for, for many, many people.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       That's brilliant insight. Thank you very much. That means to ask you a few more sort of, uh, questions that relate to your work and sort of bring us to this pretty salient. The, we touched on the recent recent amount. Am I saying it correct? I really liked that. Um, what's, uh, like can you unpack the kick card aspect of that day to turn the kicker God used and how it relates to terrorism?

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       I think, you know, um, for Kierkegaard [inaudible] was something that emerges when individuals are made to think that they are equal. Okay. Why did the same time they confront the fact the brute fact structural inequality. So it's this collision between the feeling that you're equal, that you all have the same opportunities that you are in the same social level, and then you encounter the fact that some people are much better off, that there are structural injustices at work, historical injustices at work that make some people more privileged than others. He diagnosed this as a problem peculiar to modern society because societies in the past did not uphold the quality as an ideal or as a value. These are hierarchical societies. Okay. [inaudible] know they did not think about instituting equality as an idea. It's more than society that thinks of equality as a central idea, but at the same time, because of the process of industrialization, because of all these other things that start to happen in the 19th century and kick your God is writing in the 19th century, in the mid 19th century, he can see that there's a contradiction opening up between the promise of equality between the promise of freedom and the growth of institutions that deny people equality and freedom.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       And it's sin. That denial that the feeling of the [inaudible] germinates Oh, brilliant. So he identified a fundamental contradiction. Absolutely, absolutely. Sorry drew. So although he did not use the word resulting more, um, but he, he, he, he did point to some central contradictions in the modern project that what we are trying to achieve will not be achieved because there are some, there is something just intrinsically contradictory about pursuing equality in a society where competition, vanity, imitation, our values and ideas,

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       these values I find personally very punishing and I experienced all of them quite deeply. Vanity plays a big role in my life and has done and it's something I'm very aware of and I'm trying to diminish his role. Competition is a not good feeling to feel I'm not good enough. I have to be better than these people, these, these models. I expect that when I like, cause one of the reason I started doing this a podcast is because I go to the, so as university in London doing a degree in religion in global politics. Really? Yeah. And at the moment I'm doing a module of a sort of the, the roots of the traditions of yoga. So it's looking at a lot of vedic texts, your pan, upanishads, et cetera. And whenever I'm listening to the lectures or reason about it and I sort of have been doing this generally across the course, I feel like what does this matter to mean now?

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       What do these values mean to me right now in this room, in this world, on this planet, in these systems right now. And get it. Cause I can see the impact of vanity. I can see the failure of narcissism, I'm experiencing it. I'm experiencing the failure of consumerism. I'm seeing the way that I'm inhibited and limited by these ideas. A moment ago you said like if you correctly diagnose the problem, then the prescription becomes obvious, which is a pretty cool catch me actually. I reckon you should start pushing that. Uh, so, um, what, what do you diagnose as the problem and is it like with all of these complexities and on the scale that we now live with, which is, you know, glide, but globalization, whether you regard it as pejorative as it now generally is, or positives, it was just a 10, 15 years ago. How do, how does one come up with a central universal solutions too?

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       Well, the probably isn't a central university tuition. I mean I think uh, it's probably a mistake to look for central university, the solution right now because the problem you could say was in thinking that there is a universal model of progress. The fact that all of us wherever we are have to device ideas, solutions for our societies, the nectar too. Okay. Real experience of her circumstances off the actual physical, geographical, political, historical conditions that'd be inherit this can only mean forms of devolution. Decentralization. Yes. You know, it, it the, the implications of this diagnosis in, in, in, in many different realms. Um, so you know, politically we have to think more about decentralization. We have to think about people being empowered, people feeling that they are in control of their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       So what do you make of people like on the left that say that without some form of dominant state power there will the, the, the, the, the, the idea of anarchy is a pejorative or negative state emerges like that, you know, when I sort of say look cause for a while and some of these conversations I've got, it seems like the like are our requirements and our needs are so diverse. We need the power to be as close as possible to the people that are affected by that power. People should run their own workplaces, their own hospitals, their own schools, their own communities and power. She'll be devolved, decentralized wherever possible. And what the feedback I've had from sofa as suppose in know traditional leftist thinkers and some people that are very much respect and admire is that without some authority, some sort of state or far even without some kind of central power, these projects we'll foul. Can you send it?

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       I can understand that concern because you know, um, something that has been said over and over again in the last 20, 30 years of new liberalism is that the state needs to step back and let's essentially society be governed according to market principles. Yes. So there is very good reason to be suspicious of that argument which wants to roll back the role of government in protecting the weak and the vulnerable. Yes, yes. And giving ceding power to market forces and we know who benefits from, from uh, the free play of market forces. At the same time, I think a history has shown repeatedly that states when invested with too much power, toning into oppressive, impersonal bureaucracies, that is the experience of many communists states, eastern European states. And so we have to be careful. We have to strike a balance between a state that is responsive to it's citizens that doesn't a choir and a not Thomas' life that doesn't stop living for itself. So we have to, there has to be a role for the state. At the same time, citizens have to feel that the decisions they are taking, the people they are choosing as their representatives are responsive to them. Okay. That they are in a politically functional society. I think what we have today is a deeply dysfunctional political society. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Yes. Evidently. What do you think of like a new heroes of the left's, uh, Jeremy Corbyn, this country, Bernie Sanders that know if that's relevant anymore in America or would be in the next election cycle if that's already something that's over and done with, Eh, do you think that within the conditions, the democratic conditions as we currently find them, that they would be able to represent people's interest? This is recent. Like Jeremy Corbyn, Sam Morgan Stanley should be afraid, you know, like, do you, do you think that there is, to coin the author, use the name of the movement, the backs, Corbyn genuine momentum in that direction? Do you think that with within democracy as we have it in this country, the, that he would be empowered to take action in that direction?

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       You know, I think I'm more interested in, in the movements then. Then in actual personalities. I think it's remarkable that within a few months, eh, massive movements consisting largely of very young people politicize young people came together and became a huge presence in British politics. That to me is more important than you know, the, the, the play of individuals. I mean, you know, Jeremy Corban is a, is an important figure in that he was the one who crystallize a popular feeling, a feeling that was not being articulated by certainly not the press, not by a commentators. He managed to recognize that a lot of people in this country for ready for change, for new ways of thinking. Now whether he is politically successful or not, the important thing is that he's already created a movement is already affected. It dramatic shifts in how people think about

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       what should be done here. Yes. But part of my question, pancake is what within democracy, as we currently experience it as it exists now, would a political party led by Corbyn or someone of a similar sensibility be able to enact the will of the people? Or would there be too much bureaucratic and systemic resistance and eh, and it does the state with the have sufficient power to confront eg transnational corporations.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       You know, the odds are stacked against 'em anyone trying to affect any movement, any individual trying to affect radical change in this society especially, which is a very conservative society, uh, where all kinds of ancient powers are entrenched. Okay. Unlike most societies in Europe, which experience revolution experienced, um, some kind of national upheaval that's overturn the old order, introduce new elements, we have to recognize that Britain never really had a revolution. So Brandon, pretty unique. Think that's extremely, I mean, it's, it's singular. Russia had one, France has a American side one. What did you watch Germany's then the failure of the Second World War? Well, Joe Jones went through all kinds of traumas. You know, even even before the Second World War. So first one went very good. I mean they, they, they had to unify. They had to sort of create a nation state in the first place in, in the, in the 19th century.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       Britain is really unique and one reason British politics has been so different from everywhere else. What has remained conservative for such a long time and why, you know, a certain kind of English, upper class landowning aristocracy still exercises enormous influence here. This is unprecedented, really unprecedented. And in the entire world you can't think of any other country with that kind of institutional power invested in traditional elites. How fascinating. So I say we're in a unique society. This is why someone, you know, uh, venturing on a radical project of political economic transformation is up against it. I mean, there's no point in, in, in, you know, uh, being overly optimistic by the one has to recognize that there are formidable challenges. Head. Do you think that the role of religion may be as if not more important as politics as we understand it in any significant social change?

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       Well, if you're talking about Britain, you know, the role of religion has been declining so dramatically, so rapidly that one can't really think of it as a, as a sort of political factor really anymore. Religion remains a alive in other societies, but unfortunately once religion is mobilized as a political force, beny turns into ideology, then it moves away from what people are talking about earlier. This belief in a transcendental authority, which in many ways is a source of constellation, a source of peace. Uh, it, it, it pacifies many people, it makes them more kind and compassionate. But when religion is used as an ideology, as a way of mobilizing people, it is inevitably a recipe for conflict. Because then what people want to do is to say, well, this community or this particular group does not belong. Yes, that is isn't conflict and violence isn't conflict.

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       Certainly in violence regrettably and necessary component in radical change, probably not violence. You know, there are, there are instances of societies which have recovered from great violence and rebuild themselves through largely nonviolent means. There has been conflict. Inevitably there'll be conflict because the old guard is, is, is, is not going to let go of it's Baba. I mean, you know, power never really concedes anything unless you make stern demands on it. So there is inevitably going to be conflict. But violence, um, I think violence can unleash a cycle where we will, you know, continue to employ violent means to pursue your ends and inflict more on more damage on the social fabric of society. I mean, this is, you know, this has been the experience of many societies. Bishop hired violent revolutions and undermine themselves and took a long time for them to recover from that kind of prime of violence. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       Nonviolence as a method for protest for like, you know, when you're talking about sort of the old guard and the resistance of the old guard, you can see that there's these entrenched, and you said ancient powers in this country you referring to, but you know, can see sort of even modern or authority that refuses to yield. Uh, like that. One of the, you said like the last time there was a huge civil unrest or like are around identity politics around sort of an empowerment of you for at the Marne for change different ideas was the 60s and we saw by the nonviolence huge component of that I suppose between in a way, because it would probably because of the infusion of sort of different ae, eastern mystic or to Luther King and the influence on Martin Luther King of Gandy. Very direct and explicit and expressed. And uh, I know, and I suppose because it was being counter post with such obvious domestic violence in the United States against the African American population in violence on the young men and women that have incentive Vietnam to fight. So I suppose it seemed like an eh, evident and obvious. And it though, I wonder if, uh, I wonder if you can envisage mass movements towards decentralization. There's something sort of contradictory about it, but that people coming together achieving solidarity to demand the right to be autonomous, to demand the dismantling of centralized interest institutions that prevent people having real purchase, real power, real purpose.

Speaker 2:          00:58:55       You know, there are instances of, um, movements for decentralization, which turned into secessionist movements, sometimes inevitably such as, um, cartoon. Yeah. Um, people, a lot of people in Hong Kong for instance, they want the freedom to run their own affairs. Um, you will, you could argue that large numbers of people in Scotland want to be free of a country that is hurtling a disaster, but a disaster spot too. It's brexit. So right now we see more cessationists tendencies, you know, which are a kind of replacement for a movement.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       That means what, just sort of breaking away from existing nation state

Speaker 2:          00:59:42       structures and forming an independent sovereign nation state. Why it doesn't, it doesn't solve the problem of centralization

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       there. And why, like under those terms, couldn't brexit be regarded as quite a positive thing if we're talking about decentralization or do you see the European Union is largely benevolent in confront, in economics to be made from the left

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       for Brexit? Yes. I've always believed that, um, it was never made, nobody bothered to make it. Um, the fact that, um, Britain should exercise greater sovereignty and should not have decisions made by mobile global capital. You know, I think we have to understand the impulse behind these apparently kilometers phenomenal like brexit or trump, which is essentially people really do want to take back control. Yes. The people promising control to them happened to be at this point, demagogues core interested in expanding their own power and those of their cronies. Okay. This does not mean that the platform, that's the four tone, which was the idea of taking back control is not hugely attractive numbers of people who really do genuinely want to take back into who do want to be empowered, who do not want their lives to be determined by the impersonal, abstract forces of, of capital. They do want to be repulsed, decide their societies to be repleted decides that, uh, and, and, and, and wants economic imperatives or indeed the imperatives of profit, corporate profits to override human values, human considerations. But if it's, if, if the far right or the devil Gawks, if they are the only ones channeling this energy. Okay. Two was their own ends. Then we end up with these in these situations that we are in right now.

Speaker 1:          01:01:54       I really, I think that's a very optimistic analysis. By don't mean a romantic analysis, I think it's quite pragmatic and quite powerful. Uh, thank you. I appreciate that. But when you were saying that if you diagnosed the problem correctly, then the prescription becomes obvious and if indeed we are living in, let me quote you at the title, your book, age of anger, then compassion is necessarily the prescription compassion for one another. So I think that, you know, both for honest, from a spiritual perspective and from a practical political perspective, I think I've learned a great deal from this conversation and I can envisage, I really understood the story, their philosophical story or historical narrative in ways that I haven't before and it gave me cause for optimism and that, you know, I've never been a person that saw brexit is a wholly oh negative thing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       I, because of the background I come from, I have a different attitude towards that. Sort of the idea of what brexit might mean and what people might have meant when they said it. And that take back power, take back control as an impulse needn't necessarily be, uh, aimed at like, because we hate these group of people because we hate that group of people. Uh, thank you very much for explaining that to me. Thank you. It's been a wonderful conversation. I really enjoyed it. Yeah, me too man. Thanks Pankaj Mishra. Thank you very much for coming here.
