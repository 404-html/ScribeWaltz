Speaker 1:          00:00          So your perspective and your motivation is an optimistic one that you essentially believe that people that have extremist beliefs, however, those beliefs are resourced, whether it's a fundament fundamentalism from an Islamic perspective or ethno nationalism. Yeah. You think that these are almost temporary few bugs that human beings passed through, that they are not essential states as you said, that you are interested in in meeting the human being behind the, the, the, and you believe that human being is more truthful, more real, better than their group identity. And each of these cases

Speaker 2:          00:37          I do because what I've found in, in doing all the films that I've done at this point is the, the whatever the, the window do I always call it sort of window dressing or whatever the brand is that might be different, you know? So on the surface of it, it's going to look different to most people when it comes to a jihadi versus a neo Nazi. Well, these are completely opposing ideologies, completely different people and therefore should be treated completely differently. But what I found is that the type of men that are attracted to these movements and the type of vulnerabilities that those men possess that are being preyed upon by people in a position to misuse whatever vulnerabilities that these men have for their own political gains. Um, all the same, the psychological, the emotional, the social makeup of the, the guys across the spectrum. I have found actually to be really, really similar, whether it's, you know, a matter of, you know, searching for meaning, searching for belonging, searching for a sense of purpose, searching for a brotherhood, camaraderie, searching for just a way of coping with a very, you know, quickly changing world, um, finding themselves to be insignificant, powerless.

Speaker 3:          01:59          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:00          And then you have recruiters and you have these movements that are filling those voids actively and cynically actually filling those voids, not by accident, but actually by design. And I find that really troubling. But I also find that quite hopeful. Um, because I think that these basic human needs, I mean, I am searching and have been searching for all of these things that I've just listed as well. You know, it's just, it manifests itself different for me than it does for these guys. And it's just for me, it's a matter of figuring out how do we satisfy these, these needs for young people? How do we satisfy and address these vulnerabilities that that young people have? And also how do we confront the feelings of shame and humiliation and powerlessness that so many people feel before they become instrumentalized by our politicians and by populism. So you found a group regardless of yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:56          How it superficially polarized the group identities

Speaker 2:          03:00          of white supremacists or jihadist may seem that there's a kind of uniformity. Absolutely. So, absolutely. Because, because the, the, these movements are meeting these young men, predominantly men. I mean, obviously there are some women that that's important. I do, I think gender is a tremendous part of this. I think, I think a sense of masculinity or a sense of sort of toxic masculinity I think is absolutely, absolutely essential to this, to both movements or to any kind of extremist movement. Um, and I think that's also systematically overlooked. I think the way that our media addresses extremists, and I think the way that all politicians address extremism in, in general, I think is not very helpful. They constantly want to make it something exotic, something so impossible and monstrous because surely we can't do anything about this. These people are just hideous. They possess these hideous views and less just sign them all off.

Speaker 2:          04:01          And that's not the truth. The truth is they're all operating out of really basic needs and those needs are not being met in their life, in their immediate family life, or in the wider society. That says more about us as a society than it does about these men. And so I'm interested in that. I'm interested in, in, in finding an excavating what those needs are, what those vulnerabilities are, look extremists of any kind of stripe and, and, and, um, any form flourishes in, um, in vacuums, right? So you have Hamas and his wool line. All these kind of, you know, big names that we've heard of. They provide in, in circumstances and environments where social services do not exist. Education does not, you know, uh, does not exist. Uh, uh, healthcare does not exist. They are filling those voids. So whether it's political voids, it is economic voice, or it is social and emotional and psychological voids in the lives of people. These extremist groups, whatever their brand is, are fulfilling those, knowing what these lax and these voids are in people's lives. So why do they know that while they doing that, and we are not, why is our political system not addressing the social and economic and the political grievances that our young people have? Yes, it does. And again, it doesn't excuse the way that they're choosing to express that. I think we can say at the beginning that no one's is seeking to excuse the behavior of extreme.

Speaker 3:          05:38          Yes.
