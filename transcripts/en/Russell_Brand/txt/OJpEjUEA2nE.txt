Speaker 1:          00:00          Given that your person who tells stories in the way that you do, it's not like people just liked guns. Why is this idea so irresistible to American people? Why? Why isn't it like, you know, like you see sort of like a speech after sandy hook or wherever. And is that all right? That's the day now where we don't have guns anymore, but it's just like, no. Why? Why is this so powerful? What does it mean to their,

Speaker 2:          00:24          which is a, which is an excellent question and I guess one of the best ways to explain it would be, and you touched on it there in terms of tapping into some core things about how America feels about itself. They've got nothing to do with guns but work quite well with guns. So, um, when I used to go to the NRA, I went to a couple of NRA convention, the National Rifle Association, which is the gun lobby and the vibe, like weird, weird. I'm kind of, um, so a lot of white guys, that's the kind of 90 percent of the demographic, probably more, although they're trying to push guns in, in more in women's direction, so lots of pink guns and nice things that you can carry your gun in and kind of ways to look pretty with your guns, stuff like that. But um, um, lots of white guys and it almost kind of almost sexual relationship to these, to these weapons, you know, they're kind of the stroking them and kind of, you know, the, the, the, the, pouring them basically.

Speaker 2:          01:37          And I would really play up my englishness in these things. I mean, first of all because it, you know, it helps and secondly because it mitigates the blackness. But you throw me now and I'm like Downton Abbey coming out of your mouth, you know, from Steven and I've got another puff daddy. I'm looking at Puff Daddy, but I'm hearing Downton Abbey. If I could explain stevenage too, then that would sort everything out. So every, most stevenage is a shitshow. You can continue with your prejudices. Crazy in Essex to stevenage and I that understand this, or rather I don't understand this, I'm explaining it to me and to a person they were off to the races. They'll say, are you married? Do you have children yet imagined someone broke into your house and they wanted to rape your wife and kill your children and take everything that you worked for what you're going to do.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Uh, you can, uh, waiver sticker them. You're going to call the cops and wait for the cops to come, or you're going to defend your family and defend what you meant. And so it speaks to your kind of masculinity. Homestead, a small government individualism, a notion of kind of might being right, defendable shows. Now the reality is, well, there are several kinds of facts that contradict that. Especially most people who were shot dead killed themselves. Second day after that, you're much more likely to be shot dead by someone you know, someone you've done so well I should say is, are you married? Yes. Well, watch out for your wife. And so, um, they are, um, survey evoke these, a very primal yes, um, things in the culture and when confronted with that, if you start talking about background checks and um, you know, banning semiautomatic weapons and stuff like that, it's not really a match for the basic ideas of American individualism, small government masculinity and so on. You're talking about tinkering. We think so they, they have a powerful narrative that they can tap into and the gun control people done.
