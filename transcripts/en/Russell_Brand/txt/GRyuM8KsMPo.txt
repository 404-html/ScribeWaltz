Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Jason hickl is an anthropologist at the London School of Economics. Originally from Swaziland. He spent a number of years living with migrant workers in South Africa studying patterns of exploitation and political resistance in the wake of apartheid. Alongside is ethnographic work. He writes about development inequality and global political economy for the Guardian and other online outlets. His new book, the divide, a brief guide to global inequality and it solutions is out now. Jason, welcome to under the skin. Thank you for having me. Russell. Is it an honor to have you on? You're actually a doctor.

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       I am, although not the kind of, it can save your life, sadly.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Good. Because you know, I mean, we could talk about medicine and all that kind of stuff, but I'm much more interested in talking to you about, uh, global inequality. I thought one things after sort of like recently having had, um, Al Gore on the show for example, and talking about huge issue like climate change. It's interesting, I feel to listen to the framework within which these conversations, particularly conversations about significant change at, they take place within a sort of an identifiable framework. I wonder if you could talk to us, give us a bit of an overview of global inequality, uh, how it, how things stand economically, how we got into this position, and then we'll crack on from there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       Well, I suppose the place to start is what do we presently think about global inequality and what's kind of happening in the world? So there's, there's actually a dominant narrative out there that comes out of the World Bank predominantly and gets repeated in the media quite often that global inequality on, again, a global scale is actually diminishing along with globalization. So we know for a fact that globalization has caused inequality rates within countries to get worse, but the arguments from the World Bank is that on a global scale, it's getting better. So the media picks us up. Uh, again, this happened most recently, a couple of years ago, and argues that, look, globalization is actually good for the poor of the world. Uh, you know, it's working. We should keep doing it because it's the moral thing to do. So what's interesting is if you look behind those statistics, you find that there are actually quite misleading because a, they think about global inequality, um, uh, as if everybody in the world is part of the same big country, right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       And so on that basis, it does appear that global inequality is diminishing, but only if you include China and East Asia. Now, interestingly, the, that's the only part of the world that has not been forcibly globalized, um, by the Washington consensus under US pressure since the 1980s. They basically, uh, transform their economies according to their own standards. So it doesn't really work to have the narrative work that way. Now, and here's the crucial point. If you look at global inequality between regions of the world, between say the global north and the global south or rich countries versus poor countries, what we see is that rather than diminishing global inequality is getting dramatically worse since the 1960s, uh, the, the per capita income gap between the north and the south rich countries and poor countries has tripled in size. And that's really, that's really a dramatic, to me, a dramatic condemnation of, uh, of globalization and pointing out that it's just not working for the vast majority of humanity. Um, the majority of, of the yields of global capitalism are going to rich countries. I think that's a big problem.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       I suppose in a way it would be obvious that globalization would increase inequality is globalization is a term which really covers the power of transnational corporations to have one market place regulate it in a way that's beneficial to them. So it kind of makes sense that that would mean that money was traveling in a particular direction and it wouldn't be beneficial to the poorest and most vulnerable people. How, how are these myths sustained, Jason? These ideas like, like trickle down economics and mass production that the ultimately all in it. Like how, how often have nearly a century, uh, or these kind of ideas sustained. Is it kind of a form of propaganda and the management it's the same stakes as you've already mentioned?

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       Yeah. Um, first I just want to briefly touch on what you mentioned just now with trickled down. So if you look at, um, at all of the new income generated by global GDP growth over the past couple of decades, GDP, gross domestic products basically measured as the s the increasing size of the global economy. Um, only 5% of all new income generated by global growth has gone to the poorest 60% of humanity. So that's an extremely slow rate of trickle down. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       It's barely trickling down at all. It won't even get there. It'll be a vapor by the time it's halfway down.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       That's exactly right. Yeah. And economists have pointed out that at that rate of trickle down to eradicate poverty from the face of the earth, which is what we technically theoretically want to be doing, a would take over 200 years. That's how slow it trickles down.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       If there was any intention to actually eradicate poverty, this is not the means by which she would do it, then. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       That is definitely true. And that's what, that's basically the argument that I make in my book, the divide. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       the reason to have intention to eradicate poverty, hobbies necessary is in it for the global economic model. Hey, see, you're an anthropologist, doesn't ever, apologies means study if she human behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       Yes, that's, yeah, that's anthropology. Uh, so my, um, my anthropological work is focused on a particular part of the world that South Africa. I'm originally from Swaziland, so it's quite close to where I'm from. And again, I look at patterns of migration and exploitation in that region, but uh, but just I guess just by virtue of having grown up in Swaziland and then moving to the states from a university and phd, um, you know, I was really grappling with this question of why are some countries so immensely rich and consume so much while other countries are so miserably poor and have been for such a long time. Uh, so I guess that's the question of, of why the is divided as it is economically as really exercise me. And that kind of led me on this really 10 or more your journey to, to understand more about how the global economy works and write that up in a way that the average person can understand.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       So the aspect of anthropology, the interests you is the movement of resources and capital. And systems of dominance. And after your decade of research leading to this book of yours, the divide, what are your most important observations? And uh, I'm glad that you said in a language that anyone can understand cause I'm anyone. So can you put it in a, tell us what your most important observations are?

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       Well, so I want to go back to the question that you asked earlier about it's going to be, I'm going to ultimately answer the question you just asked right now. You mentioned this thing about narrative, right? Uh, what's the narrative that sort of keeps the system chugging along? And it was a brilliant question actually. So, and I think that probably, uh, you know, the, the center of this narrative is that, um, you know, rich countries have become rich based on their own hard work and they have the right policies and there's smart, etc. Etc. Whereas poor countries or poor because, uh, you know, they have internal policy failures. Maybe they're corrupt me that maybe they have bad climates, not enough resources, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, but rich countries a very generous and what they do is they give generously of their surplus across the divide to poor countries to help them sort of a up the development ladder.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       And so we hear this all the time from our politicians talking about the, uh, the international aid budget, the foreign aid budget, and on a global scale, the foreign aid budget that flows from rich countries to poor countries is huge. It's $130 billion per year right now. That sounds like a lot of money. And it is, that's about the a, the equivalent of all of the profits of all of the commercial banks in the u s combines, uh, that, that goes from north to south every year. But, um, if you look at all the money that flows around the world, way more flows from south to north on an order of magnitude, then trickles the other way. And I think that is really the, uh, the key point that we need to make here. The aid is not flowing from north to south. It's flowing from south to north.

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       It's flowing in reverse. So basically poor countries are developing rich countries, rich countries are not developing for our countries, so that they're the, the, that that flows from north to South East contextualized his aid and that that flows from south to north is content's job contextualized as good business is economics. But really you would taste sort of post colonial exploitation. Yeah, you can see it as, as plunder or you can see it as tributes and, but he, here's a really important fact. So, and this is actually quite recent data. Uh, so I guess it was a December or January, um, an an institute in Washington DC called global financial integrity, partnered with the Norwegian School of economics to do the most comprehensive study of financial flows around the world ever conducted in the world, uh, in history. And what they've found is that poor countries are net creditors to rich countries, um, uh, to, uh, on such a scale that for every dollar of aid that port can receive from which countries, uh, they lose $24 in net outflows, right? I mean, so basically the south is effectively hemorrhaging to the north. And this happens through all sorts of flows, like, um, illicit financial flows that basically corporations stealing money out of poor countries and s and storing them in tax havens, uh, many of which are controlled by the city.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       London. When you say stealing money, what do you mean by what means?

Speaker 2:          00:09:09       Uh, yeah, so this, there's a mechanism called, uh, called trade miss invoicing. And basically the way this works is that a company will, uh, we'll falsify it's trade invoices when it's exporting goods out of a poor country into a rich country. Right. Um, and by doing that, it can actually end up taking, uh, taking money offshore, putting in a tax haven. And it's very difficult for customers to stop this. Um, it's a practice that's been legalized basically by the WTO since 1994. Um, again, and the WTO of course, is controlled largely by rich countries since they have the bargaining power. So they were able to sort of establish this rule, which is deeply detrimental to poor countries,

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       but he's like apparently neutral governing and regulate. We bodies are in fact, in a way the administrative henchman of a system of globalization. It's based on exploitation of poor countries.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I should write that in my next book. Cancer. Um, yeah, so you know, so if you look at, if you look at just illicit financial flows alone, uh, then that's over 1 trillion US dollars that flows from, from poor to rich every year, uh, which outstrips the aid budget itself by a factor of 10 a right. And there's all sorts of all sorts of other flows like, um, like the interest payments on foreign loans that port companies have to pay, um, profit repatriation from multinational companies, uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       I suppose part of your point then, Jason, is that many of the systems that we consider to be sort of objective and just are kind of administrative fictions, perhaps the economy itself and even something like a GDP, it's just an idea. It's not earn an objective reality. Is that part of what you're saying mate?

Speaker 2:          00:10:53       Yeah, no, absolutely. Uh, and I'll definitely want to talk a bit more about GDP and how that is a fiction of our imagination that's become quite destructive. But, um, but just to, just to go back to what you were saying earlier about these admin administrative bodies who Ronnie sketch sharing a question. Well, you mentioned, you mentioned these global administrative bodies and it's not just the WTO, it's also like the World Bank and the IMF. So look at Netherlands,

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       those acronyms, acronyms. I've always fought IMF wb out of ways. Like whenever I see stuff happening near dodgy.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       Oh they, they are definitely dodged. And here's the deal is that the World Bank, the international monetary funds are a, are basically the institutions that control the rules of the global economy right now. And here's the thing, they're profoundly anti democratic institutions. So rich countries, which have a minority of the population of the world, um, half about 50% of the vote in these institutions, the u s government has a veto over all major decisions made in these institutions. The whole thing's pointless anyway. I mean, yeah, it's deeply, it's a deeply compromised system. I think it's a, and for me, you know, the problem is primarily that it's anti-democratic. If you were to, uh, um, you know, open up the WTO and World Bank and International Monetary Fund. See real democratic practice doesn't give poor countries a fair voice in how the global economy is run. Definitely we would see dramatic change.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Okay. Shell oven buggering about with it. So, okay, so that'd be a o Imf, all those things I keep, I know I'm listing boxing organizations now called the mcgregor fight, fill it bay where I say that. Um, hey, give us some more of those statistics there. Sort of a mind boggling like, uh, like how can we, how can a, an ongoing narrative and narrative be the depletion of poverty when you EGA billion people are living on less than a dollar a day. And the one that saw voice clumps me in the face when I read it, the richest eight people in the world control the same amount of wealth is the poorest half of the world's fault.

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       That's a killer facts. It's horrible. Um, so I want to go to the poverty number that you just mentioned. So, and that sounds about Nicole. She said, I don't have a system now that's, uh, you know, the world, the World Bank and the UN are telling us that, uh, the number of poor people in the world is between 700 million and 1 billion people basically right now. Um, and what they've been saying is that that number has been decreasing over the past 15 or so years. Um, because of their, the way the good things that are doing basically through aid and so on. Um, but if you look at how they measure poverty, uh, there's a real problem at stake. Um, that that number comes from a poverty line. That's a dollar 25 per day right now. Um, scholars from all over the world have been pointing out that nobody can live on a dollar 25 a day. It's a totally ludicrous, immoral number. Uh, so in order to achieve the most basic levels of human subsistence, uh, to achieve normal human life expectancy, you know, to have a decent chance of surviving pastor fifth birthday, etc. Etc. You have to have at least $5 per day, right? As like a moral minimum. They called us the ethical poverty line.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Let me just get below that moral minimum.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       Exactly. So here's the thing. If you measure, if you measure global poverty at that level, then it's not 1 billion people in poverty. It's 4.3 billion people in poverty, which is 60% of the world's population and the number has been getting bigger over time, not getting smaller. And so again, I think that the narrative that we have, um, that comes out of some of these bodies that don't worry, poverty is a diminishing and equalities diminishing is just not true. And if you look at the scholarship behind it, we see exactly the opposite story. And so we really have to ask ourselves, why is the global economy is so fundamentally flawed? This to fix this problem, to make it fair, um, is going to require more than just tweaking around the edges of the bit of aid here and there, uh, but rather fundamentally reorganizing the system.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       How on Earth, what will you fundamentally reorganized system when the system is clearly beneficial to the people that control it?

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       That's a good question. So, so, um, you know, I guess you can think about it this way, um, in terms of is this possible or not? Uh, so I have lots of students, a lot, a lot of my students come in like, you know, deeply concerned about poverty and inequality and so on. Um, and they get really interested in, in, uh, in solutions like, you know, micro finance or foreign aid or whatever it might be. Um, uh, but the problem is that the solutions that they're interested in don't actually target the real structural causes of the problems that they are so concerned to address. If we can, if we can get messages out to, to, to these students who fill the development industry and all the development organizations that are out there that are trying to tackle these problems, that what we need is to tackle these, the, the real deep structural drivers that causes the problem in the first place. Uh, then, um, then you know, the problem can be solved relatively quickly. Go on. Uh, um, so, you know, I mentioned one of the, one of the top solutions for me it would be, it would be democracy and the institutions of global governance. So, um, and they're all sorts of proposals out there. I mean, this is demand at that global south countries have been making for a long time for a fair, for fair reason.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       Cause I never hear those arguments so that they're afraid is that been going? Can we have a bit of democracy in these world governance organizations? And that message just never gets it

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       fair. It never gets tired. Um, yeah. So, you know, I think that there's all sorts of other interesting ones. Like for example, um, there's a huge wage differential between workers and the global north and workers in the global south. Um, and a lot of that is due to the fact that multinational companies can move around the world looking for the cheapest possible labor. The workers can't move across borders as freely right now, which is horrible. So what that means is that workers on the path to try to compete with each other to drive their own wages down. Ah, and that's really been, it's horrible

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       Gyn. That's a horrible, this Dystopian, it is already living in this type. Yeah. Yeah. We are in the global north luckily. So that's something,

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       yes. I suppose a, although it's not totally clear to me that we really deserve our privileges here

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       and also we are not part of those eight people that have got off of everything our years, sadly not. So like as you say, it's deep structural change like that. Like when I was talking to Al Gore who was absolutely lovely, a lot of people said talking at our golf around fairly in my view like that. My main point was how can you have significant change within a context that is designed to prohibit real change. And once when Yanis Varoufakis was here, he said, he said that, you know that wolf gang showers at him democracies. Okay. As long as you don't change anything. So as you are now saying, Jason, systemic change is what's required now. What are the air like? So what I feel like I want this podcast to do is marshal people's attention into the correct areas. Instead of going, no, it would be nice to have some micro, like your lovely students coming in on day one and they're big lovely scarves and their rosy cheeks or full of optimism. Instead of that saying, well, what is it? What ideas should we be pushing? What should we be campaigning for? Nave mentioned democracy at the level of global, uh, of institutions that glove govern global finance as one thing. Okay. We've remembered that. What else?

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       So in order to really understand what's at stake here, I think that we have to understand how a global inequality came to be as extreme as it as it is right now. Right? So we needed like some of the historical perspective there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Okay, I'll handle this one. A lot of people are very, very lazy. Then there's countries, European countries where we really were an industrious bunch and we crack shot. I've got a lot of things done. Now is there an alternative version? So the alternative version is that we might want to start with colonialism, right? Um, and if you want to look for sort of like the origins of it,

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       of mass poverty, it really is. It really is under colonialism, which was basically a process of mass displacement of peasants from the land and, uh, and a total wreckage of a, of local economies. Um, so we know for a fact that during, during the colonial period, uh, in most regions, um, income growth, real income growth per capita was about only 0.5% per year for the entire colonial period. Uh, meanwhile, as a result of colonialism, um, rich countries like Britain, uh, got to grow at a more than three times that much. And so that was a major driver of inequality. But he, but here's the interesting point. It, and if you want, we can go back to colonials and at some point. But, um, but in the wake of colonialism in the two decades after colonialism ended in 19, in the 1950s, in 1960s, there was a complete miracle in the global south.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       Um, you know, they suddenly had a democracy and they had control over their own economic policies. And what did they do? They elected leftist progressive leaders and they brought in tariff protections to protect their markets from a cheap goods from abroad. They, uh, they nationalized their own resources. They nationalized, uh, a lot of big companies and banks, um, you know, the increased labor standards, they, they, they redistributed land from rich land owners to peasants. And with these policies, they were remarkably successful. Would you mind telling us, I mean, it was all over the global south, but you can, you can see it, I guess most, uh, most clearly I suppose in Latin America. I mean, look at what's happening in, uh, in Chile and Brazil and Uruguay. You can also see it, and I'm in parts of the Middle East, like Egypt's in East Asia, this is very clear as well. Um, so

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       unshackled from colonialism found its way towards policies, socialism, nationalism, redistribution of wealth, management of trade and I suppose systems that we're focused on. People rather than profit broad.

Speaker 2:          00:20:31       Exactly. Yeah. And they, and they were using, and they were using their, their national wealth to invest in things like education and health care. And so, as you can imagine, you know, poverty starts diminishing and the gap between rich countries and poor countries starts closing for the first time in history. It was really a kind of miracle. And you think that rich countries, since I always go on about wanting to develop poor countries, it'll be very excited about this trends. Right? Finally, you know, there's success and poverty is reducing, but quite the opposite actually what we see is that, um, rich nations feel that they're losing their access to cheap labor and cheap raw materials and the global south. Uh, and so, you know, the, the access they'd enjoyed under colonialism and so they start intervening, uh, violently by deposing a lot of these progressive leaders, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       So I remember reading all those about those leaders. They're a horrible bunch. Yeah. Globalization's just colonization by another name. Um, yeah, I suppose. Yeah. Um, but you know, what's interesting is that a, is that, you know, the, the series of coups that started unfolding, um, led by Britain and the US and France and Belgium. What were we doing? We were funding who's very rear, either overthrowing leaders in the global south ourselves or we were funding movements to overthrow them or we were just supporting right wing dictatorships to prevent a democratic revolutions from happening and the froth and really love it. Barry, go get, as I say, we are in the global north, so I suppose it, wow, that's a fascinating, I didn't know that that's how they can, a very short period of time postcolonial Lee economic disparity was decreased because people obviously acted in a kind of a national self interest, not this sort of rampant individualism and inequality producing systems that we have grown to know and love.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       But these are about all of these regions where pretty much successfully the stabilized in that that movement was quashed. Right. Well, the other movement was quashed, but it wasn't actually by the cous. Cous cous took a really big tall, right. And the most famous of these is the coup against Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973. And you can watch footage of it on youtube actually, bizarrely. But, uh, but so even despite these interventions, the global south was still rising through the 70s. Okay. Um, but then, and, and, and the global north in the form of the g seven literally sat down around tables, leaders of the g seven sat there aren't done round tables to figure out how to stop this movement. The movement was called Developmental Wisdom, uh, and, uh, and it was very successful and, uh, and they couldn't figure out ways to sort of block this because it was becoming very powerful in the halls of the UN, which was a democratic body, global south countries.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       We're winning a new policies that were fairer for them basically. Um, so, but then in 1980, the tables turned dramatically in a single crazy events that changed the global order in one fell swoop. And that was the third world debt crisis. So basically the, the U S Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates, um, uh, you know, to really high levels, like 20% and global south countries, we're heavily indebted, um, in US dollars. They suddenly were not able to pay their debts back because of the interest rate hike. And they slid to the brink of default now. And if they, if they were going to default, Wall Street would have basically collapsed. And so Wall Street talked to the u s government and said, please, you need to bail us out. You need to solve this problem. The US government talk to the IMF and said, you are going to go and roll over the debts of those developing countries, uh, on the condition that they adopt what we call structural adjustment programs, which basically means liberalize your trade, uh, cut your labor rules, cut your environmental regulations, uh, privatized your companies and your assets, um, uh, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:24:15       Well, Naomi Klein's it was about in shock doctrine is unit that the sort of basic policies lead to destabilization. If those regimes just one putting on a pick up on that Jason and see that 20% hike by the Federal Reserve, was that part of the scheme? How can they get that? So that was not exactly part of the scheme actually that had to do with um, with a domestic problem in the u s at the time. So the US was suffering with what we call stagflation, um, start closure to doctor Tracy, who's Mrs is involved, will know our culture. Well I'm embarrassed. It was basically high levels of inflation but low levels of growth. And so they had to figure out some way to, to increase levels of growth again, because the rich people were really upset that they weren't, they weren't gaining, uh, you know, a fair income share.

Speaker 2:          00:25:02       And so they figured out that they could, if they raised interest rates, it would basically cause a recession in the u s it would empty out the, is break the back of the labor unions, which are very powerful at time and a and decrease the price of labor which has succeeded in doing, um, and as a result of the cost of labor in the u s has not risen since 1980, if you can imagine that. So it was, it was to solve a domestic political problem, but I had these ramifications around the world that changed the way the world works for ultimately for the benefit of the same interests. No, because the Wall Street said to IMF, go roll over these lounge. They said, we'll do it. As long as you adopt these systems that are amenable to our world view and everyone's cushy jobs or garden, you're very good at describing these things in a way that, uh, I can understand because I understood that justin now good. I'm angry about it. What we're going to do. Um, yeah, I'm hungry too. And a lot of guys, I would say most people in the world angry.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       And you know, it's interesting as the people were so angry that they took to the streets and masses, right? So this, so these structural adjustment programs cut like caused per capita income growth rates to collapse from a high of 3.2%, which was really high for the south down to 0.7%. Basically economic crisis, right? In Africa, we start incomes actually decline over a decade or more. I mean, this, this caused millions of people to be pushed into poverty. It was a complete travesty. Uh, it was the greatest single cause of poverty, um, uh, in the 20th century after colonialism. So people understandably took to the streets, um, uh, in what we called IMF riots, uh, you know, but what's, what's interesting is that, you know, and they complained to their governments, they were like, look, you know, stop these austerity policies. Basically that's what they are. Um, you know, we want to go back to the fair economic policies we had before. Um, but here's the thing is that global south countries themselves, the governments themselves couldn't do anything about it because control of our macro economic policymaking in, uh, in these countries had been shifted to bankers and technocrats in Washington, in New York. Right? And so in fact, structural adjustment had worked as a kind of bloodless coup, if you will, in one fell stroke almost. They were able to establish effective control over economic policymaking processes in the global south.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       So in a sense, democracy at their level of a state level was irrelevant and redundant because the economic strings are held elsewhere. And brought, you just said there, Jason, about economics, the economics, he's not some objective sciences. Yanis Varoufakis anywhere in there. And as I'm learning from you, it's just a model for man for maintaining inequality that all of these systems are all trouble by certain people. Some people are allowed to shift the rules, change rules, some people aren't. And it's a way of continually managing power.

Speaker 2:          00:27:51       Yeah, exactly. I think that's so important to understand is that is that flows of, of resources and wealth around the world all have to do with the rules of the global economy and who gets to set those rules. Right. So, um, in, in the 1980s, basically beginning then is when a power over these rules was centralized and in Washington, in New York, at the World Bank and in Wall Street and the IMF, we've got to get rid of with them every well, you know, and what's, I mean personally, yes, I do believe that. Um, and I don't think that's a radical position actually since, um, most people in the global south have made the same demands for a long time. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       why can't, I'm sorry for asking questions that 12 year old to ask, why can't the like some of those countries in the globe which have to go in and pay in that stuff? No more like these are what happened with Greece. Is that what they did? They went because you were just saying pain. You mate, why can't you do that?

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       No, I think that's such a good question because the other option the global south countries had, instead of submitting the structural adjustment would have been to just default on their loans. Right now there's, there's some problems with that. A, um, in the 1980s, uh, somebody tried. Okay. And this is, this is such an inspiring story. Um, there's a guy named Thomas Sankara. He was the president, the revolutionary president of Burkina Faso, a west African country. He was a young man. He was a brilliant social reformer. He was considered the Shag with our of Africa. Cool mate. And you can listen to his speeches online. They're amazing. He's really an inspiring guy. Thomas Sankara. Thomas Sankara. Yeah. And Thomas Sankara as president of Burkina Faso stood up in the halls of the African Union. Um, in the early 1980s, I went to say, and, uh, and he gave his famous speech against debt. He said, um, you know, comrades, basically debt is a form of neocolonialism.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       It means that the west gets to control what happens, uh, in terms of economic policy in our countries. And this is what he said. He said, here's the thing about debt. Uh, if you do not pay it, nobody dies. We surely die. And it was interesting cause the room electrified and he basically like started a kind of a revolution against the debt, right? And three months later he was assassinated in a French backed coup. So, and so here's the thing is that, is that it does it for Thomas. He's a good looking guy too, I have to say.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       All right. Then she's come up with a brilliant bloody revolution against that. But when we would have a look at him in a minute, oh, he sounds like a bloody hero. So a lot of these terms. Right. That's interesting. So like, like I like that there is a sort of a, another way of crow barring sort of colonialism in to the mix. When I was thinking about like, you know, these rules, people think about these rules. He's economic rules that dominate global trade, global trade and the flow of resources around the world as a sort of objective. But they are of course determined by the powerful. So we should look very carefully at these non national transcendent global organizations such as the IMF and other things I keep thinking of of wrestling organizations because they are set in the structures that mean that change is impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       Another thing that just occurred to me is when people say like, you know, what's the answer? Redistribution of wealth. But redistribution of wealth, what's been happening all along the wealth of the south has been redistributed, uh, north. And of course this isn't just happening on a global level. It's happening on the level of caste and class within each of these countries because there's loads of people. Of course you look out this window here in London, Leicester Square, and you'll see people that are in the globe and global norm and it ain't going to well for their mind or they're sleeping out there on those streets. Now. Like I suppose really what's required is an ideological shift. That's the, you know, the, the, the self corrective measures that were applied in some of the countries in the 70s that brought about that economic miracle on a national level of socialism, nationalization and our protective trade tariffs. It's almost like at this point, we need a way of, excuse me, presenting those kind of ideas on what our global level or just popularizing the idea so perhaps parties could run on them. Cause I saw him, I was doing it now after what happened with [inaudible] in Greece and you know, like, and sort of what's happening in this country of Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders in the, in the USA. I sometimes think, well, if the, you did have a lead like Corbyn got in, would these global institutions prevent real change from being enacted? What day?

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       Yeah. Um, well, are you going to answer a question from this morning? I suppose, yeah, I suppose one of the most important interventions, um, is to cancel the debts. And I really mean that. I don't mean like let's, let's forgive some ducks, which suggests like somehow they sins

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       raw these debts anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       Well, so that's, um, most of them actually were accumulated during the 1970s after the oil, after the oil crisis in 1973. Um, basically what it meant is that in order to, uh, to, to fund their own consumption in global south countries had to borrow tons of money because the price, the price of oil was so high. Um, and so a lot of these deaths are actually still hanging around since 1972 some even older than that. And because of the miracle of compound interest, many of them have been paid, paid off many times over already, and yet they're still paying them off. And so it's kind of this, I mean, it's, it's a problem in two ways. Uh, it's kind of a flow. It's like a flood of cash that goes from poor countries directly to banks. Mostly in rich countries. Um, and the other thing is that means that that governments don't have effective control over their own policymaking. Economical. So if you cancel it, that's a, in a, in a radical way, which would require of course, um, global south countries getting together to resist a debt to refute, to collectively refused repayments. You know, they can't assassinate them all at the same time that we look bad, bad, right. Then, uh, then you know, then you free, then countries are freed up to pursue policies.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       Fellows like you don't want the nor for the, you know, canceling them. You just want a sound guy. We ain't paying him. That is, it's not, we're not Bam, you canceling or not, we're canceling them. We're just not paying it. That's sort of what's required now I suppose what historically what the panel have been, I've been, as you say, the assassination of people that propose those kinds of measures and the replacement with regimes that are friendly to the objectives if the, the, the institutions that continue to benefit. So what was I suppose like interesting is whether or not new alliances can be made, because I feel sort of naturally more of an affinity with the people that would be canceling that rather than the debt is, even though I'm, you know, here in the lovely studio in the global north and I'm doing pretty well.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       Yeah. And I think that that's maybe increasingly true because if you look at the number of people who have student debt in the u s I mean that's a, that's $1 trillion of student debt right there. They also realize that there was a real problem with the debt system. Uh, and if, if you, if you can start building sort of at least conceptual alliances across, um, across these different classes of debtors and I think that you can, you can sort of free yourself to imagine a world without it canceled debt. Yeah, exactly. Where resistant. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:39       One of the things I was thinking again with ankle, we're just like that like with we are prioritizing economic systems, which are fictions of fabrications, certainly concepts that have been created by mankind with firing them over actual factual material, physical things like the planet and meteorological systems. And again, with all this, like with what you're saying about debt management and trade manipulation, some countries have resources, so like how has the country like Africa that it's mineral rich or like Latin America, we've all of its agriculture and minerals, how were they poor? If you can produce those things, then that's it. You've produced those things. Sure. We clearly what's required is like on one level they a different way of looking at economics on a global basis, but that's going to mean the obviously what that does is it challenges the interests of the people that are in control of the system as it currently stands. So ultimately you arrive at a point, don't you, Jason, where what is required? It's not an like you've said these things out loud. Now these ideas are out there, so what do you do? You popularize these ideas. At what, where does the rubber meet the road? Is our American coffin say, where does it become like, well, we're not doing this, we're not doing that. We're going to shut down this. We're going to shut down that who is the enemy? Who Do we target? Where do I stand or do we do?

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       Um, yeah, that's a good question. I'm not sure I'm going to, I guess we could brainstorm right now, but, but for me, um, you know, the important first step is to free ourselves of these false narratives about aid and development that we have right now. You know, the right, good. Done. Yeah. So, um, and then, uh, and again, you know, uh, debt cancellation I think is essential democratizing the world system. The central, I was going to mention earlier, I was going to mention the importance of a fairer international wage system. So, um, you know, again, wages in the south are much lower than in the north, if you, you know, and it's possible actually to, to bring in a kind of global minimum wage system. It would be governed by the UN through the International Labor Organization. And you would set the minimum wage at 50% of each country median wage and basically, uh, you would eradicate working poverty, pretty much overnights. Um, and this proposal's been made by number of economists. We know that there's a system in place that's capable of handling it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       What's the counter argument? Why do people say you can't do that by, that would lead to it. What is their argument for why you can't do stuff like that?

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       Oh, I guess there are going to be that's um, you know, uh, well I guess I guess proper new liberals that say you should never regulate wages. Um, but, but here's the way that I see it, right? If we're going to have a system where, uh, where capitalism is globalized, then it only stands to reason that we need a system where the rules that regulate capitalism or also globalized. So, um, I guess that's the way that I would,

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       so if you have global free movement of capital, you need global free movement of way, uh, of workers. If you have global capitalism, you need global regulation if the way that people are paid. So it's a really biased, messed up system. Tell me about like, just having a look at some of the bogey man of the system. Who's benefiting from this? What about companies like a big billy Elo, sue's superior, a transnational companies like apple, uh, what's going on with them? Haven't you got some sort of terrible thing to tell us about them?

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Um, yeah, I mean, I guess, I guess apple is only one of many companies that, uh, that only really exists because they're able to, uh, to exploit very cheap labor and the global south. Um, and you know, at some point I think, um, trump even said to the CEO of apple, you know, you need to bring these factories back home. It was a trump or maybe somebody else. And he was like, look, these factors are not going back home. Basically. Apple cannot come, has no business model.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       Oh. Unless we've got little bullies mining in Africa, like I looked at, we saw we'd made a, like a, an episode of the it on a news thing. We do. And it was when it Gareth, it was that some, some just arse achingly terrible thing about little children are mining for this results that's in your iphone. And he sort of watch it and think, oh bloody hell. It like you sort of unimaginable uh, in a dry, what do I want to say? Sort of negligence, cruelty, irresponsibility that we don't really countenance when you hold an apple iphone or an ipad in your hand, you don't think and you're encouraged not to think of what the consequences of that are. And for, and like we're, because I haven't, we already been bread and inculcated to think as consumers, you know, I think it would be very difficult for me as an individual, although I am willing to do it to get to let go of, you know, this product or that product, this privilege, that privilege people continually.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       If you're, if you're not sort of basically homeless or living in a commune people, so why don't you give up your call and then what did you can about this then don't you go at that? And, and I think these things are all valid arguments as part of a sort of a mobilization of significant change. But you can see that any gestural move from any individual is of little value unless there's a sort of targeted change. One of the things I read once in adbusters that I really liked were saying like pick a couple of corporations to really target and annihilate that, you know, sort of saying like if you, you know, you could sort of like they, they've, they outlined how a few corporations are hugely transgressed. General Motors with their irresponsible, you know, not recalling cars that they knew were killing people because it works out economically better to leave them out there and pay the lawsuits or Phillip Morris knowing for years that their tobacco is killing people.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Or even what you're saying there like a, you know, a big friendly and attractive organization like Apple Look, you know, whose products I own and use and will use within the hour. You know, like, and people will be listening to this podcast on those phones. You know, we are all participating in it, but we're participating from this position. It seems, Jason of impotence. And like I feel that because they are really what we ended up discussing here isn't narratives the way that stories are told, but we don't think it's possible to have significant change unless we come up ourselves with stories, ideas, objectives that are accessible and attractive. Change won't happen. I don't know how to sort of start, you know, getting people out on the streets, banging a drum to bloody demetra, democratize the IMF. I don't know how to make people do that. I, you know, like, or interest people in that even,

Speaker 2:          00:40:55       uh, you know, here's the way that I think about it. Um, I guess I, I guess first of all, uh, you know, this idea of, of seeing about changing our own personal consumption habits, I think that is important. But what's much more important is that we organize collectively to create a system in which it's not, it's not possible in the first place that apple can be exploiting workers like that. Right. Um, you know, so we need to kind of collective solidarity before we just need personal responsibility. Um, so, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       do you feel collective solidarity with, you know, do you feel that as a man, do you feel if that's something that you experienced, you're an anthropologist or an economist, you're teaching young people about this stuff, even though you're only 34 years old, you're like some sort of gorgeous boy band professor, sorry to objectify you, but you did it to that man in Africa. So unlike, you know, so do you feel the sense that this kind of solidarity, I'm even now watching a man who I imagined from Latin America emptying out garbage here at global, uh, and let you know, like, and, and you know, this is everywhere. This is all around us. This is us. And you know, the, I find it very difficult to get purchase to understand how, what shall I do now then? And I think there is a real appetite. I think the sort of, the surprising result of the last election for the success of Bernie Sanders to a degree.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       I like all these things, points of people's appetite for change. And like it's only the fact that stories like, you know, I grew up like when our garages for old at that coup in Nicaragua and you know, and Bloody Pinochet and all that, you just think that's how things are meant to be out. It's got to be, I even like the struggle in Ireland, I sort of grew up with the view your spouse to have, you know, it's like, you know, it's very difficult to get these stories out there. How do we emotionally engage people around sort of economic arguments that always feel abstract cause they are bloody abstract. Unless you're a little kid mine in for some minerals somewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       Yeah. No, I think that's absolutely right. We need better and more powerful and can more convincing stories. I mean, think about the power of the existing development narrative. So we need something that will tear that apart, but also, uh, you know, create a rival to it. Right. And the thing is, you know, there's no question that, that, that we are more inspiring and more convincing. And the thing is, you know, I can see it in my, in my own students, right? Like they all went to change the world. They have these little ideas about aid and microfinance. It w as soon as you explained to them how the world actually works in terms of the global economy, uh, and point them in the direction of real structural change. There are so excited about that. And now imagine if the millions of, uh, of people in Britain who are part of gap years and other like student development projects or NGOs, uh, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that are in the industry. Imagine if that was channeled in to making the world fair. I mean, it would change radically, radically and dramatically and would not require a single drop of additional foreign aid, uh, in order to eradicate poverty and inequality.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       So it seems like it'd be nice to have like a little five point plan of five things that would radically change the world, right? You go right, here are five ideas that if these things were implemented were radically changed the world. And then the next thing you'd hear is the people whose interests are currently being served, telling you aggressively, repeatedly why these things won't work and what, and then, you know, probably about time issue personally say that you're mad and you don't ever, you know, write to express those kinds of opinions, all sorts of stuff that happened. But it'll be good to distill it down to five simple things. So what are some of those ideas you were saying? Massive debt cancellation or for everybody cancel all that. That's a really cool one. I'd like that. And let's get rid of my mortgage. I'm in and like, and like, um, and um, what's the, what are some of the other ones at global minimum wage of 50% of that national median. Absolute. That was a good one. Yeah. That we're aiming for now. We of a few more cause it literally tried to organize a global revolution during this podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       Oh, cool. So, uh, so in the, in the second to last chapter of my book, I actually have in fact a list of exactly five things we can do to change the global economy. It's allison. So we've already talked about a lot of them. We have debts, we have counseling debt, we have the, the changing the wage system. Um, we have democracy, democratizing global governance of economic policy. Um, I think that there, there are easy ways we can, we can change the international trade system to make it much fair to poor countries as well. So, you know, right now, for example, you know, right now, uh, because of the WTO is your way around, which came into effect in 1990 is a global south countries are losing on average 700 billion US dollars in potential GDP per year because of imbalances in the, in the WTO trading structure.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       So, and that's seven times more than they receive an aid, right? So this is a major cause of Glen Mullen and 80 relevant. It is completely irrelevant. So in the book I lay out ways that we can change the trade system. Um, and then also I think that a really crucial one here is thinking about climate change. Because here's the deal. We know for a fact that the vast majority of historical emissions, uh, 70% of them in fact have come from, uh, from industrialized countries in the West. Okay. But the vast bulk of the consequences of climate change are hitting the global south really, really dramatically, uh, through wildfires, droughts, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, so, and, and as a result of climate change, Global South countries are losing in the region of $500 billion per year in terms of losses and, uh, you know, which again outstrips the aid budget by a factor of five there. So we needed, we need much more rigorous action on climate change to, uh, to, um, to get rich countries to reduce that

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       points point to all the, all of these proposed regulations mean that powerful economic interests will be curved and confronted. Can you imagine them ever like, like sort of history sort of looks to me like at a glance, and that's all I've ever given it. Like a saw a struggle between the powerful and the powerless with the powerful conceding the bare minimum amount of power. They can concede everything. Oh, bloody hill. Women want the vote. All right, we can't have slavery anymore. Oh, right, okay. Let me in. They just stopped. But they'll go hang onto it for as long as they can and then give the minimum. And in each case you would say, well, you know, like here we are all these years after suffrage and women is still exploited and not paid as much as men in the United States. Look what's happening around race and continues to happen around race. So these things in a sense, move slowly unless they're sort of radical systemic change. And do you think it's unlikely for radical systemic change to be bought around without force and death?

Speaker 2:          00:47:18       Um, yeah. So, um, I agree with you and I think that basically the system we have right now is a kind of global apartheid. Uh, and it's, uh, and, and just as the anti apartheid struggle in South Africa required, um, you know, immense collective mobilization, uh, I think the same as going to be true of the struggle. We need to abolish global apartheid. And, uh, we'll, it's, will it end up, you know, and conflicts. Um, it's definitely possible. And historically when attempts have been made to make the world fair, then that has been the case. Um, but you know, what, what, what is promising is that, uh, is that people around the global south are, are increasingly conscious of how unfair the system is to them. And they are the majority of the world. And, and, and, and the more and more that we include them in our, in our, in our discussions and our, in our discourse, through the Internet, through our media, et cetera. Um, you know, the more of this message is going to come through.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       But how do we galvanize some working class white bloke in dunk cost r and d day six, you know, because they similarly are suffering as a result of this economic system. But they're not going to start thinking, oh are, you know, identify with some bloke in Chile, you know, how do you have a global movement? You know, like this isn't just happening in the global south. Like during the time that we've been doing this podcast, you know, there's people probably minimum wage worker. Cause this is a business that I imagine would not take the risk of paying people below minimum wage, although they'll probably outsourced to a cleaning company that are using people that have got, knows how their document it or whatever, you know, to like say like this is not hemispherically divided. This is everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       Yeah. I think that's definitely true. We can definitely see elements of the south right here in the north. There's no question about it. Um, and not just actually people from the south who are suffering, you know, among us. But uh, but the same dynamics, um, uh, of the south like, you know, slums and horrible health care, health care conditions and so on are present. Right. You know, in global north countries themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       Yeah. Cause you are an expert. If I'm picking up from the intro online, sort of f no graphic stuff. Right. And like, but like in La, so all this Charlotesville Lark, it's call it last week, you know that sort of like why you went to university. Can you imagine? Kidding me. Crazy. So what do you think? Right. So what do you think about that? I mean like, you know, like sort of for me, once people start parading around getting all Nazi, that's sort of a clear indication. They feel hugely the disempowered. Like, you know, while people will say, Oh, you know, under the sort of covered trump administration, people would feel it. It's more a somehow acceptable to express more extremist views that that may be true. But also those people must be feeling something in order to do that. You and nine know, and most people know that what they're targeting is incorrect and immoral, but what they're feeling is real. They are feeling something. They're feeling anger, right. How do we reach those people? Or do we just go home? Forget it. They're not as well, you know, I mean, cause I didn't feel that way. I feel like, oh this is, these people need help.

Speaker 2:          00:50:20       Yeah. I mean, I completely agree and I'm very torn because on the one, on the one hand, you know, I think that we absolutely have to fight fascism wherever it rears its ugly head. But on the other hand, we do have to feel a kind of compassion for, uh, for, uh, at least, at least for those who, who reached these conclusions because they feel immiserated are dispossessed or something like that, uh, in, in, in a legitimate sense. Right. Uh, so, so to the extent that there are people who turn to these narratives, these white nationalists narratives because they feel that the system is screwing them, uh, in some real sense because the system is very unfair. And let's be honest, I think that absolutely we have to, we have to work on building their consciousness. Um, to the extent that these people have not been misdirected, but are nonetheless still racist pricks, then we can't give them any of our compassion. That's, I guess that's kind of the way I feel about that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       Cause I don't let that, you know, like I don't know why the practice is because I'm a white man. But like I, I feel like when that sort of stuff happens and I look at their faces with those torches, he's weird stuff, man. And I feel like that we, I feel we can't leave people behind. I'm not suggesting, you know, it's obvious my allegiance lies. We have people that aren't marching around with torches. But like I feel that unless you address the resource rage, the feeling, unless people like get it goes well, who should they be angry with? Their unhappy. I don't think you can get people a march around in the streets of the taught unless there's something really seriously wrong, you know, enlightened. Unless that's addressed then this we'll reformulate and re manifest the way that is clear over the course of our conversation, Jason, that the exploitation that came with colonization route simply re presented as globalization that behind the mask of, uh, the, the previous national identity core per identities, we're able to continue the same exploitation, making little nods and gestures here or there when it became impossible to not do that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       But to make significant change, you have to start dealing with what people are feeling, what's happening in people's hearts and minds and spirits. Cause he's really excellent to hear you outline how these things have happened, why they've happened, and what would need to change in order for significant redistribution or a fairer society to a merge. But like a tear, unless people can be emotionally engaged. I don't see how that will happen because I think most people will have a vague idea. Everything is corrupt. Everything's, you know, you can't. But I think people also feel broadly impotent.

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       Um, I think that another, another thing we have to consider here is that, you know, the, the south might just take matters into their own hands and already, you know, and I guess in a way, like we're kind of irrelevant to the, to the struggle. I mean we in the West, like we're obviously on the wrong side. So, uh, so if you look like, if you look at what's happening in the south already, you know, you have in Latin America you have, um, a number of governments working together to form kind of like, uh, like alternative trade networks that's, um, that are, that are based on fair principles. And, um, you know, you have, you have the rise of alternative alternative institutions like the, uh, the brics bank and the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank that are trying, that are to provide an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and render these, these big global organizations irrelevant right now. We don't know if that's going to work or if they're going to be instruments of sort of sub imperial evil for the countries that run them like China. We don't know. But uh, but at least that's what people are trying to do. And there's some hope there I think

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       and perhaps behind these ideas. I wonder, it's like that when you were saying this stuff, like when do you think of it? Right? You know, how we regard the global narrative like oh no, this is just the way things are. Some countries have reached, some countries are poor. It's because we got our got our up off our power, our season invented the spinning Jenny and then and then the Vdu and you know behind sort of within this there are sort of concurrent narratives around things like Darwinism that underwrite that kind of philosophy. Survival of the fittest. Life is a struggle for original season and that's just a way it is the fittest and the strongest and the best survive. These are already sort of selective narrativize patients. If history, the mechanism, the mechanistic model of the planet, the world is a bit like a machine evolutions, a bit like a machine selecting and making binary choices like it's not as we are a underwritten by that kind of philosophy then why would we be compassionate or why would any emergent system not resort ultimately to like you said, a sub imperial or comparable trend, you know like setting up some rival economic model that China's involved in.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       I don't know much about China but there's like, I don't look to me like their friends over there, fred in flowers for each other's air and giving each other massages. It looks like they could be a pretty leery bunch as well if it all ever kicks off. So unless like, you know, where are the resources for these rules, where, where are we going to come up with a, from where do we reach inside of ourselves and find a philosophy by which we can legitimately live and call ourselves human and call ourselves brothers and sisters and custodians of this planet. You know, we're what is going to be the resource and this is the bit where I go. It's spirituality.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       I think that's, I think that's actually so important. Uh, I think that we have, we have to start realizing that we are all connected, um, that you know, that we're brothers and sisters. I think that's so essential in it sounds, it sounds so silly to say it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       That's because we've been taught to think it's all silly so that people can crack on and exploit everyone who don't say that to lead to be broken and sisters right now shut up. You know, cause you're an individual.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       If globalization has done anything good for us, uh, um, it's, it's the globalization of our sense of connection. And, um, you know, I think that that, uh, you know, we're, we're definitely more aware of each other right now. And, um, I think that, yeah, we need, we need to realize that, uh, in order for us to, to create a world where, where we are, we're able to eradicate poverty, um, we need to learn how to share. I think that's so fundamental because the narrative that we'd been sold from people in power is that the only way to eradicate poverty is through GDP growth. Right? But we know that on a limited planet, which is what we live on a and in an era of rapid climate change, continued GDP growth is not an option. So without, without growing the GDP and having some of it trickled down to the poorest, how are we going to eradicate poverty?

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       The only way to do it is to share what we already have more fairly. And that's gotta be a realization for us. None of us want to live in a world that's marked where 60% of the human population isn't. It is in poverty. Right? Uh, if you talk to the average bloke on the street, they're not going to want that. Uh, and so the key is, is to realize what's necessary for us to create an alternative world. And that really is sharing. Uh, and that's exactly the opposite kind of narrative to the one that we've been fed all of our lives.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       That's right. And it's been underwritten again by different aspects of science and philosophy. Darwinism. Is it like a survival of the fittest and not suggesting that evolution isn't real? Of course it is. It's empirically and provably and demonstrable. He will, but the implication that we should be competing with one another for resources is there sort of, that's conjecture. That's just an idea at different idea will be, we should be sharing that we are here together, that our life is individuals is not as important as our life as a community. Gout, what did you hold up a question? Just their mate. What was it? And this is a question, Jason, I've just thought up with using my brilliant little brain. Is there any hope within current global power structures? Are there any good guys, any we can look to optimistically?

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       Um, don't feel obliged to say me. That's all. I think there's some interesting people, you know, I was talking about structural adjustment earlier. Crucially, those exact same policies that were imposed on the south in the 1980s are now being imposed all over southern Europe. Right. And Greece of course, is the, is the, uh, the key example of this. Um, uh, so Greece is being structurally adjusted for the sake of bailing out French and German banks. Basically the same thing that happens in the 1980s for the south and a so, and so you have the emergence of a, of resistance there. And the form is the result, or at least it was I kind of resistance and Yanis Varoufakis and skate. That dude's cool. He's a cool guy. Yeah. And I, I like what he has to say. Um, but it's not just him. There are also people, you know, elsewhere in the south. I think that, uh, I'm the President of Columbia, create a gang

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       global crusaders, a bit like the marvel avengers franchise and I'm in it as well. And we will go round coming up with brilliant ideas and then that means of going into manic trances, preaching it all around the world.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Yes, I definitely want to do that. This whole soap speaking him Shamana chanting. I really liked the point you made about spirituality and a, and this is why, because I feel like, look right now the, the levels of consumption that we enjoy in the West are completely, uh, are completely based on extraction and plunder in the south. They depends on the immiseration of people, uh, in, in, uh, in poor countries. Now I think that that actually probably plays really, really badly for our sense of psyche and our inner wellbeing. I think that none of us want to live in a world like that where deep inside we know that every, the, the things we consume in the privilege that we have depends on the suffering of other people. I think it makes us all like deeply anxious on some even unspoken level. Even if you don't acknowledge it. And so, you know, in order to have a kind of inner healing, we have to, we have to live in a world where our daily actions are not creating misery and the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       That's beautiful. We'd need to become conscious. We need to become awake. We need to think, how happy is that phone making me? How happy are these trainers making me become aware? Don't be distracted. Don't lose your connection. Connect to who you really are. Any books you weren't going to recommend for us. Obviously your book, which is called the divide, a brief guide to global inequality and it solution brief a, it's very, uh, it's basically this, my bangs right on. Then it, how many pages?

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Um, it's like 340. I think that includes and notes and stuff. You'd have to read those bone. I'm going to tear it out as soon as I get it, that whole bit of the back. I'm not hearing it right to a copy. I'm going to sign it for you. I'm going to try to kiss it and touch it and cuddle it. Um, I guess I would recommend, you know, one of my favorite thinkers in this field is a guy named todd. You're in Chang, a brilliant professor, uh, in Cambridge, and he wrote an amazing book called Bad Samaritans. And I'd definitely recommend that people read that. What's his name again? His name is hodge. Joon Chang. Hogene Chang. He's from South Korea.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       See, I find it hard to remember. Non Christian sounding names. What's the, who is that African bloke? Thomas. Well, Thomas Sankara, Thomas Sankara. We're looking him up and watch the South Korean economists

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       fellow. His name is, uh, is how Joon Chang.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Hi, Joon Chang Thomas Sankara. Next week there will be a quiz. If you don't know anything about those two people, you will be banned from downloading this podcast probably from itunes, which is all part bloody problem. But we will use these tools one day to bring about a better world. Jason, thanks for coming on our show. You've been absolutely alumut brilliantly illuminating, so clear, so wonderful. I feel smarter already. I've memorized some of those things you've said. Well, wonderful guest. You are. Thank you. Thanks Russell. Thanks.
