Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Barry smith is a professor of philosophy and director of the Institute of Philosophy as well as the founder of the Center for the study of this census, which pioneers collaborative research between philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists is published on self knowledge, linguistic knowledge, consciousness, the emotions, taste and smell, and there's appeared frequently on BBC radio including the writing and presenting of a four part series for the World Service called the mysteries of the brain is also the wine columnist for prospect magazine buries me. Thank you very much for coming on under the skin. Pleasure to be here. This is a big subject to discuss the relationship between the senses and consciousness. The sense is, I suppose it's these are the avenues to experience these represent who we are, but it seems from even a cursory examination of your work, there is much misunderstanding about the framework of the centers. Can you talk to us a little about that note?

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       I believe the I aristotle and idea that there are about five. Yeah, I mean I think you're right. The sensors are our closest contact with the world. You know, that's how we know where we are, so we see things in front of us here, things are in touch with people quite literally taste and smell, and we've for a long time thought we just have five senses that whatever we're perceiving, it's got to be either seeing or hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and we get that from aristotle who told us we had these five senses. And it's strange because if you talk to neuroscientists as I do know, you ask him any senses of we got, they say anywhere between 22 and 33, you know, many senses. And it's kind of funny that we've given up aristotle's view. There were only five elements that made up the whole of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       Uh, we, we've rejected that physics has done away with it, but, but the idea that we have five senses has prevailed and that's what people think of when they think about themselves. The thing I've just got five, we go out now and we ask people in the street, they'll say five sensors. Sure. Lack of a safari. You sort of think elephants, giraffes, lions. So sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch. So like bit beyond that, we say, what is, what is the panoply of sense neglected? Well, let's just, just think of a few more sense of balance. If that goes off, you know all about it. I mean the world starts spinning so it's going to affect, you know, how your vision is behaving and your sense of balance is clearly important and on all the time if things are going well, uh, if people are home, wants to do this, you know, try standing up and standing on one leg and they'll wobble at all there.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Okay? Now try closing your eyes and standing on one leg and you'll find it's much harder. I know. You'll know that your sense of balance is actually made up of three sentences. Sight, proprioception, which is their sense we have of our own body from the inside. If you close your eyes, now you know where your feet are on your hands are without having to see them or touch them. You just feel where they are, but it's not by not by touch. So that's your proprioception. That's knowing where your body is in space, so that sense plus site plus these beautiful little ear canals you have, so you've got ear canals pointing up and down, backwards and forwards and side to side, and that tells you whether in a left you're going up or whether you're rushing forward and that combines with site and with a sense of your body to give you your sense of balance.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Am I lying down to my standing upright? My tipping over incredibly complex mechanisms which boundary our sense of self sensory deprivation. Then I suppose is an interesting area because it limits how we encode it. Limits experience and if the sensory deprivation tank or people that are blind from birth or don't have hearing that well, that that makes a big, big difference. So, so the funny thing about the senses is there a little bit narcissistic. They tell you about the world, but they also tell you about you. So they're giving you a sense of how you are and what's going on with you. So even as we speak now, we are making sounds that have a echo from the wall or from the table, the floor, and that's telling us kind of how much noise we're producing. But if you've ever been, as I'm sure you have as, as a, uh, as an artist who works in sound, if you've ever been in an anechoic chamber where there's absolutely no echo, it's frightening.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       You make assigned nothing comes back and you actually feel you're almost dead. There is a feeling that you've, you've kind of landed in some weird, strange world and the, and the thing is that your brain is paying attention to the, to the sounds you make in the world. So as you walk along the pavement, obviously your feet are making a noise, but you don't realize because you're not paying attention to it, that the brain has recording that signed. So colleagues of Mine and at Adora and affiliate Darwalla created these beautiful things. Sonic shoes. So you're wearing a, you're wearing a kind of flip flop and their little sensors in it and it's sending information up to headphones. And as you walk, they can make your footsteps sound heavier, louder, or make them sound lighter. And the interesting thing is that people's bodies behave completely differently when you make the sign from their own feet signed heavy, they slouched the lean forward, they look as though it's a real effort.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       And when you turn the frequency up high, so you just get this sort of light sign from the feet. People start leaping, they actually start moving more happily in space and you think that's incredible. You didn't realize that your brain and your body are trying to make everything fit together. You're getting signals from signed, from touch, from, from smell, from everything. And the brain is trying to put all that information together and to see what's going on out there. And how are things with me are experiencing realities, obviously determined by the senses. What are these studies, uh, that, uh, demonstrate that if you're asked to answer social political questions, for example, should there be more or less immigration that your response may vary if there's a presence of an unpleasant smell in the room? Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, that stuff's interesting because smell is the most neglected sense and if you asked people, I'm sure if I asked you now and you think, which sense of the five would you give up?

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       You know, if you had to, you're forced to. People always say, I give up sense of smell. They think not so important, but they're wrong. They're actually fundamentally wrong. Sense of smell is very important. Is that the oldest one? Yeah, I think it. I think it is. And and paramecium bacteria in our, in a jar have got receptors that respond to orders. So you know from the simplest animal up, smell is important. Now what? Why? Why is smell important? Well, it's, it's used to give you a sense of danger. If there's smoke predators, if you are an animal, we use it for attraction. So it turns out that you are most attracted to people who smell suggests that their immune system is further away from yours. So we're, we actually are, are not attracted to people who smell is going to indicate that there are too close to us genetically, that their immune system is too close to us.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       So you know, you might find yourself talking to somebody and you think, oh, you know, they are very attractive, they're very lovely, very beautiful, but if they smell wrong, there's nothing you can do, there's nothing you can do to over come that. And on the other hand you might have people you suddenly feel very attracted to and you wonder why. And it could be love at first smell. So your sense of smell is, is about attraction. It's also about recognizing your kin. If we give you a tee shirt, a that your infant has had on, you will know it's yours. You will know that an equally, you know, the infant will be able to tell that that's the mother there in front of it, from the sense of smell more so at first than from sight. And smell is also one of those things that tells us that everything is okay. So you no longer smell your own home.

Speaker 2:          00:09:00       Everybody else's homes got smell but yours doesn't wise. That's kind of funny right around this unite, like while you're telling me they stuff, giving you ideas. Well and also reminding me of stuff. Like what? Like I remember as I'm sure everybody does when you're a kid and you go around other people's houses, you smell it, smell of fish fingers in. So it was a beef burgers and you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       you remember your friend's houses and you're a member. You're relative sizes, you know how they smell and you and yet you think yours doesn't. That's funny. So what's happened is that you're so used to the smell of your own home. You've switched that off, but it doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's gone entirely because if you go into your home and say, oh, someone's been in here, someone's been smoking, or did I leave the rubbish out? You know, so you're on it like that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       So we're touching upon, I suppose to the idea that the sensory realm is establishing norms that we neglect information once we've judged it to be standardized. Yeah, I think, I think in particular that's right with smell, because you might think that smells job is to detect change. If nothing's changed, leave it alone. Why? Why? Why put the brainpower into maintaining a permanent of factory landscape the way we do with a visual landscape? Why do that? If it's not checkers? Still Beef Burgers, beef burgers, still slightly pointless data. That's ketchup. I don't need to bother, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       But also remember that when we talked about food, your sense of smell is actually the most important sense for getting flavor from food,

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       so without smell, they experience of gastronomy or cuisines. Nothing is nothing. In fact,

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       all you get, all you can get if you had your a nose clip on and we can put a pinch your nose tightly shot and try eating things. All your gets what the tongue provides salt, sweet, sour, bitter, savory. That's it, and yet you can taste cherry, pineapple, mango, strawberry. You don't have strawberry receptors on your tongue. That's all coming from smell. So if we took your sense of smell away, that's all lost and you often get patients going to the doctor, certainly an older age and they say, I've lost my sense of taste. Now a good doctor will say, put your tongue out. Here's a bit of lemon juice, or here's a bit of salt to taste that, oh yeah, taste that, but that's all I can taste, and now they realize how much of what they thought was taste is actually due to smell.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       It also seems very that the sensory realm, it is highly collaborative and this is analogous to what we're learning about neurology and psychology. I suppose that it's not like this is the bit of the brain that deals with fear. This is the bit of the brain. The centers are collaborating to create a perception of reality in ways that with them we may have imagined they really

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       are so, so. So that's the second big thing. You know, one thing is giving up five, many more than five, and the second thing is saying their senses are massively interacting. You almost never have an experience. That's just in one sense modality. In fact, the arts is the place where we think that happens. You go to a gallery and you think, oh, I'm just using my eyes, but in fact you're aware of the acoustics in the gallery. That's why if you're in a very big room with a high ceiling, it's very different from being in a kind of small, tight space, looking at the same painting. You're also aware of the smell of the gallery. I'm coming back smell one of my favorite galleries where I grew up in Glasgow, a art gallery and Museum Kelvin Grove, and when it went in for a 40 million pound refit and it closed for many years, the Glaswegians all said, don't change the smell.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Don't change the smell because they had been there as kids. They had gone back as adults. They had taken their own kids and it was that familiar smell of old stone and furniture Polish, which they wanted because it was part of their childhood. It's part of their memory and so the sensors, the sensors do make up the world. They don't work separately, but let me show you some of the interactions. I mean there are weird ones, so there are odors and shampoo that make your hair feel softer. Who Knew? So that sort of green apple you sometimes get in shampoos. It will sensitize, touch at the end of your fingers to make everything seem really soft and squeaky and lovely. There are interactions between how things look and how they taste. So if I give you two bottles of juice and and they've, they're just, it's just water with some sugar, a little bit of sugar in it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       One of them is lime green color died and the other is red color dyed. You're convinced that the rate is sweet and the lime colored is sour, so your eyes are overruling what your tongue is telling you. So there's this way in which the senses are talking to each other and affecting each other. Another nice example, my friend and collaborator, Charles Spence and Oxford, he gives people two bowls of yogurt and you get these, these bowls of yogurt and it's the same yogurt in both bowls, but in one of them there's a little weight at the bottom of it, so it's heavier. Now I hand you the first bowl, try that yogurt and do the second bold try that. You'll get which ones creamier, rich, thicker, and everybody says it's the one that had the little weight in it. So touch the weight in your hand is giving you a brain inflammation that it uses to say usually something that's creamier and thicker is a bit heavier. So if I'm getting something heavier, it must be creamier, thicker. So that's the way in which the other senses are working to give you an estimate of what's going on around you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Much of our conversation thus far has been about how the senses can be deceived. All those senses, I suppose operate on detecting patterns, consistency or differences you said, and constant begin to be, uh, negate or ignored. So, uh, what is initially quite interesting to me is that sensors are our never navigational tools for what is reality and if our senses are to a point unreliable or only reliable to a point, then what is our relationship with reality, how it affect. So

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       I think it's interesting that we often don't know how our experiences. We often don't realize that our, our experience's multisensory, you know, people think I'm seeing now I'm hearing and I'm touching, but in fact as we sit here, no, you're looking at my face, you're hearing my voice. You've maybe got the residual taste of tea or coffee in your mouth. Those, the smell of this room, it's its own particular ordering. You must know her very well. And, and all of that information is not coming in separate parcels. No ice, no out here. Now I touch. It's all unified in a single conscious experiences, a unified view of you and the world around, you know, when people have brain damage or brain injury and you take out some of those multisensory inputs if you remove them, things can go wrong. And then what gets unified as something that seems very strange to them, very odd.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       A lot of people just after having had a stroke, uh, where you know, the, the, the say their left arm is paralyzed. They're not getting the right feedback to know that they are ms dot paralyzed. And some of them people who have as as it's called, I know sick nausea, think that they've still got movement with both of their hands. And you say to somebody, you know, can you lift your right hand? And the yes and they do. Can you lift your left hand? They say yes, but the arm's not moving, but they don't know it's not moving. And so from the outside we think that's really strange. But what, what the brain is doing is saying, well, I'm whatever signals I've got, I'm going to try and make sense of them in the best way I can. And I think, I think you see the brain's job as putting information together and trying to make sense of it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       You see it yourself when you're dreaming. So you've noticed in a dream, really weird things happen. You're inside, you're outside, you're in a car, you're in water. This is a man, now it's a woman. Uh, I'm suddenly in a different location. And the interesting thing is that during the dream that doesn't seem odd at all. You just go with it is when you wake. You think that was very weird. I was a bit strange. So when you're in the dream, you go with all those strange distortions and a colleague of mine said, he thinks dreaming is the best way for the rest of us to know what it's like to be brain damaged, where you're getting false and or wrong signals from your senses, but the brain is still trying to make sense of them. That's why in the dream you'll put up with all sorts of weird things going on and in the dream it won't seem strange. So

Speaker 2:          00:18:22       the sensors are the tools by which we determine reality. There are various ways of disrupting our sensual sensory experience. Recently, for example, professor either go on a virtual reality helmet is a mate of mine. I was on in about five minutes. I come out of that thing. It might, but this is all bullshit. We really sort of affected my sense of connection to reality. It made me query how valid it was, um, to analyze that to your example of the dream state on awakening. I often feel this is a confection and some of these experimental examples that you provided or this is a nice creamy yogurt or was tails the apocryphal or otherwise that I've heard of, you know, if you spell rubbish or suddenly likely to be more conserving here, more pro the legal intervention. So, uh, I suppose what I'm fascinated by them and what surely must drive much of your exploration is that to what degree is there an objective reality? It's so easily alterable and modified.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       I think there is an objective reality. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm perfectly up for that. It, you know, I'm completely up for that. I mean, I think, I think, I think, yeah, I think the idea that, uh, you know, it's all subjective and it's all going on in my head. We, the world has a habit of impressing itself on us. You know, we, we can't resist what it does. And when you said you had the virtual reality helmet on and it was very convincing, two things about one is when you get the virtual reality helmet on, it's pretty important that you don't move, that you sit still with a helmet and you can turn your head, that's fine. But when people try to move around a room, they're getting a mismatch between the visual flow in the virtual reality scene and what their body is telling them about where they are in space.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Even if there's not an object just with their people then get really quite ill. Um, so, uh, in Disneyland, in Paris, when people are in this tilting a spacecraft and they've got this streaming of stars coming and they're in a star wars scene, they're going in and out of buildings and they're moving to the side and they're tipping upwards and backwards. So I'm going terribly well until when the film gets out of sequence with the movements, they call that Code v because people just start vomiting as soon as they're not getting the body feeling that the visuals are giving them an. That shows you why to be in touch with reality in the right way. Yes, senses. I've got to work together and they've got to give you a lot together. Fix. And, and the only thing about visual route is, you know, the sense that maybe that maybe we rely on for reality, most is touch.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       I mean if you see something and you're a little bit doubtful about it, you know, think of Macbeth looking at the dagger, is this a dagger I see before me, but I cannot grasp it. He wants to touch it to see if it's real. He's not going to take it that just because he's, he's, he's leaking, it's real. And if people say, Oh, I was pretty sure there was a ghostly figure. Well they want to do is they want to put their hand in it. So our sense of touch, even though we rely most on sight sensor touches, one of those, I think gives us more confidence that we really are connected to an objective reality out there. I wonder if this is underwritten by the idea of rational materialism. Wow. That's a big thought. And that unpack that for me, a little cry fest, but it was a beautiful little dot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       Unpack that for me a little. Well, Barry, what I feel is that it really beginning to see, whilst you say there is an objective reality and I certainly can't provide any evidence that any reason it'd be difficult for me to do that it seems that there is a forms that are gay that are verified more quickly. It's difficult to query that we live in a culture that is materialist and that means just incentive consumerism is that rationalism. What can be measured, what can be rezoned to post enlightenment thinking governs our times, our politics, our economics. So it seems to me that the, the US ideologically placing precedent on I can touch it, I can spend it, I can fuck. It seems to me quite animalistic and it seems to me that given that presidents, he's quite a political idea rather than, well, I can see this dagger in my mind and perhaps other people will see daggers in their mind and all the sides.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       All right, good, good, good, good thought. Let me, let me get back to, you know, give us a cuddles. Good look, because rationalism, as you're saying, the kind of rational economic drivers, especially among economists who used to think of us as, well, we're rational decision makers. You know, we're, we've got economic preferences and we'll figure out what we want and you'll be able to assess what people are more likely to buy in, in terms of what they believe and what they desire. And you'll just, you'll just do rational decision theory, terrible idea because we're much more moved by our bodies and you have a little bit of a fight back against rationalism when you realize we're embodied creatures and if we're paying attention, not just to, you know, our senses, bringing information from the outside, but say your heart. So lovely. Work new work by Sarah Garfinkel and Hugo critchley in Sussex showing that there's enormously interesting connections between the heart and the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       When every, every time the heart beats, it sends a signal to the brain and the brain has got a representation of all of its organs. The slow waves of the stomach, the liver, everything. And it's. And it's giving you an estimate of how things are with you. So here's the funny thing, some people can use that signal from their heart to estimate how they're doing and then that way to know their emotions better. So people who are good at being in tune with how the heart's rhythm is and how it's beating. They feel their emotions, their emotions more intensely, and they're quicker and better able to detect emotions in others. And we often say, if people are good at this, we often say, well, there, they've got good instincts or they're going on gut instinct. So we now are beginning to understand what that might mean.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       And I think that's been neglected. And I think when you imagine in the rational economic model that people are going to behave in the, um, you know, the most reasonable way to get what they want given what they believe in desire. You're leaving out the sense of from time to time. How are they feeling? How anxious are they? How, how upset, high relaxed I come. And the people who really can pay attention to that heart signal, they're the ones who are going to be more in tune with them and maybe less taken in by all the attractions and the distractions that materialistic world throws at them. Yes. Because we live in a world is overstimulating, and just with your shampoo example, you touched upon how I'm

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       necessarily mark in Hasta mislead overstimulate over demonstrate the capacities of certain products. Consumerism, in a sense, he's built upon the idea that a product can deliver an experience that's beyond the rational.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       Yeah. It's all about experience. So people in marketing no longer talk about products. They talk about experiences really. And they also have this new thing which is interesting. They talk about we must get beyond liking. It's not about liking, it's about an emotional attachment to the product. So if you can get somebody sort of emotionally engaged as people are with their equipment in a apple Mac users, an iphone users, they're really emotionally invested in it. It's not. It's not just a that's good. That's useful. I like that it works. There's an emotional attachment to it and you might even look sniffily at somebody sitting beside you in a cafe if they are on a pc and not a Mac. So, so a lot of that is being cultured and cultivated. That's right. But I think there's, we've got to be careful because while I think there's a lot of wow materialism that's about misleading people, I also think it doesn't, it's not, it's not harmful if we think of better uses of, of marketing, not to mislead, but to lead people to experiences that they want and they need and that they could, that could be better.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       Making People's food healthier, making people eat less fat, salt and sugar, but not making it so horrible that they don't want to have it, you know, making something delicious, desirable, getting them to pay attention, slow down, be mindful of the food they're eating. If we can think of ways of doing that, you might give people experiences that were more satisfying and they'd be sated sooner and they weren't constantly stimulated and craving, you know, give me more, give me more. Is that unlikely that that will happen? Because there is no imperative really other than profit and what? Oh, I don't know. I mean, I think there's an imperative, certainly, uh, when, when you see governments are very worried about the amount of money they're spending on, on, on obesity, they're very worried about, uh, you know, health risks to people. Now government do really is the imperative for profit still in it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       You're in a different form. It may be because they want them to be healthy and be able to contribute to the picture being ill. No, to contribute to the capitalist culture at well, enjoy life and, and, and work and, and, and spent well, look, I mean all of us want to try to slow down that cycle where we've made fruit so hyper palatable. It's so delicious. It's so full of salt, fat, sugar that people just want it, want it, want it. And also it's not surprising to see obesity numbers grow, especially in areas of poverty. Now that's just not fair because, you know, we're, we're, we're advertising to people. We're trying to get them to have these things, which, you know, a lot of companies now are, are bad few, but you know, people whose lives are hard, they're, you know, they're sort of left out of the great race.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       They're not feeling it's going to. Well, they are being encouraged just to dose themselves with something that's immediately gratifying. Look at supermarket, Look at supermarket advertising. I think it's really pernicious. So you've got. You've got it really is. I mean like you've got that thing. I'm a taste the difference now. What's that about? That's about saying if you're a bit aspirational, I'll offer you something a little more expensive and you will, you will reward yourself by saying, oh, I was able to taste the difference. I noticed this was better quality. It's fine now. So the other trying to get people to buy something a little more it. Which one is that? Which, which kind of makes sense. Now the other thing that just, just, just, just, just bloody habit. It's just habit. It's what I'm worried about because at the bottom end of the range, the people that they know are not going to pay more. For our final question. You're not going to be. They've got products that they say be good to yourself and I think that are trainable.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Yeah, look, I bought donut. Your life is. Your life is pretty hard. You're feeling oppressed and and hard pushed. You can't manage things. How about right now? Just a little bit of comfort. Take that fat and salt and sugar. I think that's a terrible thing to do to people. You're working in a fascinating area because the perhaps thinking about it now, it seems like the most fascinating because these, these are the roads between reality is one field that in reality as it is and that the unreliability of either of those preconditions, what is self? What is otherness? The subjective and the objective and how these two worlds a community. How do you use that? How does having access to this kind of incite change your life on a daily basis or we should changed it

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       for the better. I mean, I'm like everybody else. I'm as vulnerable to, you know, to mood changes or to, to suddenly feeling hunger or to wanting some gratification, but you know, when, when I'm thinking it through, I'm realizing that, you know, if, if, if things are going well inside of me, if I'm not having bad reactions, um, and I, and I feel that I'm kinda getting okay with the people around me, the, and the things around me. I must be in tune this. This is where the subject of an object of our gear shifted to fit each other. That's nice, but it often comes astray. I mean, people are sleeping badly. People are eating more than they want. People are drinking more than they want. Um, why is that happening? And it's happening because of the stresses and strains, the, the feeling of being left out and you see people, you know, the dispossessed that cheated of sunlight just being offered really bad goods.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       Really kind of simple, immediate pleasures. Now can we encourage people out of that? You've got to get them very young. It's got to be in schools. It's got to be a way in which you get people to be interested in not just a screen or or headphones, but, but think of the other senses as well. Think of the way in which you could get kids to be interested in what they're eating and picking out part and being kind of, you know, thoughtful and, and, and a good at describing it and being critical. In France they do this little kids are asked about the age of eight to, to ask their parents to send them into school with some unusual thing to eat. Maybe an unusual fruit or an unusual cake or whatever and the other kids are asked to try it and they're there to talk about it and they see, oh, that's interesting. That's a bit like pineapple. And you watch these little kids getting fascinated because they're learning about the foods, but they're learning about themselves, their own reactions. That's getting them better in tune to what's good for me, not just what is everybody telling me I should well until she'd have.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       Can you sense though, professor that places the onus on the individual and that is this a lot like, well, if you want to mark it to be a better, you should be a demand. There's a consumer, a recycling aisle where things are a bit more expensive when we all know that this is gonna be social, it's

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       a social, it's a social problem, but we just think of we're getting better now at thinking about social factors that affect us. Um, so neuroscience used to be all about the individual brain, you know, it was a very individualist sort of discipline. You're thinking, you know, what's going on in the brain of this person and how are they reacting to the inputs and the stimuli, how are they likely to behave? But now there's social neuroscience. People are really interested in how you're affected when having experiences by the presence of another person. I mean we all know if we're sitting in front of a screen watching a film, it's not the same experience as if we were side by side with people around us. If we were kind of sharing that and you know, setting up experiments where you're trying to see the extent to which people are aware of one another's reactions and judgments and that's a, that's a way of tuning their own being sort of emotionally regulated, not just by yourself but by how it's going with other people, how much pain I feel and how I react to pain will be affected by whether there's someone present in the room with me and also whether they're a relative and whether this is someone I take care over, they take care of me.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       So I think there's, there's, there's a kind of sense in which we have been very individual, but we're getting better now at looking at how socially things are organized because these are further suggestions that there are modifications to our perception that are difficult to mechanically account for. They are difficult to mechanically account for. But, but here's the other thing. When you're making perceptual judgments, um, you know, is really boring. You're in a, you know, we're in a scanner and you're just watching a set of images being flashed up and you're asked, is the one in the left brighter than the one on the right or you know, tell us which one's brighter and you're just pressing buttons. If you get people to do that individually, a, they'll come out with a score, how accurate they are, but we are now looking at new research where if people make their judgments and express their confidence rating, how confident were you that that you got that right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Seventy percent or 80 percent and then people having done this individually are allowed to discuss with each other what their judgments were and to share their confidence ratings and then you ask them to come up with a collective decision. Turns out that the payers are better than the strongest of the two peers doing it individually. In other words, two brains are better than one. When you're making perceptual judgments, if you're a light to discuss it, you'll arrive at a better judgement if you do it together. Now just think of that and the consequences that has in general that a lot of the decision making that we go in for probably if we were allowed to discuss it with people, but it's got to be discussed in a way where, you know, nobody is dominating the discussion. Nobody's taking it over to brains being better than one is a, is a kind of new view because it, it, it affects not just, uh, thoughts about society, but even our perceptions, even our perceptions might be improved if we're light to discuss them with people of reality itself.

Speaker 1:          00:35:56       I have a cool something that Eei, he said when we spoke, uh, that there is no self. We exist in dialectic. What is reality if you're in an hour minium, captual drifting through space, which I suppose is a way of physically recreating the idea of a world stripped of senses, a world stripped of virtuous to otherness. Do you meditate? No, I'm a, I do other things that get me into that state. So, so here's what I don't meditate. I'll tell you why I don't. So I remember when I was a much younger academic and feeling all the pressures and very stressed and you know, suffering all the things that high stress will get stress. Well, stress because you're under pressure, you go to publish and you've got to what you're working on. At this point I, I was, I was doing very technical philosophy of language and logic and so it was.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       And you're aware of your own science. Very interesting. But I was glad when I started working on, uh, the connections to the sensors and started working in psychology, neuroscience. It's great to collaborate. I love collaborative work. You're not alone. But, but before that, when I was a younger academic, philosophers often work in their own study on their own, having the hard thoughts having to come up with something that's original. That's good, that's clear. But under those sorts of pressures I was getting very, very stressed and doctors would say to me, I think you should meditate. And I thought, okay, I'll, I'll try that. That may be coming down. And then what they do is they tell you, you know, you're, you're lying on the floor, your eyes are closed, you're very calm, and I want you to concentrate on the word relax. And of course I'm a philosopher of language and thinking the word relaxed.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       It's like relax. But it's not actually combined a relax. And I'm starting, my mind is just racing, thinking about the bloody word. So I thought, that's no good. That's not going to work for me. What I need to do is turn words off. I've got to make sure that, you know, I'm not having a word, the conversations that restless internal monologue that's going on. So do I do that. And for me it's always been looking at paintings and I would, you know, get myself along to the national gallery or wherever was close and I would spend a very long time in front of a painting until the voices in my head commenting on it, noting things calm down. And there's a moment when you stop sort of competing with what you're looking at and you stop giving your own imposition and you just let. What's their come to you and then you begin to really see what the artists or you begin to just let a painting speak and at that point the word SCO and it's a lovely meditative, calm state and I and I remain sort of emotionless, very peaceful in that state and it's very interesting that I must give off something because people who are inclined to sort of walk in front of you and the painting, they sort of noticed me and they make around the back as if not wanting to interrupt and I think that's the nearest I can get to kind of meditative state.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       It feels very good and the body feels very grateful. I think in some way for being in that state because everything has calmed down. The level of adrenaline has dropped. You're not on a layer, you're not sort of ready to react

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       for you. Then it's difficult to surrender their process of analysis and adjudication. But as you described the process of looking at a painting, you seem to me that you were saying that eventually you kind of melt into an experience of the creator, loss of self, which my own experience of meditation is somewhat about achieving sensory experience. Perhaps could be regarded as this forcing one's position. I am here. I can smell that. I can see that. I can hear that if that vibrations bouncing back at me, it means I'm in this kind of environment and those early example you gave of how we react to that, the device that makes our footsteps louder, it means that we continually reevaluating the parameters of self, what we are, who we are. I'm very interested in challenging the relationship between between self and reality because I'm curious about who authors, what reality is and what our role is. We talked already of the way that different supermarket brands would mark it at their potential customers who is designated in a kind of casual net crow politics to eat the salty, fatty foods and who can eat the lash tasteful goods. I'm assuming if you don't meditate, and I have not for years, but uh, um, taken psychedelics, I wonder if you're curious about your, uh, with your knowledge of neuroscience, about the, how Oh, mind altering substances and what they, if what can be a.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       So I think they are interesting and I think the, there's a lot of interest in them in the field of psychiatry, neuroscience at the moment now because you get that. Uh, I mean, like I, I can, I can remember when, you know, when you're hideously drunk and you're really, really off your face and your eyes look one way and then when you move them you feel the image didn't quite come with you at the right time and things are sort of shuddering and you see what you're doing is breaking down the way the sentence is normally cooperate with each other. And at that point you probably start to get a dissolving of the boundaries of the self. But no, no, not in a good way. A good way. And I think, I think that is interesting to see how the self is not as some philosophers thought indissolvable single constantly present thing that was there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       Which philosophers think that, well I mean Rene Descartes, I think therefore I am. And that self was a kind of enduring continuing presence. That was, that was you. You could take all the bits of the body away and there would still be there self, which was the thinking thing and it's, it's, it's absolutely not like that. I mean the way in which our sense of self is composed of so many components and parts that all have to be working seamlessly together like an orchestra. And then when they're unified you get that probably illusion that everything is, is in a single unified space. And, and actually I think you look at people either with psychedelic drugs or again, under extreme conditions of drink, or you look at people with brain damage and you see the way in which some of those things are breaking down and that tells you that it's not so obvious that that sense of self is in a permanent and reliably always going to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       It's fragile. It could be disintegrated. It could kind of fracture and fragment. And when you see people with brain damage, I think, uh, you know, people who disowned a limb or people who neglect everything on the lefthand side of their visual field or people who believe that they're dead. Or people who, who think that their relatives have been replaced with aliens or whatever. Those cases are often used in a very annoying way. Like a kind of a freak show circus where they say, oh look, you know, here's a, here's a man who mistook his wife for a hat. All of that stuff. And I think what we should say instead when we look at people with these funny conditions is why aren't the rest of us not more like them? Why is it that we don't have these weird and funny experiences and it's you know, there, there, there, but for the grace of God go, I mean if, if anything did breakdown of some of our systems fail to deliver what they usually do and what we don't notice they do. You would get a fragmentation of the self and we would end up in the way that a lot of patients describe her in the way that people who've been on lots of our to Jen's describe so, so, so we, we can be more sympathetic and more understanding. I think, of other people not like us. When we realized how much it takes to sustain this illusion that everything is unified and self-like and present. Furthermore, only a non anomalous experiences wouldn't warrant

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       observation. So we could be behaving in a way that is collectively hysterical. Yeah. Without it ever causing a glitch on the graph because it's because of. Because of our understanding of norms. Have you got any interest in the sort of changing morality, changing norms tastes the role of taste as in like, like this is good taste, this is bad taste. This is elegant, elegant. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       I have. I mean I think. I think that when you talked about norms, that's interesting because that which is most familiar we think is a permanent and has to be like that and it's only under conditions of brain damage or or, or an extreme or unusual anomalous experience. We suddenly realize, oh my God, it doesn't always have to be like that. Things could change radically. So I think the familiar is taken for granted. The familiar is taken as bedrock. It'll always be like that. This, this is just what it is to be human and then we realize, you know, slightly late and to our shame it's not like that. I think in terms of morals, the something like the same issue here, there's a lot of interest in, in clinical neuroscience on people who've had brain damage leading to them behaving in some morally a porn way.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       What like p two failures. So there's a famous case, you probably heard about the case in Virginia where there's a man who, who suddenly starts behaving inappropriate to his daughter and his wife report some and he gets sort of banged away and he's going to be given some remedial training, but he's got these ptfe like thoughts, but he's also complaining about headaches now. They take them in to the hospital. They eventually scanned him and find that he's got a huge tumor in the prefrontal Cortex, orbital frontal cortex here and the operating, the resect it, and they take most of it out. And then the pedophilic tendencies have gone away. Now the tumor hadn't completely gone away. It regrew and the pedophile tendencies come back and again, he had to be incarcerated. Now what's really interesting about him is that he knew it was bad to do this.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       He tried to hide what he was doing and he just, it's. He says, couldn't stop himself doing it. Now a lot of people, lawyers get very worried about those cases because they say, wow, the lowest be a defense in court saying, you know, my neurons made me do it. It wasn't me golf, but actually actually that's, that's they don't realize that's worse because if somebody says I couldn't help doing it, you're probably going to incarcerate them and keep them locked up for the safety of everybody around. It's not as though they're going to walk out of court free. If they say I couldn't. I couldn't help myself that they're going to be in a restrained, but what's interesting about his cases, he knew it was wrong and then said, but I had no way of controlling it. Whereas we often tend to think of people behaving in some morally apparent way.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       They don't know the difference between right and wrong. That's why they do it because they don't know the difference. They don't realize it's wrong. Now here's somebody who knows it's wrong and can't stop himself doing it, so we realize a bit more like addiction. There's something here which we need to separate out. It's not enough just to have good intentions to know what's right or wrong. How are you going to have the means to be able to follow it up, carry it out, resist something, not do that, and we're relearning that. It's a, again, it's an orchestration of lots of little systems and if something goes wrong, you're not in control of it. You're inside of your reach is an interesting ethical question because I suppose it's to do with determinism and personal foreign aid if, if at, because I suppose perhaps in centuries to come that will be seen merely as a obvious example, an outlier of the ways that all of our personal autonomy is being and the written or fueled by sort of neurological events that could be seen as a meet urology.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       Just the weather of our consciousness. I like that. I think it is the weather of our conscious. I think we're, I think we, we fluctuate and we're fickle. It's not surprising therefore that people, uh, are often compared to the weather, you know, because blue or stormy or sunny disposition. Yeah. But also we're not very good. Even though we've now got all these satellites and we're trying to predict, we're not very good at predicting the weather. Have you ever noticed when you get weather forecasts that the first thing someone who tells you is what happened today? Well, you know, there's was a high, uh, it was very high pressure and the winds were coming in from the south and then that led to the, you think, I know what happened. I was there. What they're trying to do is build up your confidence that once it's happened, they know why they can explain it and they're hoping that that will let you believe that they can now predict, but things still happen in the weather that were not predicted.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       And we suddenly had a rush of snow in the UK and boy, nobody was expecting that. It didn't. I didn't hear the weather warnings about it. So I think people are the same. Once somebody has, has, has acted. Once they'd done something, you can probably try and figure out why they did it and an attribute motives. But what we can't do is really predict what people will do. I mean, we're, we're just really not good at that. That's why people are like the way there we are. We're really not able to see in advance exactly what they'll do. They'll have tendencies. There'll be things that you, you kind of expect them to do, but I, I like the fact that people can always behave out of character and you can still make sense of it is challenges, doesn't it? The systems of taxonomy that we put in place that are, these group of people are likely to commit crimes.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       These group of people that are there, these people or be elevated and respected because there's too much complexity for these systems to be reliable and these categories are usually constructed with a particular narrative in mind. They are an just that phrase, these people. I mean, how dangerous does that sound when you decide that you're going to castigate a whole group of people as though you, you know exactly what they're like and how they're going to behave. Here's the terrifying thing. The more that we get information from neuroscience in courts, we see pictures of brains with areas that are lighting up and of course we know areas don't actually. It'll light up. This is just sale. Yeah, exactly, and it's also how we create the pictures that demonstrate where we think travel through language, but the power of image and a court is very strong. A lot of studies going on recently with Laura's neuroscientist showing that courts are incredibly moved by somebody flashing up, you know, an image inside a skull and here's a little patch of activity where it seems to be going orange and that's obviously why somebody behaves like that's his says.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       That's exactly what it is. And of course what the public don't know is that that image is not a single brain. It's none of a single brain never is. When you're doing scanning, you get say 30 subjects, your scan them all performing a task and you scan them all when they're performing some contrast task and what you're looking at is a computer representation of the average brain that shows the average activity difference between performing one task and another. So that's not an individual that's a, that's a statistical generalization. So while you might say, look for any 30 people, 26 of them are definitely in this condition, going to behave this way, there could be the one person who who want and who doesn't. And I think when it comes to making decisions about people's individual liberty, you're probably not wanting to go buy well statistically.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       People like this have, you know, re-offended or whatever it is. There's a study that was done in a New Mexico I think where they scanned the brains of a longterm inmates and then had follow ups of when they were released, if they were paroled and whether the rear fender and it turned out that getting people to perform go nogo tasks where they're, they're, they're excited and ready to press a button, but they might go to hourly and they might, you know, make an error. People who had no impulse control or very little impulse control, they, they, they very little activation in the anterior singular singular cortex and the brain, they reoffended more often, more reliably than people who had greater activation and more impulse control. Not turned out that when the study was done over I think a 10 year period, the, the neuro imaging scans gave something like 66 percent reliable judgment about whether someone was lightly to refund.

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       Whereas the parole board who are deciding it only had a success rate of 25 percent. Now what do we do about that? You kinda think, look, I'm, you'd want to get better than 25 percent of your guessing. Should we let this person out now or early or should we let them complete the sentence? You want to do better than I'm 25 percent right? That they'll, they'll dreadfully low. So 66 is better. And at the same time, again, remember the scanning data is averaging the result. So you might say, wow, you know, in general people with low activation here in the ACC, you know, on average most of them will re offend, but if you're the one who's not part of that data, a summary, are you going to stop that guy from being paroled? Just because you say, well, on average people do so that, that raises. I think for society that raises huge moral problems, this, this new knowledge is not neutral. We have to make some really tough decisions about how we use it

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       know so little is because of often where funding comes from. There's a usually a bias in that area. The incentives and objectives of particular institutions usually vested interests involved. A particular picture of reality is usually presented and preserved. One of the things I've learned over my personal, I was personally incentivized to undertake a process of conducting these interviews because I do a degree in religion, in global politics so vast, and over the course of these interviews, one of the things I've discovered and I'm sort of crystallizing in my mind, is the invisible caveat. Unless it affects the interest of the powerful, we must do something about climate change unless it affects the interests of the powerful. Every single conference, that ongoing conversation, it has this obscured never discussed piece of information that we are driven to conserve. We are driven to keep institutions invested, interests protected. Very seldom that they are challenged and one of the ways I've noted that that happens is placing a great deal of owners on individual choice, well, these people have done that and that you know, like that rather than acknowledging the role of states or transnational organizations in influencing people's. So the work that you do where in in its complexity and understanding the mechanics of the relationship between Invokana as an individual and an inverted commas. Again, reality seems quite vital because there are so many modifications that are altering what reality

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       is or our perception of reality. They're not altering relative, but they're altering our view of reality. We look at climate change as you said, that's a crucial one. The problem with climate change is not the science. The sciences in the science has done. The problem is people. There are companies, as you say, who do not want government into interrupting their business and telling them they have to reduce emissions and telling them they'll have to do something that, that, that threatens their profits. So that's our problem. How do we do with the people? That's the issue. It's not one more paper. One more piece of evidence is actually going to convince anyone. It's how do you deal with those sort of political agents of change? How do you hide? You Hide, you monopolize that. How do you get people on site to do that? That wonder. I wonder that too, but

Speaker 2:          00:57:33       it doesn't seem to be with rational information because as you said, the affirmation is, yeah, it seems like it would need to be where power is, needs to alter as long as power. The ability to influence remains with people that are in profit rather than a large number of people as long as power is not disseminating.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       So that will be careful with the talk of power. I mean, I know people will often just sort of reached for the word, but I, you know, I remember Tony Benn always saying, uh, if people have power, where did they get it? Who gave it to them? How do they use it often and yeah, and how they use it. Right? So, so, so now you begin to see we've got to look at those stages. You've got to look at power wasn't just in a, suddenly it was there and it was exercised. There had to be people who were, uh, agents of, you know, acquiring it and others who gave, gave in and seeded and said, you can have this power and I'm, I'm happy to grant it to you. So that's where those individual decisions and those, those judgments and those influences come in and they need to be looked at

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       really carefully. What fascinates me is that how much work goes into concealing power. We now sort of live in a time where it's like, well, where is this power now? If, if, if democracy at the level of the state seems to be retained within quite limited borders. It's difficult to access transnational corporations that they know that we purport to live by rationalism, but a rational decision on discovering that climate change is real and can only be effected if agriculture altars in this way and if energy and power companies or in this way. As soon as you know that, where is the resistance? And as soon as you could determine it, other, he's here

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       until you have purchase in that area. It's irrelevance. No point in telling people, put your bottles in this Bin and that bin. But it's never a good telling people what to what to do. They often don't mean think a thing of, I know more about his food and health issues, people telling them, telling others what to eat, what not to eat, what's good for you, what's bad for you, try to keep away from these particular types of food and so on. It never works. So what you've got to do is incentivize people in some other way. And with food it's always deliciousness. Deliciousness will win out. It doesn't matter whether you tell people you know this is the healthy option and that's the unhealthy option. They'll eat what they prefer and what they find delicious. But remember, as you're trying to get messages across about how you can find delicious food, if it's Vegan or vegetarian, I mean a lot of people becoming Vegan and a lot of people resisting it because they think, well, the food won't be so delicious.

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       So then we've got to make delicious Vegan food. If you're going to actually convert people to say, you know, you give up lots of, uh, uh, uh, heads of cattle, which are very expensive to be. If we can make something so delicious that you don't mind doing it, that's the thing rather than the moral argument. Some people are very principled, some people are very moral, they'll do it, but we'll move them. But remember, as you try to get people to eat better, you try to get people to have better experiences. You're up against multinational companies who are fantastically good, who've got lots of research arms. They are to find out how to grab people. If you look at mark, uh, uh, just jacket norris extra cars, shanker's book, the Dorito effect. It's fantastic when you see just how much work goes into making a Dorito so much more delicious and desirable than any other food from the, from the luke of the bag, from the feel of the bag from the moment you open it from the order that comes up from the slight spiciness on your tongue and everything else.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       Multinational companies are doing a lot to get you to engage with that product, so it's going to be a very hard fight and the way you're gonna be able to sort of wean people off things that are easy, cheaper, a desirable and delicious to something that's healthy is not telling them it's healthy. You just got to make better stuff. You're going to make things that will actually move them at the gut level, at the, at the smell and taste and the look and feel, or perhaps even beyond that gut level. Because if as soon as system in that, if I may say that the suggestion that people will only act, at least in this example on the basis of self interest of deliciousness, the experience of deliciousness is there. Not a moral equivalent to the delicious as sense of beauty, of connection, of gut shot and fraternity for sure, but I wonder how we access the access that you've got to have time and patience and a certain amount of leisure.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       I mean the people who pay a lot of attention to but you have got rather comfortable lives and an ability to sort of take time out and stop and be mindful and thoughtful about what they're interacting with and we, we didn't pick up on a point that you raised but we can come back to that just briefly on matters of taste. So it used to be that the way that you influence society was the idea of seeing that's very bad taste to, you know, to watch this television show or it's very bad taste to, to eat this thing or is there any, you know, it's very naf to have pineapples stakes with, you know, I'm a gammon stakes with a pineapple ring on it. The Cherry on the top, you're very knife let's, let's aspire to something else. But, but that was often those ideas of tastes and what people wanted to identify with.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       We're often in a dictated by people who had a, a kind of elite position who were frightening others into saying, if you're not like, as you know you're, you're not really making it. But I do think what we eat, what we do with our leisure time, what we, uh, what we drink, how we, how we spend any spare money that's all about who we want to identify with it is. It is a kind of identity thing and, and some very nice entity and otherness, identity and otherness. Louise excluded in this group who's not choosing what I do,

Speaker 2:          01:03:31       who's making an apple.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       Yeah. You know, one of us prawn cocktail really, you know, so that, that sense of wanting to identify. It's very powerful and it, and it does come through food and clothing and music and all the rest of it. And politically there's a, there's an angle here because once you've decided who you identify with, when decisions come along that you haven't thought through, it's much easier to say, well, who did it? My, what did the group identify with? Tend to say, oh, I'll go with that. And you're seeing more and more of that in social media. And I the fact that having already decided who you belong to, if there's an issue and you haven't made up your mind if your group, if your people decide one way, it's very easy to tag yourself on the back of that, but no, we are starting to get islands or people separated from each other because you're talking to the people who are. You're identifying with a not necessarily engaging with and listening to the others, and of course will make better decisions. Although it's uncomfortable if we have more diversity of opinion, we've got more. People are kind of challenging.

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       It's almost like we don't have geo tribes. Now we have an atomized online opinion groups to return to a point about beauty there for a moment, if you think of it from an artistic perspective, specifically the keats quote, beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That beauty is value is only in that it is an Avatar of goodness rightness. So I don't mean, but in terms of other, of course I do. And in terms of aesthetics and perhaps Oscar Wilde is a good vehicle for this, can you think of sort of like wild initially superficial seeming sense of aesthetics? Uh, on examination it seems that Wilde was particularly interested in truth, purity, innocence, like, so some charming ideas around Catholicism in these, right in about children. So like, you know, again, when we talk about the senses, it seems that there are ways of dialing up, dialing down in the bowl of yogurt, you know, optical illusions that we, even when you see them in a tabloid newspaper sort of dazzle you.

Speaker 2:          01:05:43       When I was a kid, there were these things that seemed three d when you're standing, it's like a dinosaur was coming out. And like, I'm always fascinated by that because there's something of, I guess what Freud would call the uncanny. There've been moments I've had with psychedelics when I think reality is not what I think it is. And this is just but one bandwidth and talk for a moment of, uh, you know, the, the, of course, we live within a limited spectrum of color. We live within a limited range of sound vibration. Is it a, is it pointless to speculate, but we. There are realms of senses for which we do not have the instruments that we're surrounded by waves and all or his lights and fields for things for which we don't even have the language because we don't have the instruments to receive them.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Well, we could think that, but I actually, I'm, I'm, I'm more intrigued by the idea that, that we're already in receipt of so many sensory inputs that we don't pay attention to it we don't know about, but we're influenced by them. The fact that we are not aware of them doesn't mean they're not shaping our experience conditioning what we're about, but here's another thing that to go back to beauty, which I think links with the political in a way that might interest you. We all operate a kind of everyday aesthetics. We choose which Mug to have in which ball. When we're having our breakfast, we like things arranged a certain way. We will make little efforts to make our surroundings feel more pleasing, happier, and it's, I think, a terrible sign of the poverty of the spirit when people are really crushed when they no longer even do that. So there was a sociologist in Glasgow in the seventies who went and lived in the Gorbals uh, and she had to kind of manufacture an accent so people didn't treat her as an outsider. She wanted to do anthropology, you know, I'll be among the people. Yeah. And I'm going to

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       Okay. So she was able to sort of see roughly fake, but like an anthropologist, I'm going to go and brilliant and she. But she said it always struck me. She said the people I was living amongst who were most deprived didn't even make any effort to make their immediate surroundings prettier or pleasant. Other people, it put a painter Cota and on the door they'd have a plant part outside the window. There are ways in which they just wanted to make their environment a little nicer. And then you saw people who couldn't even do that. They were so broken. They were so crushed. They were so beaten down that even that attempt just to make your immediate surroundings feel more pleasing had gone, so I think that urge to have a little bit of everyday aesthetics to make our surroundings nicer, to make a choice, a choice about what, what, what spoon.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       We'll use what Mug we'll use, what you know, how will we just want things to look on the table. That's very basic about being okay about wellbeing and about humanity and when that goes, we're really in trouble in a few things. I'd like to pick up like a technique for people in addiction for measuring your wellness and sort of a personal wellness index where you can sort of ask yourself a series of questions and give yourself a one to 10 evaluation on how clean is your car at the moment. How well is your diet? How often are you arguing with your spouse? These sort of tiny. When I think myself, there've been times in my life where I would almost eat the cereal out of box. Typically tippecanoe chew now into Udl because I've got. I've got no demonstration of selflessness, no idea of the beauty of the self, you know, the idea of the beauty of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       Yeah. There's, those values have totally broken down. And also I'm Grayson Perry and he's brilliant documentaries about taste and class where he sort of, what he, uh, like he's, I suppose he's thesis was that like are the higher up the class, the less demonstrative class structure that less demonstrative taste was in working class culture, big Larry vehicles with staff on them, jewelry, tatters. And then when you get into the upper class, upper class is sort of everything understated no labels in the middle class. It was a wonderful way of tracking class when, how classes exemplified and further on, tasty sort of showed like there's a clip of warm metal work in men's club, sort of at the front with some kind of a crooner guy and she was all drunk and having a wonderful emotional experience and crying. And he said like, but why do we think of that as somehow sort of vulgar?

Speaker 1:          01:10:21       Whereas a woman generally weeping in a box at lover him, we think of the height of sophistication, who is deciding what is beautiful, who is deciding what is good tastes. Very often it's about distance, isn't it? A lot of people when they consider the high arts at the fine arts, they, they, they, they want to embrace it, but they want a kind of distance from it. So I think our prayers like that. It's so staged. It's so artificial that you know you can exercise those emotions, but only because it's clearly not reality and it's a little bit further away. Whereas the crooner in the club, she's getting very near to kind of affecting you. This is her real life. It's probably some of the sadness in her life that you're immediately hearing and that way in which some people like art to be a safe space to exercise their emotions.

Speaker 1:          01:11:10       As long as there's a bit distant from them, it's not going to. It's not going to be bad to have tragedy. It's not going to be bad to have something side. It's not going to be bad to have something that's kind of powerful. That's also as a skirt. I think I can say that a characteristically English thing to want to do a certain level of society. Yeah, we, we're living, we're aloof. You don't want your feelings and there. I mean, Scott's very funny because they imagine they're full of reason, but they're actually full of passion and you know, they get, they get very wound up and worked up so they feel the strain between those two. But I think, you know, the English often volume, the lack of overt expression of emotions and yet we'll still go to an opera and weep in a, as long as it's in a safe space, as long as it's not, you're not going to have to get up and talk to your neighbor immediately beside you when you were feeling a little raw and emotional.

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       So I think that's right. And I think also that expression of exercising your taste again, um, people with terminal illnesses who've got limited periods of time, they often say they know, pay attention to their everyday experience and to the pattern of it. The texture of it and a new way, you know, they instead of just putting the milk bottle on the table, they'll put it into a jug. They'll want to sort of pour it on the on the cereal. Why make that effort? You might say, you know, you only have to wash out the drug because it makes that particular moment nicer. Brighter. I'm looking after myself. I'm taking care of each of these moments because they're precious and if we had endless amount of time to live, nothing will be precious because we could always do it later. We can always do it at some other moment and I think it's being in the moment, being aware of how you make the immediate environment and the environment of others better. That's the thing that we want to concentrate on. That's the thing that makes me feel good.

Speaker 2:          01:12:56       Live. Yes. To create somehow a kind of art throughout life to be reverential towards beauty, our our own beauty in the beauty of others and that the senses can be instruments for measuring beauty. Not Tools, tools,

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       but ways in which we remediate the beauty in ourselves and others. And actually are really literally in touch with it. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       Literally in touch. This is where the external world is entering our lives through these fields, through the portals. This is where we access. That's very beautiful. Just darkness and possibly a lighter note though, it may not be your like a connoisseur of wine. You must be bloody good at that. Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       God, I always terrified of this question because the one thing that people who are pretty good tasters and pretty knowledge about wine as, they never want to say that they're experts because they're also very easily fooled. It's from Tesco because it's two 99. Oh, I found this delicious tasting a belief in a barrel. That's. I remember. Here's a nice story about, about wine experts that I think is, is better. Uh, I talked to German who was a uh, uh, the world, Somalia. He won the championship world some lea. So there he is looking after people in a restaurant with wines and he said, what do you think you need to be a good Somalia? He said, you probably imagined someone who can taste any wine and tell you immediately where it came from and who's venyard and what year or you think you're someone. It's someone who will tell you, Oh, you know, Sarah Motto, if this is what you're reading, this is what you should drink.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       He said, what you need is humility. You need modesty and humility. He said, because your job is to try to find out what the customer likes and wants and to help them to find something that's right for them and good for them. And he said, and also, you know, every day of the week I'll have to blind taste and I will get a wine wrong. You know, it will make me humble again. Don't make me no. I still don't understand everything about this world of wine. And he talked about having a client who came in to the restaurant, guy knew nothing about wine. Your does a a steak dish. And he picks up the wine list and he goes through it and he finds a dessert wine, Chateau de cam, perhaps one of the world's most expensive, most beautiful wines. But it's a, it's a sweet dessert wine and, and he, he, he either knows the name or he's looking for an expensive wine, so he says, I'll have this, and the smelly lea didn't say, Oh sir, no, you don't have a dessert wine with the state.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       You want something from the Rhone or from Bordeaux and let me find it for instead he came, he went to the sheriff and he came back and he said to the guy, since you're having the Chateau de cam, the chef thought that you might want it with a for grass source. So they had changed the food to make something more acceptable, more suitable to go with the wine he had ordered and he said, and that guy now trusts me and he's learning more and he's becoming quite enthusiastic and you know, he lost my advice and I think that's a lovely story. Didn't humiliate him. He didn't show off. We didn't sort of impose his knowledge. He find out what this guy wanted and what it was about. And then showed him gradually found ways to show how do you match food and wines. And that's what I always want to do, if I'm, if I'm trying to get people interested in wine, I do not want to do that thing that so often we see where someone's standing at the front of the room and they're saying, well, this is a particularly tight knit, Clara it from the left bank.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       I think your show, it's, it's, uh, I think you'll find it's showing a little bit of maturation, you know, very fantastic. And everybody in the room thinks I don't know what he's talking about. I don't get that and I'll never get that. And they feel left out. So instead I think what I always want to do is give people a chance to discover something about themselves while they're having a wine. So the hardest thing people do is, is getting a single glass and you see how is it? And they say, oh, I don't know. I like it, I don't like it. But you see, can you say anymore? No. But now if you give people two glasses of wine, two glasses of different lines, you said try them both. Which do you prefer? I prefer the one on the right. Is it different from the one that left?

Speaker 1:          01:17:19       Yeah. Hi. Different. Oh, well. It's slightly more juicy or fruity or it's slightly more sour or the one is light sour inside. Now they start comparing and now they're beginning to understand something about what's going on in the wine and also something about what's going on in them and I love that because then when they learn about it, they'll go and pass it onto someone else. They'll get someone else to practice and to try this and you say, with our red wine, what do you think of it? Or describe it. They'll say, well, it's fruity and you can say, okay, red fruits are black fruits and that's kind of an easy thing for people to think, is it more blackberry black currant or is it strawberry raspberry? They can do that and now you just give them choices and you get them to explore and either exploring not just the wine. They're exploring their response and reaction to it and you find out what they like and what they don't like and now they can choose better than they can, you know, they can now take an interest, they can go on and exploring for themselves. And that's what I want to do. I want, I want to give people the means to do that

Speaker 2:          01:18:18       quite early in that I realized that I'm an alcoholic. No one do that to take, to take black fruit. Red Fruit actually. Typically, what are you doing? That's fantastic. I think that was a, um, a beautiful analogy for the world of knowledge in general that we have to invite people to have a degree of authority in their experience of sensual world and the philosophical world. And again, only the things that there are words for, uh, being described when you were talking about one there. My wife wrote this brilliant book when we're before our daughter was born and they in this book, it was really excellent skill. It said it gave you the vocabulary for describing the types of sensation you would go through him. Birth. Is it burning? Is it stretching is in actually in sort of when it broke down the pain, it took away works that were very generic and also catastrophic and provided you with a means to articulate what your experience is, you that moment, and I think my wife certainly said it removed much of the fear around that

Speaker 1:          01:19:31       probably became a connoisseur of her own pain. She was interested in it. What was it like? Was it stinging? Was at burning? Was it stretching? Is it pulling in Sun and, and the more she's attending and thinking about the particular texture the last year, just feeling the raw yuck of pain, the more you're able to cope and pain management is often about that. Getting people to actually pay attention to the, you know, the real we've and fabric and texture.

Speaker 2:          01:19:57       Do you think that neurologically that's because moving you to a different part of your consciousness and possibly remove brain and uh, and limiting distractions? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:04       it is, but it's better to do that than just sedate you. Have you kind of comatose.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       I mean, I, I really think pain management is difficult but, but more attention rather than less. And more discrimination rather than less. You'll be able to manage it. Yes. Oh, well, Professor Barry Smith. Thank you so much. That was a really interesting and quite intense journey. I thought. Wide ranging. It was a pleasure.
