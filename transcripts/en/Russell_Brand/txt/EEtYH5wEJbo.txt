Speaker 2:          00:35          The nine

Speaker 1:          00:50          is in all of our social activist and filmmaker known for political analysis and criticism of corporate globalization. Her books include no logo, the shock doctrine, and this changes everything which was a New York Times best seller. She frequently appears on global and national list of top influential thinkers. One occasion higher up than me, which was infuriating and in 2016 was a ward and probably all occasions. That's the only time I've been on the list and in 2016 was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for activism on climate justice. Her new book, which will be talking about in some depth is no, is not enough at MCO. Here is this is a look at how we arrived at this surreal political moment, how to keep it from getting a lot worse and how if we keep our heads, we can flip the script. So primarily in this book, no is not enough.

Speaker 1:          01:35          You're talking about trump and what trump epitomizes and what trump is perhaps a symptom of something that you can pray. See in this new audio form I can try. Um, first of all, it's great to be with you and I should have done some of that. You could. What I'd really love you. I think you're really beautiful person. I think you're a body Sattva to use a Buddhist term, a person that's helping other people to enlightenment perhaps at the expense of our own. What do we want to hear? That's actually, I think the price. Like I say that there's people that could go over if they want it, but they, I know I'll stick around here for a while trying to help other people over. So that's quite a good compliment. I remember with great affection the previous times that we've met the first time when I was in an erratic and metropolitan whirlwind of romance with my future wife and having just in fact interviewed Donald Trump, primarily motivated then by this curious impulse that I had of like, how is this guy so rich when, to me, he seems like he's an idiot.

Speaker 1:          02:34          That's why I couldn't understand it. Of course I understood that someone had given him his money, follow the lead, but then, but meeting him, I kept probing him and thinking, what is it? How have you got this money? What's going on? And that was before he was president. We didn't know that he was merely a man in the ascent at that point. So it seems as good a point as any to launch into your book having complimented you and my gratitude for you coming here and being on our podcast and the niceties that be observed.

Speaker 3:          03:00          So thank you. Um, so look, I, I wanted to just put trump in some kind of context. This is not looking at the psychology. Um, you know, there's, I think a lot out there just about sort of pathologizing him as this extreme, extreme individually and he's certainly an extreme individual, but he's also just a symptom of the culture in so many ways. He is the fulfillment of so many of the most dangerous trends. I'm just the worst, the worst of us really. And there's this way in which he's so bizarre. And so unlike what we're used to from politicians that I think we talk about him as if he's some sort of Martian, you know, what did he do now? Could he really have just tweeted that? I mean, what a like this is this, everyone's, it describes the state they're in as, as shock, but I see it as really, it's more like a cliche.

Speaker 3:          03:52          It's a cliched outcome. Like of course a culture that fetishized as well, that federal Spanish eyes celebrity that fetishize is fakeness. It at every level. You know, if you wrote a science fiction novel about a world in which the United States elected Donald Trump as their president and you handed it to your editor editor would tell you that. It was too cliched and outcome, right? It's too predictable and outcome, and so I think trump is the fulfillment. I think you're right, was thinking about the theatrical term grotesque, grotesque is merely an exaggeration of the ordinary to make it more identifiable and recognizable and these sort of traits were always present under the Bush presidency. Galumphing individualism was president and buccaneer international, like internationalist attitude don't know internationally. Those interventions about. So yeah, the way it's entirely predictable. One of the things that are like a fingerprint or I suppose it's because I have the privilege of a comedic perspective.

Speaker 3:          04:54          He's sort of something about him that's likable comparatively. You know what I feel that it is, is that people got odd on sort of Clintonian Blair, right? You know, at least he's new labor and like this kind of charming, slick, superficial, technocratic, bureaucratic, so vinea of pleasantness, but Marston indifference and ignorance to the needs of the majority of people. That was disingenuous and untruthful and Donald trump may be many things and clearly as your book outlined, he is those things. But what you also seems to be is authentic in a bizarre way. He's not logging. There's something mad about someone's lying, but he, he's telling you the truth about being a liar. It, you know, so he gets caught lying all the time, but he's open about the fact that he's a liar and he's corrupt and he does whatever it takes to win. And so you can't catch them out on anything. And I think that's what people mean when they were like, well, at least he's honest. Like they don't mean he's technically honest. They understand that he lies all the time, tick authentically inauthentic or something like that. Um,

Speaker 1:          05:59          but do you think I'm talking to in a sense, no, me about economy and energy, but even though, I mean to get too hippy dippy here, but like when you, like if you're watching Hillary Clinton talk on television, there's people. If people were in the lead up to that election and then you watched Donald Trump. So there is a, even in the grotesqueness and evidently the content was irrelevant because if someone gets some of the more outrageous things, so you know, the sexiest things, the racist things, if those things are irrelevant, then what? Easier. That's getting traction. What easier that's reaching people. Uh, my idea is that it's authenticity. There's like, well fuck it, you know, sort of think, oh wow, this guy is not Hillary Clinton where Hillary Clinton, most people don't seem to know how to talk like, well you see them and like tim resume talking off the Greenfield. You think this person is almost not a human. They don't. They don't know Jesus. I don't know what we're going to do that. Whereas Donald Trump, when he says, yeah, I was eating chocolate cake. You something. This is bizarre, but there's something about it that's not what I've been used to for the last 24 years. And I can see how people are really disenfranchised and disillusioned might find it appealing.

Speaker 3:          06:59          Well, I think there's also something, you know, Hillary Clinton, Blair, um, you know, these figures are, they are the symbol of the Davos class, like the people up on the mountain top at those already. Well, it's the party that not, I mean, you were invited, but most people were not invited to write that. It's, it's the party of this, this sort of the winners in this, in this global economy have a small group of super winters and, and huge numbers of, of locked out people at the bottom of that mountain. And so I think the data summit became this sort of symbol, and this is why this phrase devost class came a little bit into currency, right? It's this world where you had the politicians hobnobbing with the ceos, the billionaires and then a list celebrities blessing the whole thing. And um, and it was, it was a world that most people had absolutely no access to.

Speaker 3:          07:58          Right? And I think there's something about trump and the way there was a strange kind of generosity to his wealth in that he did invite the world in. Like, I mean, most, most wealthy people in the world right now, the super rich don't want to flaunt their wealth. Like they understand, like Bill Gates doesn't want us to see his, his many mansions and he doesn't know gun curing malaria. He wants us to see his altruism, right? Whereas trump said to the world, like, come into my mansion, right? I'm going to turn it into a reality TV show. Like people were invited into his wealth and there's a way in which I think there, there is a, there was gratitude for that. He, he, um, and I think that that is something of what people mean by authenticity. Authenticity is such a strange word to use to describe this sort of festival of fakeness that is the trump family. Yes. Um, but, you know, and I don't think it is a message that could have sold if the alternative was not Hillary Clinton. I think if Bernie had been running against trump, the absurdity of this, you know, this family that shows in their first televised interview to address Americans on a series of golden thrones, right? Remember that interview that they did. So he loves the goal. He's like a

Speaker 1:          09:23          sofa. Yeah, like an emperor or assaulting. Interestingly, the imagery, the golden in our country, the image of him with Nigel farage and a golden elevate something that became a kind of an emblem, but the but the brazenness seems like an authenticity. How devoid and bereft of hope must we be? How disillusioned and despairing must we have been that people, insignificant numbers of women and people from demographics that you would imagine it would feel particularly offended are like, no, no, no, we prefer that. We prefer that. And I think there's a very, very important lesson for the left in that. And I don't see the left learning.

Speaker 3:          10:05          Well, it depends how you define the left, right? I think there is, I think fairness and sharing kindness. I think there has been a learning. I mean, I. When I look at the Corbyn campaign here and which I think in some ways is a reaction to trumpism, right? I mean this, this completely unfocused, grouped unselect the Anti brand, right? Jeremy Corbyn is, I mean the person who actually started applying the principles of marketing to political parties in a serious way was Tony Blair. I mean he. Well, I mean when I remember when I was writing no logo 20 years ago, it was shocking that there was this politician who used the word branding to describe a political party. I mean the new labour, new labour and, and they, they were rebranding the Labour party, giving it a new name. A new logo was like new coke. Right.

Speaker 3:          11:04          And what I wrote no logo is that Tony Blair's Labour party was like a labor scented party. And, and this was shocking in the 19 nineties that you would sort of apply the techniques used to sell dishwashing liquid liquid and Coca Cola to a political party that he was divorcing this word labor, which traditionally meant working people from, from it was [inaudible] it and just turning it into a brand, pulling it up from its roots. And what I found really moving about about Corbin's campaign, watching it, you know, online, because I wasn't here and particularly the Ken loach a little films right? Was that he put workers for the workers, started in his campaign, just regular working people and indeed public sector workers who have been so steadily vilified over the past 40 years were the stars of his campaign, not him, you know, and then you'd hear be hearing from nurses and pediatricians breaking down crying and teachers just talking about the real impacts of austerity and then you just see the logo labor and it just meant labor, but it wasn't, it just meant workers.

Speaker 3:          12:18          It just meant it meant what it originally meant. And so it sort of felt like, well, I think people are learning the lessons of trump. They might not be learning it in the US yet, but I think I feel like here there was a reaction against this, this fakery. Whereas in the states you have liberals who think that the solution to trump is getting oprah to run against him. I mean, seriously or Mark Zuckerberg get get, get a liberal billionare to run against trump and all will be. Well, if the broader context like, isn't it like, um, I wouldn't Yanis Varoufakis Yanis Varoufakis coming in when he was, he said like, I think Wolfgang Schauble said the democracies. All right. As long as you don't change anything. Right. When you started out saying about Blair in the mentality of branding, he was doing something. Of course it was extremely small in retrospect.

Speaker 3:          13:13          History is totally disgusting. That was a lovely North American reaction to some British coffee I'm supposed to say. I think it's lovely. That's right. But that's a reaction now I winching and recalling in. Hold on, sorry. I just had to do that bitter espresso. I'm sorry. It was just, I felt I needed to super caffeinate myself to your mouth with you. Reach through your ears. I shuttered. It was a shoulder. Can I shops a funny story about that? So I, I, as you can tell, I'm North American and, but I, I did live in this country for, for one year, um, when I was 10 years old and had an absolutely terrible time. And, and I, I, um, went to, uh, we lived in Oxford and I went to a school that I don't think exists anymore called Bishop Kirk. We had that burned down because of you.

Speaker 3:          14:07          But see what North American kids do to bond is like the easiest way that you can make friends as a kid in North America is to trash the food, you know, at the school cafeteria or, or it's summer camera, whatever it is. That's, that's how, that's one of the ways you, you bond. And so my first, yeah, uh, we, we went to the cafeteria and they gave us some terrible food and they, I remember that, that the pictures of custard, which was a new phenomenon to me, pewter pitchers of custard and I sat down at the table of my new would be friends at age at, I think I was nine at this point, not yet 10. And I said, this is disgusting. A little girl named Katie Bennett, who was the vicar's daughter,

Speaker 1:          14:52          looked up and said, I think it's lovely. That's when I realized I wouldn't have no British friends even when you had been raised by wolves. Definitely, yeah. As you criticized our pitchers of custard, our listeners, we're off to voting booths and ticking the box. Mark the UKIP. They're lovely. Lovely. I can have a sip of this coffee again and then say it. Nicer reaction.

Speaker 1:          15:17          I think it's a lovely well done, but that was a little bit of a swallow that looked like you were disgusted. Naomi Klein, so you were there very much like the little boy, the emperor's new clothes you wear. The little girl that pointed out that the custard was actually disgusting. Now I remember reading in, I read no logo when it was the coolest book to read at the time and I was a heroin addict at that time, so some of the more dense passages were tricky and I was already in Cuba while making, as I'm sure I've told you, a chewing gum commercial, so it was felt somewhat conflicted. I was in a really no logo which had been reading before I left. I was reading it. I was making a chewing gum commercial, the most vacuous of all products, of course, unnecessary mimicking of mastication while the world staffs and I was in Cuba where unlike a sort of where there was the experiment of socialism was sort of withering before the eyes, but still something very beautiful and incredible and you I suppose in that book, No logo, bringing capitalism to Cuba personally.

Speaker 1:          16:16          I've personally doing my level best. I was like an agent in a sense to try to try to get naked. Come on guys, give it a go. It's not that bad. They in my fraternity in solidarity, get that mural down. Have you tried to delicious coke my shop. I'm like, try this Bacardi. You'll love it. It is an insult. Now tap. I'm like, it's like when you talk there about Tony Blair coopting the language of branding and consumerism going and applying it in a political sphere. Isn't it almost like that the political sphere is an enclave within the uber context of consumerism and capitalism, so of course that language is going to have a greater efficacy than a sort of a particular topical political language and ideology because we're not living in a political culture. We are living in a consumer culture, so that language, those images, that kind, that kind of discourse is going to be more effective because we don't, we all agree now the other than sort of like, uh, like in the last election in this country is cause for optimism in a sense because you sort of think, oh, people who vote in our kind of kindness and people have had enough and people are sick of the old models, but you know, ultimately things are continuing in the same way, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          17:27          Because what we're really, we live in a consumer culture as opposed to a democratic culture. I just wonder if it isn't cyclical like Wah Wah, whether we've just maxed out on. I mean, this is way I hope. I hope that Donald Trump is as far as

Speaker 3:          17:50          we're going to take this extraordinary experiment of, of, of selling absolutely everything in life, a corporatizing, every bit of the comments, every bit of public space and yes, then applying the treating politics as if it is a corporation and applying the rules of marketing and branding to politics is a natural extension of that. But I think, I think it's changing and I think there is room for a, another kind of another kind of political project. I always felt when I was writing no logo, that there was something inherently hopeful in the fact that companies like Nike and starbucks and apple were using ideas like revolution, community transcendence to sell consumer products that could never deliver these things. Right. Um, and the fact that this started to happen at the height of the neoliberal period at the, you know, at, at the, at the fulfillment of the Reagan Thatcher Project, I mean this is when it up to the eighties, the model was, you know, you make a product a and as a corporation you are in the business of making products and selling those products.

Speaker 3:          19:07          And you would then slap a logo on it to differentiate it from other products in the marketplace and buy advertisements and tell people about it. But what changed in the nineties is that these companies, and this is what no logo is about, is what the meaning of this flip of, of companies like Nike emerging and saying, well, actually, we're not a shoe company. We're not a what, you know, we're not a trainer company. We are about the idea of transcendence through sports, right? We are about the idea of you being your best of, uh, of, uh, of any kind of, uh, you know, being your best. Just do it. That's what, that's what it was about. Starbucks announced that the meaning of their brand was the third place, not home, not work, but community, a place where we gather, right? And this was the period where apple started using the iconography of every revolutionary movement and Gandhi, Martin Luther King.

Speaker 3:          20:00          Um, you know, as an, it just said, think different, right? And these huge billboards. So, I mean, on the one hand you can wring your hands and say, oh, they're coopting all of our ideas. Right? But I always found it quite hopeful because with all the best market research, what they were finding was that we wanted more than just trainers and laptops and, and lattes and for capitalism, this is a great recipe because it keeps you shopping because as soon as you, um, you know, as soon as you unwrap this new thing that was supposed to bring you community and revolution, you're immediately dissatisfied and have to shop some more. So that's great for an economic system built on growth. But it does mean that that part of ourselves that longs to be part of something bigger than just our atomized existence and shopping is parental perennially unfulfilled.

Speaker 3:          20:49          So for, for, for me as a political animal, I always thought, well, we should thank them. They've done our market research for us. Um, and so it is the role of social movements to rebuild a, uh, uh, opportunities for people to actually get real community, right? Because it's not a coincidence that these companies started selling these ideas. At the very moment when every public institution, um, every, every place where we used to get that sense of belonging, whether it was organized religion, you know, whether it was the public square, all of this is being eroded. So now we're going, we're, we're getting it in a temporary state through shopping. Um, but you know, I think we are at a moment where we're starting to see signs that we're actually getting it from rebuilding our sense of community and belonging.

Speaker 1:          21:42          No. If the accompanying component, all of the advent of capitalism, some grotesque, a Uber instantiation of which we are currently uber the car that really now the, the, the, they have now the, those synonyms have dovetailed. So this sort of Uber version we labor beneath the, the, the, uh, the accompanying idea of socialism has possibly be. I think it'd been discredited because I don't think you can, like, you know, when you look at sort of perhaps British socialism, which is the famous people famously, there's as much to methodism as marks one recognizes that there's not the soul. There is not just one epistemology for the idea of fairness and kindness. There is not just one lineage, not just one room, but what I feel is that battle has been won and I retro spective, resurrection of those old ideas will not be fulfilling, but precisely the phenomena that you speak of when you say, oh, there's this perennial yearning for belonging now that can be co opted by. Capitalism can be co opted by, consumerism that you can attach the idea of, I want this new phone to the I am an individual. I am free. You can. What is the indigenous feeling and how can the indigenous feeling be properly utilized? I don't think by mechanistic or materialistic idea when we are dealing, I think with metaphysics, when we're dealing in fact with the human spirit, when we're dealing with something, even when spoken of in secular terms, that is a my view, undeniably a spiritual idea,

Speaker 3:          23:26          but it's also a scientific idea. I mean the reality of interconnection, the reality that we are not atomized individual, that we are exist within webs of connection with other human beings and with the natural world. We exist in relationships of dependence and interdependence. How do you mean by that? Do you mean by that knowing that we can't exist without clean water, we can't exist without healthy soil. We can't exist without an atmosphere that creates a bubble that is safe for, for, for humanity, and that it's a very fragile state. Right? So we can tell ourselves a narrative, and we talked about this last time, right? I mean the narrative that we have been telling ourselves since the dawn of the scientific revolution, which is a narrative of dominance and apartness from nature that's in the, in the span of human history began with agriculture or industry.

Speaker 3:          24:21          Did you just say, um, I said scientific revolution, but I mean, I think it's an interplay between three forces. One is Judeo Christianity and, and the scientific revolution and all kinds of new, uh, ideas that put humans on a sort of ego trip and imagining that all would be known one day. And then key technologies that actually seemed to make the dream of domination real and the key technology and all of that was the steam engine where you can tell yourself a story about who you're going to dominate nature all you want. But until the steam engine, that's a fantasy because you can only sell your ships when the wind blows. You are in a relationship, a dialogue with the natural world. You need wind in order to sale. You can tell yourself a story, uh, uh, of dominance, um, about your, your, your, your, your factory.

Speaker 3:          25:19          But the fact is before the steam engine, you needed rushing water. You need a water, a water wheel that, that, that needed the water at a certain level, right? So there was a negotiation with the natural world. And I think the power of the steam engine, um, was this idea that now you really are God. Human beings really are God in that you can sell your ships whenever you want. You are the boss of nature. And this is the way the steam engine would market it. And so I think it was, I think you had, was it, you'll now I'll pull to try and know about kind of thing about power and autonomy that you, you are now the boss of the natural world and also more of a boss of your workers because when your factories are immobile, we mean you can build them wherever because you have portable energy, you're not, you don't build it where, where the, where the water is and then you're kind of captive to your workers.

Speaker 3:          26:10          You can, uh, you can be more abusive boss. You can go where, where there's a surplus of labor and you know, a lot of what I'm talking about comes from some terrific research by a Swedish historian named Andreas mom. Um, so I think, I think it was a gradual process where you had the ideas but the ideas weren't real until you had the technology. But now we're in this era where it turns out we were never the boss. I mean, this is why I believe climate change is a spiritual crisis and a narrative crisis as well as an ecological crisis. Because what the natural world is telling us, you know, when asphalt

Speaker 3:          26:44          is melting and Cambridge in Arizona this summer, um, and when Goldman Sachs is buffeted by Super Storm Sandy is, you will, you are not the boss. Every action has a reaction. You are still in dialogue with the natural world. Timeframe is altered. Exactly. So it was not, there was, there was about 200 years where we could tell ourselves this narrative of apartness and separate NASPA. But this is why I say it's, it's not just, it's not just a spiritual story. And I think the reason why civilizations understood this for so long is because they were living at relationships of interdependence with nature. Yes.

Speaker 1:          27:20          And a lot of that folk mythology and a sort of a early pre monotheistic religion contained within it. The ideas that we are rediscovering and indeed rebranding as scientific discoveries. They were already there. They were already present. People talk of mindfulness now is like, oh, it turns out that mindfulness does really help high heart disease, but if you can just extract it from all this Mumbo jumbo about one living consciousness manifesting itself on the material plane or in a rather more potent and shorter three letter words and I think that is very difficult to introduce a narrative that will supersede the narrative that you articulated in no logo and subsequently described the mutations in much of your later work without a story that has I more vital visceral, deeper, ancient, potent human truth about one Sun God and the nature of consciousness and the true nature of interconnectivity and I think that the response to sort of the this was that knows anything.

Speaker 1:          28:31          The deer of capitalism has got to be a similarly potent and motivating idea and your point that the fact that apple and Nike have to refer to in order to motivate people to buy unnecessary and in some cases brilliant trainers is is a reference to oneness. God's community profits with a Ph in that for me is will. We have to go back to that source. The answer is not, you know, like for me like, and I know next to nothing about Marxism, but it was the thing that sort of comes up a lot in this podcast. Perhaps it's good to, I keep saying it, but when mark talks about alienation, when he's talking about the spiritual problem of a mechanized and fully industrialized culture that is not controlled by its labor force, that it's just that in itself is a problem of the spirit and the, my personal frustration around the opponents of, you know, sort of like the, the sort of, the lighter side of the neoliberal project is unwilling to not backtrack but to embrace the spiritual side of this because the new age stuff sounds to me a bit sort of God, not back crap, but like, you know, but to recognize that there is room in this discourse for what is this, what it, that we're fighting for?

Speaker 1:          29:42          Why is it, why did it matter that we're human beings? Why does it matter that human beings in the planet is in trouble? Who Cares? How do we avert avoid nihilism unless it's with some deeper spiritual truth?

Speaker 3:          29:59          Well, I mean, I think there's a, there's a little bit of a difference in North America than here because of the role of indigenous leadership in progressive movements, particularly in the climate movement and in the environmental movement. I mean, every single major battleground against a new mine, against a nuclear waste dump against a new pipeline is a fight that has indigenous people at the forefront. Um, whether this is true in, in Canada where I live, it's true in the United States. Uh, it's true in Australia and New Zealand. Um, and, and in most parts of the world, um, it's true in India. That's true all over Latin America and you know, there are. And so what's been interesting to me as somebody who, you know, I, I come more from the economic side of the left, Tino, my early writing was all focused on labor and human rights, less, less so the environment.

Speaker 3:          31:07          But for the past decade or so, I've been very immersed in, in the climate movement, which I think is deeply interconnected with all of those other issues. And I find it really exciting to watch the ways in which settler movements, movements of, of nonindigenous people are being impacted by exposure to an indigenous worldview that has the oneness that you're describing at its center, right? Um, you know, if you're fighting a pipeline at standing rock, you are fighting that pipeline according to the rules of the community there. And they have the rules up, uh, you know, on the side of the various structures in the camp that say you are in ceremony. This is not, we are not protested. We are protectors. We're water protectors, meaning we are protecting living systems that protect all of life. And when we march up to the police sign, that is an act of ceremony that is not an act of protest.

Speaker 3:          32:13          Right? Um, and it's, um, and, and it creates, you know, one of the interesting conversations I had at standing rock and every chapter, but this in the book, but I didn't describe this, um, conversation. There was a, a guy of a poet who I ran into there and he'd been in many different left spaces, protest spaces. And he was just talking about how different this was, and one of things he said was really different was that he said, every movement that I've been a part of has fetishized use and this, this idea of just sort of perennially starting over and just kind of hating old people. Whereas this is a culture that respects wisdom, hard won wisdom of elders, not to say all older people are right, but that there was, it was a deeply intergenerational movement that, that young people were at the forefront, but elders were, were, were teachers and leaders as well.

Speaker 3:          33:12          Um, and it's just one of the ways that I think the culture of the left is slowly changing. I think that's really important. What you just said. I don't have a hood that before I was aware that the, a pipeline, a ceremony ceremony instead of protest and immediately you, her, instead of protests, protests, that's really good because you're denying the conventional lexicon, which is what frames is. You'll just protesting against this natural progressive thing that's supposed to be happening rather than we'll protecting. Yeah, you're coming from a place of love. You're coming from a place of love for this land, for these living systems that no one can do without. And um, and, and yes, in order to do that, you have to be against something. You have to be against this pipeline that is threatening the only source of drinking water for this community.

Speaker 3:          34:06          But it's not driven. It's a, it's a, it's a sort of a constant reminder that it isn't hate that is dry. It doesn't, hatred of these oil companies are, although, although there's anger there and, you know, and there was opposition there, um, but the but it, but it's serving this broader love. And, and, and this is one of the things that, you know, people ask me stuff, how do you, how do you stay hopeful and all of this in the movement. And I think the reason why that question comes up so much is because so many people who are in spaces of opposition or kind of pickled in anti, you know, in, in that space for understandable reasons, right? But in these, her frontline environmental battles, they really are so often about communities falling more deeply in love with the place, you know, with, you know, maybe it's their coast, um, you know, understanding how dependent they are on the streams and, and, and oceans that surround them. And, and learning about the interdependence that was always there before, but which we were ignored in our little bubbles. So the contingent of the culture that has become prevalent that we live in the from dislocation is a dominant idea that you have no integral relationship to your land. You don't mind, is distinct and superior to environment. It is a resource for us to be used for us to use, uh, the challenge of, again, if these ideas are stitched into ancient

Speaker 1:          35:38          cultures, what else is there in there that we are the gate in? What else in there are we neglecting wherever it's, oh, mindfulness is good for your heart or we are one with our environment or the shape, uh, the, uh, gay in marginalizing and humiliation of the Shaman by the settler cultures. When hunter gatherer of packs were wrangled, coiled and dis empowered. So that cultures could be grounded so that the earth could be subjugated and our ability to live between realms, to imagine new societies, new ways of being like even by rejecting the language, drumming up,

Speaker 3:          36:18          drumming, dancing, these were all banned for indigenous indigenous drumming. Got Rid of all

Speaker 1:          36:24          their ceremony, their music, which yeah, kill the culture. And it's happened again and again. And who did we do it to? The British bright. Basically everyone that we, the ones doing it. Actually Irish dumped by my. That was, I just got. We were trying to artist. What about those lovely trains we give to the people of India? They loved those trains come on. And as a child, what about culture? Try and look at the tray about fish. Newt. Well, if they're everywhere they'll be on the train. Stop Moaning. Yeah. It's uh, it's um, I think this is important. No, me and I don't know quite how to make such a potent idea. Palatable to secularized people without making it sound a bit crap and Hesi and don't do what you're trying. I really am trying to bring some of the glory of God back into this, a bit of fuel area, bit of righteousness, a bit of power, a bit of archangel energy, some flaming swords, but like, you know, like nondenominational, of course.

Speaker 1:          37:19          I mean I feel like every culture in the world should find what connects them to the land, connects them to the one that's connects them to one another. And also I feel like I have to make it bureaucratic and political for a moment. Why the hell not that. How is any sort of centralized system, any post Westphalian clap trap about nations ever going to work when people can't be tied up in a Daf flag anymore. It's too bigger idea served its function. Nationalisms broke globalization of the type that we've had so far hasn't Balderdash and has led to this reemergence, hasn't it? Of um, trumpkins Pumpkin as I like to call him.

Speaker 3:          37:51          Well, I mean this is, this is, I mean we have to figure it out in a, in a big hurry because we, you know, the climate clock has striking midnight. We don't have a lot of time to, to have a wakeup call. It's interesting, you know, when I was writing my previous book, this changes everything. I mean, my working title for that book was the message, um, because told you not to do that. The problem is when you, when you search on the message, you just get all this Bible stuff, you know, I mean it's just, it's just really creepy. Um, but, but the idea, the message, but the message was going to be here. Homework was going to be messages that climate change isn't an issue. It's a message that is speaking to us in the language of floods and fires and storms and it's telling us to wake up and it's telling us to evolve and it's telling us that this system is broken.

Speaker 3:          38:48          Right? And I think we are in this, at this moment of overlapping system failure. Uh, I think inequality is, is an extraordinarily. It just completely untenable levels. I think thousands of people drowning in the Mediterranean is also a message that this is completely untenable. I think grenfell tower is a message and people are. I think if there's some hope, maybe it's that people are understanding more and more these crises are messages of system failure as soon as that fire happened, right? I mean, it was, it was understood as being so far beyond this one building, but an expression of all of these failed ideas, right? Um, and this and this failed worldview and the cruelty at the, at the center of it. Um, so people are getting that in an instant now. Right? So I think, I think there, I think that it is possible to have kind of punctuated transformation, these moments where suddenly things start changing very quickly.

Speaker 3:          39:52          Um, and you know, if we look at moments where there has been a radical progressive change, it does tend to happen all at once. Does it? When did it? Well, um, you know, in, after the, in the midst of the Great Depression after World War II, after depression, do suppression, new deal, social security, um, after the second world war, public health care and yet, um, and, and then the environmental law laws, the legal infrastructure protecting endangered species. I mean this, this happened one like, like just a flurry of laws, the things with big responses to like everyone's fogged out, you know what I mean? Lots of luck. I don't know much about what happened in the Great Depression, but then you think there was a huge number of people like, oh, we better start now because there's too many of them on my off the Second World War. Oh, we've just killed millions of people.

Speaker 3:          40:50          We better do something. So it's like these things are like isn't in a way while suicide, numerous positive benefits, just a way of power maintain in itself like centralized power going, well this is the bare minimum we can do the bare minimum we can do. There's just got a bit higher for a moment they're going to need to help service. But after that we can probably carry on doing what we're doing, isn't it? What we actually need is a massive deconstruction of power. Like isn't it like anything that. Wouldn't it be good to have some big jazzy global campaigns? I'm a very visually effective and potent. Like we are going to destroy apple logo, that kind of thing. Like we're going to take one big corporation and we organize a global movement, destroy. It probably sounds a bit less popular and brilliant products got off that phone or gm or something where you can say like that thing

Speaker 1:          41:34          that's digital, you know, so fruit globalize, attacking of the brand, protesting, like just to demonstrate, but at the same way like to demonstrate the potency of mobilization, to take one, one victory to one symbol, one thing go right. Why don't we attack that thing? That was the plot of the TV show. What was that hacker show? Russell branch. Was it what Mr. Mr. Robot. Mr Roberts said what happened? Did it go well for Mr. Robot was the second series of Mr. Robot, get back to me. Tell me if the revolutionary idea of bringing down one massive bluechip corporation works. Not Easy. A good idea, Naomi.

Speaker 3:          42:18          I mean I was interested in your conversation with geodes about just, you know, where is the power and the being in these rooms filled with supposedly powerful people in the power isn't there, you know? And, and yeah, I think if, if people could see a deconstruction of one of these symbols of what he calls the deep state, it, it could be quite empowering. But I also think it can, I think this spell of powerlessness, I mean this, this extreme era of corporate power that, that, that in most parts of the world is called Neo liberalism. I mean, that really is dying. And, and,

Speaker 1:          42:59          or is it mutating, do you think? How do, what do you, what evidence is there a bit dying?

Speaker 3:          43:03          Uh, it's, it's, it's a Zombie ideology because as it advanced, this was it. This was a project of ideas that had true believers that would sit down and earnestly tell you that if we privatized, you know, the, the rails for energy and water, good things will happen, right? They will work better, they will be cheaper. I mean, there aren't, there's nobody left to defend deregulation, privatization, low taxes and cuts to social spending. It's, it's stumbling around. And I think you accurately described as kind of a Zombie ideology, right? Because it has its own momentum. But this is why we're in this very dangerous moment because there is a vacuum of ideas and these very dangerous, right wing white supremacist type or misogynist ideas are surging represented by the donald trumps of the world. And the meeting the pens, there's enough of them. Or is it because we live in bubbles all day?

Speaker 3:          43:59          All I'd ever meet him. I never made people who actually sincerely go. Now he's a that Donald Trump. I never meet them or they just say, don't say out loud. What's going on? Well, they're, they're out there. They're out there in the voting. Well, I mean, I think the forces that he's tapping into never went away. He didn't create it, right? Um, but, but this vacuum is potent. It's dangerous, but it also is filled with possibilities. And um, and so, and I feel like it's this very slow decomposition, this slow and the part of the neoliberal project that is slowest to die is not the policies we can. I mean, look, I was on the BBC this morning. We were talking about the fact that the Tory government here is talking about abolishing tuition fees. I mean, there's nobody left to defend austerity, but the. I think the, it turns out that the piece of it that was sturdiest was there is no alternative, right?

Speaker 3:          45:00          More on the imagination is what outlasted the policies themselves and that's what starting to lift because you have this whole generation of young people who didn't get the indoctrination that you got and that I got because their whole adult life is post 2008 financial crisis when all the true believers fled for the hills. They are still trying to oppose brutal imposed brutal austerity on Greece and Spain. But there's nobody out there saying this is going to be good and don't you dare think anything else. Right? So they're free. They're much freer than we were. They never got the hard sell on resentment and I think I'll give him a bit of an indoctrinating myself. No, I mean, what do you mean by the inner trump? What do you mean by the trump within?

Speaker 3:          45:48          Well, I mean this comes back to, you know, this idea of treating trump as totally other. And when I, when I first started working on this book, I just happened, I was at a literary festival and they seated me next to a real Hillary Clinton Democrat. Um, and, and I explained the book I was working on and you know, trump as sort of the, the logical conclusion of all of these trends. And she was sort of nodding along and then I, you know, I said, you know, this is, this is, these are American trans. And she was like, no, it's not like we're Obama, you know, and she wanted to just completely disavow trump, you know, that he was, it was only red states. It was only the, right. It had nothing to do with the broader, the, sorry, the broader culture. Um, so I just don't buy it. I mean, I just see him as just this manifestation of everything that is going wrong in our culture. Just this for our fractured attention span. The fact that he doesn't read just the word, give it to me in a list. You know, Alyssa is what he's, he's, he's a good. Is growing punishment. Make another list. That'll be a good experiment. Well, uh, don't do things that run shorter list 30 things that room

Speaker 1:          47:17          that is fascinating, but he is symptomatic or not that because how could it be otherwise? I mean like what people's unwillingness through revise the Obama presidency because not now obviously comparatively, superficially, personally, he seems like some sort of gorgeous Christ. But actually what he was doing was laying the foundations for what happened subsequently because you can't ask trump if what happened before it was nice.

Speaker 3:          47:43          Oh, and you know, I think with the, part of the, part of my argument that is, is most uncomfortable for American liberals is, is the argument that I don't think we could have trump without Bill Clinton and bill gates because the, those two men more than any others fostered this idea that billionaires are gonna save us, right? We don't have billionaires are countries doing it. Richard Branson, he was going to fix climate change right in his spare time. And um, and Bill Gates is going to fix malaria and we don't need, you know, he had bill gates now has more power than the World Health Organization.

Speaker 1:          48:22          No, me, I went to this island, Richard Branson's island, right. You owned it. It was in the British Virgin Islands. It was a tax haven and on it there was a symposium being held that was about how are we going to make the world a better place and one of the things I said so while on the island and which expediated by hasty departure by teddy atlas, lower like one. This is a tax haven in it. Why don't we just live like operate within the. Even the existing systems will be slightly better than this one and my friend actually said like during the eighties when everything was whoosh crash, Bang, Wallop, Richard Branson was bombing about not air balloons and speed boats and everyone's shitting themselves. He's like, I don't know, perhaps we should legalize drugs and you know, have a sort of a bit more concerned for the environment, which is again an attempt to rebrand, cooperate and appropriate the conscious energies of an awakening people, but of course trump is intimately connected to a Bama, to Bill Gates to Bill Clinton because it is one interconnected system that's feeding off itself.

Speaker 1:          49:28          Now the other risk we have is getting like, you know, wandering into what our call with love and affection, the ICC paddock, where David Eick, we're like, like were sort of like if you've talked to much about sort of interconnected global systems that feed each other, hold each other together, have operated for a long time. People's, let's go, hang on a second. This is a big crack pot. So I'm very much value research based, empirical, secular sounding data because I think it's vital to be taken seriously, but somehow there has to be a marriage between this sort of, this academic data based researched proper academic staff and the power of interconnection with people, the ability to stir viscerally human beings, to make them die, live, love, sacrifice, which they're not going to do for academia.

Speaker 3:          50:22          I think you, I think you're right. I think you're right. And, and I, we live in a beautiful moment where these words worlds are converging. Uh, and you know, I think that what we're learning from science is intensely beautiful and spiritual. We talk about it as if it's something dry and remote. Um, but this is the study of life. Yes,

Speaker 1:          50:47          but because I suppose that that in itself got colonized. The idea of scientific, uh, endeavor became mechanized. The way that's the most research is funded is like, if you look at the, where the funding comes from, who's, who does the grail serve, who does the grail serve Naomi. Now my producer, he's not my producer. He's a free independent human being who happens to be producing this show is holding up a bit of paper that says No. Basically whiteboard says change. Or I come a normally we can do this together. Resistance, black lives matter, recapturing the imagination. And if he's not, imagination isn't recaptured by my religious ranting. I thought that was wrong with him and Naomi's leap manifesto that's covered these topics before you go off to your next appointment, probably the mainstream media little snip your words of wisdom into some actually meeting with some black lives matter activists about Grenville Tower. Oh yeah. This is my cell out appointment of the day. This and that. It's not true with an entered Martin this morning. There you go right there. So it's in a way you're creating steadily more authentic, you know, you to talk to other black lives matter, you're gonna have to commune with pure consciousness.

Speaker 3:          51:56          No, I, I, I, I think what that is a reference to as a section in the book about the fact that social movements really are recovering the utopian imagination, really dreaming and public, not just being an opposition. And one of them most inspiring examples of this is the movement for black lives and in the, in the United States, which came up with this policy platform called the vision for black lives, which is, it's a, it's a political platform without a political party. It's, it came out about through a very participatory grassroots process. It is the, it is a response not only to police violence though though it is that it covers everything from abolishing prisons, the war on drugs, restructuring the tax system, reparations for slavery. And it's very, very bold. And this is what we haven't seen from progressive movements is coming together and saying, well, what, what does the world look like after we win a vision?

Speaker 3:          53:01          Um, and this is why I say the last piece of the neoliberal project to die is this war on the imagination and the, the leap manifesto is it is a project that I've been involved in in Canada, which was an attempt to do this a couple of years ago. We helped host a meeting of 60 movement organizers from a broad cross section of movements, indigenous rights, food justice, climate, labor, uh, some, some faith organizations coming together and just trying to agree on the yes. And, and, and what was so interesting about that at meeting was just how hard it was to be honest. You know, that that muscle, we didn't have a muscle memory of agreeing on what we want. We had a memory of coming together to oppose things. We'd come together to say we don't want this free trade deal. We hate this politician.

Speaker 3:          53:51          We don't want this austerity bill. Um, but we did not have experience of like, well, what does it look like when we win? What is, what do we, what do we agree on about what the world should look like in the future? And one of the things that we had to do was not rely on some easy nostalgia of just like this idea that everything was great in the 19 seventies because the indigenous people in the room and the people representing immigrant organizations in the room, we're just having none of that. Like we're not romanticizing the seventies. So we're going to have to gain our left movements have done that for far too long. Right? So we're going to have to be inspired by a world we haven't seen yet. We haven't created yet. Um, so yeah, if people are interested they can go to the leap.org. I'm interested and I'm a people and I include the whole manifesto at the, at the end of the book too. It's not long, it's 1400 words. If people are rewriting it, that some people are using it to run slates of candidates to take over. City Council will use that. And it's just, you're not waiting for a politician to come along and figure all this out because I think we are in a moment where people are maybe a little vulnerable to save yours. And a lot of trouble because, let me tell you this,

Speaker 1:          55:07          but by the way, my joke about your Messiah tour is not finished. It's a long shot. It's people like you who I worry about. I don't know. That's a bit of archive that's going to get pulled up in 20 years. Here's Naomi Klein is fueled in a brand archive is a. don't call me that in public. No, sorry. So okay. I think the main things I've learned from this conversation and really, really enjoyed was allowed to miss him. I lot the idea that we got the twitching Zombie corpse of capitalism lunging about now lashing about all baffled and confused and bereft of ideas that there's a necessity for New Vision. And I think that we got from Naomi client and what you were saying about like some of those protests we have indigenous people is a reimagining of interconnectivity and oneness, which previously has been regarded. The terrain of what I noticed you call faith organizations. I think more of them kind of summarize where people diverse people to come up with an opposing on subsequent vision. He's a real powerful. I like that and we're going to look at leap dot Org and learn more to see if people can run that. Watch out for. Don't follow leaders. Watch your pocket. Me Watch out for Messiah Masonic figures that some of the other things we've learned as well. Is it?

Speaker 3:          56:19          Yep. I'd have free people like don't point

Speaker 1:          56:24          is rude to point and say you enjoyed that big bucket of customers. Just stop complaining. Naomi about Britain. We've opened our doors to you. We've shared. Knew nothing but love. That's Naomi Klein there. Thank you for being such a wonderful guest as always. Thank you. So that was fun. That show was sponsored by me and my rebirth to the next couple of shows. As I've said, it's sold out, but if you want to go and see me and grim. Oh, on the 10th of July or Richmond in the 17th of July layer. Cambridge. I ain't for July 25th of July. Can Go Russell brand.com. Get tickets. If you liked this show, subscribe and review it. If you tell him just um, well listen to this one. In the end. I mean, you must like it. Stop torturing yourself. Okay.
