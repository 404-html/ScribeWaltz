Speaker 1:          00:00:01       You are listening to under the skin with Russell brand. Today I'll be speaking to rupert sheldrake. Rupert sheldrake is a biologist who's been called the most controversial scientist on, uh, his research strongly challenges the paradigms of conventional science. And he's the author of multiple scientific papers and 10 science books, many of which have been best sellers worldwide, which developers hypotheses that traditional science has difficulty explaining, such as he's popular theory, morphic resonance. It lives in London with his wife, Jill, and they have two sons. He's latest book science and spiritual practice is out now I'm holding a copy of it in my hands. I'm looking at Rupert Sheldrake, who's been, we've been in the studio and matter of minutes, you've challenged the setup of the studio many ways, the positioning of the microphone, the positioning of the camera. It seems to me that you are a man who continually flies in the face of convention.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Have you always been like this rupert? Um, well not completely, no, but I have always heard her kind of contrarian streak, I suppose. How were your, was your, your early experience, your early professional life was conventional academia? It's that, right? You were like uh, Oxford researcher or dawn dawn at Cambridge. I did a phd at Cambridge knows that Donna. Yes, I and a sort of a, I suppose a conventional biologist. Well I was doing unconventional sounds under the guise of a conventional academic appointment as a research fellow. So um, I was actually, when I was at Cambridge I was trying to see how we could expand the frontiers of biology go beyond the framework of thinking. But at that stage I hadn't published clarity as on morphic resonance and what I did was relatively within the limits of acceptable science. It's interesting the Dogma and doctrine that it exists within the scientific and academic communities and yours is an interview that I feel that at the front of obligated to say that your controversy is that I think that people like on the sort of I posing side of the argument kind of regard you as like, cause I'm interested, very interested in spirituality.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       I'm very interested in science. But what you've already said about challenging frameworks is where my particular academic interest lies. I know there's much about convention that I've have to learn. Of course I do like most people, but I'm very interested in pushing frontiers and boundaries. But like there's some of the criticism, oh yeah, that's it. Like, but what you're accused of is like pseudo science and stuff that's not backed up by proper evidence. And I feel like that if we had neil degrasse Tyson on, and I hope we do one day or when I've had people I had on a sort of a, uh, the head of philosophy once from Oxford, he was like a Christian theologian. And it's interesting, isn't it? Because once you're dealing with mysticism, which Christianity must be referred to as to a degree like that, there's a kind of, there's a hierarchy and there's hedge money within those fields. Why are you controversial? What is it the have said that makes people think

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       of you? Is that a phrase that I particularly hated them sometimes if anybody, Woo Woo Frou Frou band Ted talk. You've got banned Ted talk, that elite club, which I think is somewhat admirable. Tell me like what your detractors say of you. If you don't mind? Well, first I have to say why they think it's heretical. Um, what I'm doing fundamentally is challenging the materialist model of reality, which sounds his based on has been for more than a hundred years, which is the doctrine that all matters unconscious. The whole universe is made of unconscious matter. Um, which then leaves the problem. How come we are conscious? And that's called the hard problem. The most scientists assume that consciousness exists only in human brains and possibly in animal brains to um, you know, the liberal ones. So maybe as far down as worms or something, but, um, anyway, it's all only in brains and the rest of the universities unconscious, purposeless going nowhere.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       Evolution is just a matter of blown churns. There's no god out there. There's no spirit heart there. There's no creativity out there is dry. It's just chance. Um, and that because they believe are mindset, nothing but our brains, then anything that suggests the mind extends further than the brain must be pseudo scientific. So for example, I've done a lot of research on telepathy, um, where people, and indeed dogs. I wrote a whole book on dog to and animal telepathy called dogs that know when their owners are coming home. Um, based on evidence that dogs can tell when their owners are coming home. Millions of people have had this experience. I've done experiments and sure enough, at least some dogs really can know when people come at random times and unfamiliar vehicles we film at All. We have all this objective evidence. But the very, the very fact that I'm suggesting to laugh with you might be real is something that provokes this kind of hysterical response that it must be we were pseudoscience because my opponents believe it's impossible.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       So they don't think they need to look at the evidence. So you think it's impossible, therefore this stuff must be fake or phony or fraudulent. Um, and what I do is start from the position that these things seem to happen. Millions of people with dogs have notice their dogs or cats pick up their thoughts, millions of people who've had the experience of thinking of some who then rings on the phone, telephone, telepathy. And I've done experiments to show it's not just chance. It's not just guessing. Um, so anyway, these are the kinds of, what do you think that let's say, hey cause you know like listen to me, I'm all about God and consciousness and changing the world and a model that expands beyond material is, and this is where my particular fascination light, but wouldn't they say that those, firstly, those examples about, you know, cats and dogs, they seem sort of somehow hum drum and every day they seem anecdotal and w and wouldn't they say members of the mainstream scientific community know we've done tests around that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:05       It's down to random chance dogs don't know when their owners are coming home. We've can demonstrate this in scientific laboratory conditions, double blind testing, et cetera. I wouldn't, isn't that what they would say? No, no, they don't see that. Well first of all, this, it turned out total. But what I searched there too as well. If lots of people, I hope more than a thousand AU database, I've got more than a thousand studies your case. Hundreds of dogs that do this and 600 cats. Well I would say the plural of anecdote is data. If lots of people notice something then to say this is rubbish because lots of people say or they've noticed it isn't the right starting point for science. It's meant to be empirical, which means based on experience. So my response to this is to say, okay, well let's test it. Well it wasn't that they'd done the tests and shown it didn't happen.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       No one had ever done a test before cause they assume it's rubbish. So when I do the tests then with the dogs, then you involves filming the dog, the place, the dog weights. Having people come at random times come in unfamiliar vehicles. So there's no possibility of the two. It's a routine response. They can't smell people from many miles away. They can't identify the signed for unfamiliar taxi or other vehicle. Um, and these dogs still do it and it's all on film. So I would say this is evidence for something which lots of people believe exist. And the reason that, um, I'd concentrate a lot in a lot of my work on what I call the mysteries of everyday life, what you call humdrum, um, is precisely because these phenomena are classified by most scientists as paranormal or para means beyond. They're saying that paranormal, which means they're sort of spooky or we were, my point is they're not paranormal at all.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Their normal everyday experiences. For most people. What's paranormal is the claim that these things don't exist. A claim made without evidence on purely ideological grounds near the beginning. Ribbit you said that that basic model of mainstream science is a materialistic one. That material, that Mata is not conscious and consciousnesses at some point in a way that we don't understand a merged from matter. What do you think is the motivation for the defense of Dogma? Why is it so, why is rationalism and materialism so rigorously defended and alternative views? Uh, so vehemently opposed? Well, it's kind of political. Originally it was political in the 19th century, beginning of the 19th century, materialism was quite a small minority view within biology. A lot of people were fabulous. They thought there was a life force or some life. It wasn't just matter. Organisms weren't just machines. Um, but the material is wanted to believe that because they wanted a universal that's just matter cause such a universe would have no god in it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       Why did they want that? Because particularly in France where atheism got going in a big way, much more than an England, the old regime that was overthrown in the French revolution was very closely allied with the church, the Roman church. And they thought that to get rid of the king, you got to get rid of Cha, the church too. And the best way to get rid of the power that the church was to say, God doesn't exist. So the whole thing's ridiculous. Sharman pretends. So in the French revolution in 1793 they abolished the Catholic Church in France. They closed the monasteries, they guillotines tens of thousands of priests and they proclaimed the cult of reasons as the state religion notradame cathedral was turned into a template of reason. Now in Russia where you had a similar massive growth of atheism in the late 19th century. The Bolsheviks in whose revolution account or missed a hundred years ago, 1917, um, wanted to get rid of religion because they thought religion supported the SAR and, and the state, and they wanted to destroy this religious underpinning. So science was an ally for them in this militant atheism. And in Russia in the 19th centuries, they had about 5 million people belong to an organization called the League of the militant godless. That went round a bit like terrifying, terrifying bit like the League of the militant godless.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       They went around and trying to stamp out everything to do with religion in Russia, a bit like the red cards in China. And so atheism was essentially political in the 19th century. And for much of the 20th century, and many people who are atheists wanted materialist science to back up their views because it meant they could reject organized religion, particularly Christianity, uh, in favor of other ideologies. So it was a necessary tool in challenging hatch mini that religion at the idea of God and man's relationship with God was tied up in power structures. These power structures were corrupt and oppressive, needed to be overthrown. I mean no one's saying the French revolution or the Russian revolution where bad things necessary but unnecessary revolutions, but in order to underwrite those revolutions, you had to attack the idea of God, which was the main stay of the hedge money or the sort of the basis of that power. Now, earlier you mentioned this idea within biology of vitalism, there in a, in a a hundred years ago in biology that the idea that there was a sort of a super mechanical component and element that couldn't be tracked was present. I'm learning much about vedic philosophy where they talk about the idea of Brahman,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Prana, Atma the idea that there are essential non-mechanical energies. Now is this, what is this connected to your idea of morphic resonance? How does it relate to it? When you talk about, well, what do you mean by morphic residence? What do you mean by non mechanical energy? Even though it wasn't, you said that it was me.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       Well, morphic resonance is the idea. This a kind of memory in nature. You see contemporary science, one of the dogmas which was established in the 17th century at the scientific revolution is the idea that nature is governed by fixed laws. And the idea was in the 17th century, God is the maker and ruler of the universe. And God is eternal. So God's laws are eternal. And then, um, the idea was that everything in nature has to follow these laws because God is omnipotent. So God was the universal law enforcement agency. That was the metaphor. Yes. Um, so, um, it was a theological consumption and they didn't have the idea of evolution then. And it's very anthropocentric metaphor. The idea of the universe that nature is governed by laws and only humans have laws. Yes. So when you think about it, it's not a very appropriate metaphor to start with. No,

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       they were just patterns. And I like this idea of metaphor and it's, uh, uh, uh, the fact that we are necessarily dealing with metaphor when we're dealing with science. Uh, that it, even the mechanistic model was contrived at a time when industry and mechanization was happening in human culture. So it would have been an attractive model and accessible model when mechanization was happening socially. Oh, humans are a bit like a machine. Nature's a bit like a machine that was in the language. It was in the ether here became inappropriate metaphor for understanding. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       It is, yes. So he sort of nature as a kind of mechanical system made off of unconscious matter based on forces at work, by pushing and pulling at mechanical forces. Um, and the idea that the laws were fixed at the beginning, uh, you see, was it made sense when they thought the universe didn't basically change. But when the idea of evolution came along first in biology with Darwin in 1859, but then with the Big Bang Siri in the whole of nature, as late as 1966, we got to radically evolutionary cosmology. If everything's evolving, then why not? The laws of nature and in fact laws of nature. As I said, it isn't a very good metaphor. Why Not Habits? Why can't universe have regularities that are habits and then as it kind of memory in nature that sustains them instead of some kind of external transcendent mind with fixed laws in it, which is the eternal eternal God idea. I've nothing against God, but I've got a lot of against the idea of God making laws of nature that are totally fixed.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       Yes. It's almost like the requirement for fixed laws is that a requirement in order to conduct study. If there are no fixed laws, it's impossible to conduct study, so you need fixed laws. There must be fixed laws, but in a way it doesn't make sense. If you're moving through limit the space which is continually evolving, it's more likely that there are patterns that seem like laws when observed from a particular perspective but are going to be subject to the continual evolution and change that all other phenomena appear to be subjective.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       Absolutely. It puts it very well and you'll see things that have been going on a very long time, like the crystallization of salt or the formation of hydrogen atoms are such deep habits. They behave as if they're changeless, but when you look at new things, new forms of learning, new forms of behavior, new chemical compounds, then you see the habits build up and the evidence for morphic resonance comes from looking at new phenomenon, seeing new habits build up. For example, if you crystallize a new compound, a new chemical compound for the first time, it takes months or even years before crystals form. But then once you've got it going all around the world, they form more easily. If you trained rats to learn a new trick in London and rats all around the world learn the same thing quicker according to actual evidence, this disputed evidence, or is that stuff that's like, we're down with that?

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       Well, the evidence was done years ago, Harvard and in Edinburgh and Melbourne university's, no one's disputed. The evidence, the disputation is about how you interpret it. And most people thought at the time, well, this just shows some weird effect that we don't fully understand, so let's forget about it. Um, I think the evidence for morphic resonance, you see a lot of phenomenal already there. Um, that people agree about fit with morphic resonance. For example, Iq scores have gone up more than 30% since Iq tests were invented in 1918 and I predicted this would happen myself, not in 1918 obvious too, but in the 1980s, um, because the tests have remained more or less the same, millions of people have done them, millions of people of salt, these problems, it should be getting easier to do the tests. Those calls would be going up. The average scores, not because people are getting smarter, there's no independent evidence. They're getting smarter, but the scores are going up because so many people have already done the tests.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       I see is that there's a shared icloud of consciousness that we're all uploading our results into, that we will have access to access to that. Consciousness is not wholly housed in the brain, but consciousness has some other component. That's one aspect of the theory of morphic resonance is it?

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       It is. It's a kind of collective memory and that idea already existed in this psychologist young. Yes, with his Jerry was the collective unconscious, um, had the idea that we all tap into a kind of collective memory, but he was thinking just in terms of human psychology and I'm saying that's the way that all nature works. It's not just us.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       When you talk to this, he saying because of patterns in dreams that people dream in a kind of consistent language in set and Casey's that motifs appear across cases, across continents that have a continuum to them. Joseph Campbell's working comparative mythology suggest that indigenous cultures produce patterns within their myths that are identifiable. That the s, uh, an African myth or an Icelandic myth can have templates that are comparable, which suggest that consciousness communicates or at least has some essential quality. There is not determined by material reality or geography, but has some other form of connection. I mean, I personally don't have a problem with this idea because I see that the sensory realm is accessible by the instruments we have. If we didn't have a sense of smell, I wouldn't be able to understand conceptually what you meant by a sense of smell. I know that different animals have different ranges of hearing, have different ranges of sites. So it seems to me possible that energy can communicate and travel in means too subtle for my limited instruments to ascertain and receive. So for me, it's never been a problem. But it is necessarily difficult to demonstrate when it's transferred back into the language of mechanics material and identifiable evidence, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Well, I mean, not in principle. I mean, you can do experiments to test this on chemicals, on crystals, on ranch, on humans. So in principle you can test us with the scientific method. I mean, I'm totally pro the scientific method. I spend a lot of my life doing experiments. Um, so, um, in principle there's no reason you can't test it. And in fact it has been tested. Um, it's just an unfamiliar idea for most Westerners. Now you're studying eastern philosophy and eastern philosophy. The idea of a memory in nature is completely standard. Uh, you know, I lived in India for seven years. I worked in an agricultural institute. Um, and the, so I sort of got fairly familiar with Indian philosophy. I was in much influenced by it. I had this idea before I went, but when I talked about this idea in Cambridge on high table of my college career, college, you know, the looks of blanking comprehension or in the tea room of the Biochemistry Department where I worked, um, when I got to India I would explain this idea to Indian friends and colleagues.

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       Even people I met on trains. And you sound test. They, well they do. They are, they asked me first, I didn't, you know, in India, if you sit on the train, uh, what is your name? Where are you from? Ecentra and then give me some of your theories. Yes, about three questions in, you know, after, what is your salary? They ask you what is your view of the world? So I really wants it. So I explained this and the general response I got from Indian friends, colleagues, and even strangers with, there is nothing new in this idea. Ancient Rishis have said there's thousands of years ago. What's the, what's the, how, how is that vedic? We understood the idea that there is this a memory in nature, but it's basically part of the philosophy of Karma, which in in it's limited form is about reincarnation carrying over memories from one life to another.

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       But in it's more general form, um, can be seen as a theory of cosmic memory. And in some forms of Buddhist and Hindu philosophy, they have this idea of a cosmic memory. The Sea Asopus took this up with our idea of the akashic records, which is a kind of cosmic memory bank. Um, so I didn't know all that. When I thought of these ideas in Cambridge, I came to them through thinking about biology and plants and you know, it was coming. How did you come to when I was working on plants, how do plants grow? Plant morphogenesis the development of form. Um, how does the leaf become a leaf? How does a rose fly become a rose flower? Why is an oak leaf different from an ash leaf? Um, I worked hard. I was working on the plant and hormone auxins supplant a hormone that makes cells grow and makes roots form and makes would cells form.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       And I worked hard at how it was made and how it was transported run the plant. But the thing is it's transported round to all plants in the similar way and it's made in a similar way in all plants and yet they have different shapes and so everyone was trying to sell. You can explain form in terms of chemicals and this was the main chemical. Everyone thought was the important influence, but I realized actually it won't explain it. They've all got the same one is and it's like trying to explain what goes on in different shops and factories and schools because they will have the same kind of money. Are you an end to it? It's, it's the, it's something that's part of the system. Take it away in the system would collapse, but it doesn't explain why they're different or why they have that form.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       And an idea that came up in the 1920s in developmental biology was the idea of morphogenetic fields, fields that shape form. I got interested in this, but then I realized these fields have to be inherited somehow. They can't be inherited through genes were changing code for proteins. They had to be inherited by some kind of direct link. And then I run out, asked if it was a kind of memory across time, a great deal of biology would make sense. Not just biology but a lot of nature. So I had this kind of flash of insight and for three or four days I was kind of manic state when I first came up with the idea of morphic resonance because more and more things made sense. And then I got worried, you know, it's a kind of theory of everything and you know, I ought to be worried about there. So I didn't publish it for another eight years. I thought I've really got to think about this hard and look at the evidence. And when I finally worked through a long process, it made, it really did make sense after thinking it through. And that's when I published my first book, a new science of life.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       The idea being that there is a memory that is beyond material that is traveling through time. Can you give us some examples of that?

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Well, the one example would be the, the thing I mentioned with rats. If animals learn a new trick then ranch similar rats faced with the same trick somewhere else on the basis of similarity resonate with those rats before morphic resonance is about similarity in patterns of vibration or patterns of activity. Um, so um, what I'm suggesting is there's a kind of resonance across time that um, just go, Ma goes across time without falling off with time and across space. I mean this is a difficult idea perhaps, but the alternative is laws of nature that are outside of time and space altogether and yet somehow present everywhere. It's not as if the conventional alternative is absolutely mind boggling. My mind bottle factor free, it's just we're used to it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       That's right. You're quite right that to suggest there are objective laws that exist outside of time that is an unusual and as you've said already, it's a, it's analogist to the idea of God anyway. Yeah. That there is an absolute template, a sovereign, uh, a sort of a monolith of truth that stands beyond the, that's in a sense as a paradigm that is the same as saying, God, there's these rules that are in charge

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       except for material is scientists. The rules are supposed to have come about spontaneously by themselves. They're like things in a mind but they say there is no mind. So they're completely paradoxical to have laws that are in material, that are rational, that have no material being and yet no non material substrate is incoherent belief. And yet that's what most scientists believe.

Speaker 1:          00:26:02       How and why it is, I mean what more of obvious example I for obvious that you know, that famous example of the four minute mile as in the film, chariots of fire though no one could break the four minute mile, someone breaks the four minute mile, then people break the four minute mile. It's took a very poor public identifiable idea. The once he's identified that something is achievable, it becomes achievable. It comes sanctioned, accessible. Somehow. What I'm interested in rupert, ease, how dogma behaves and how heresy is regarded in control. Now one of the things I enjoyed in your, let's call it, um, uh, like I, I like to have a band, a Ted talk is a cool thing. I think like in your band

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       a Ted talk is, uh, when you were talking about how mainstream science protects it, uh, dogmas through denial of variation. For example, what's the, uh, the speed of light? Yeah. Well, I gave an example of the speed of light that between, I got interested in this because the idea that the speed of light, it's totally constant and all the constants are constant as part of the fixed law dogma. Um, so I thought, well, I'll just check out. I had no particular, I don't work on physical constants. So I wasn't a particular thing where I had a personal interest, but I just thought I'd look at the data. And when I did, I was amazed to find it varied quite a lot between 1928 in 1950 or so, the speed of light dropped by 20 kilometers per second or around the world. And then it went up again and they were all claiming that they're accurate. They have little error bars on the graph. So you showing very small arrows that the Arrow was like plus or minus 0.1 of a kilometer per second and yet lose 20 kilometers per second difference. And I just couldn't understand what was going on. So I went to see the head of the national physics laboratory at Teddington, um, the man in charge of measuring constance. And I asked him and he said, well, it was constant. Don't even need him, your laptop mate. It's always the same.

Speaker 2:          00:28:17       So he said, don't, well, um, he said, I know it's a very embarrassing incident in the history of our science. And I said, well, does that mean that everyone was fudging their results? So in, in, in, during the whole of that period or around the world to get the expected result. He said, we don't like to use the word fudging. He said, I said, well, what do you call it? And he said, we prefer to call it intellectual phase, locking certainly rate. They then, then it went up again and then they to resolve this problem. They're just defined it. They by fear, they invented the speed of light, the closest value. And they said, that's it from now on, it's defined. And then they defined the meter in terms of the speed of light. Um, so that even if the speed of light did change, you'd never notice because the media would change in length.

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       The same time in the unit of measurement would also alter, I'm reminded of the Melville quote, all human science, but passing fables as we learn more, everything that we think of as being absolute will necessarily evolve because we are only looking at a small portion of all of the available evidence. What do, uh, revelations in quantum physics in your opinion, mean about the nature of consciousness? I know that they're double slit theory is an area that, uh, people like myself who are of a spiritual bent, uh, Lee Paul over as evidence that consciousness impact, uh, mattel matter and the behavior of waves and particles and physicists say, no, no, no, you're misinterpreting this in your drawing conclusions that are erroneous, but what does it tell us without us being too sort of quick to leap on our, um, you know, our chariots of fire and start blasting out the silver trump pits and proclaiming the lord?

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       Well, I think the main, most important thing about quantum theory is it tells us that nature is probabilistic, but there's, there's no rigid determinism. You can't predict things exactly. Um, and there's a kind of inherent freedom, right? Even at the most fundamental put in the most fundamental particles of matter, I think the staff freedom. Yes. Do you mean that just because the behavior of particles and waves apparently altering under observational and under observation? No, the the, if, if you measure the take a single photon going through a double slit for example, you can't predict which way. Whereas lend up which bit of the film that you're filming it with it'll land on. But if you send thousands of single photons, one after another, you get a kind of average pattern, which is like a wave pattern. Um, so it follows a kind of probability distribution, but you can't predict any individual one.

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       If you've got a radioactive uranium atom, you can't, you can say what it's halflife is. We've got millions of them by how many years will it be before half of them have decayed. But this individual atom, you can't tell if it's going to decay in a million years or in the next second. There's nothing that enables you to say that. So there's an inherent freedom at the very foundation of matter. And what chaos theory has shown is that even bigger things like the weather systems have a kind of inherent in determinism or freedom. And the same is true of the way the nerve cells in our brain work. And many of them are on a knife edge. They could go one way or another. So all through natures as this kind of in determinism. Um, that means there's a kind of inherent freedom at all levels in nature. There's certain strong habits, but when you get things that are changing and they're on cusp points, there's, there's this kind of in determinism.

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       Now I don't think the observer stuff in quantum theory, I think it's overrated. The, you know, the consciousness thing. Well basically what it says is that the kind of observation you make in quantum theory depends. It depends on what you're observing. In other words, your observations depends on the Observer. But the philosopher Schopenhauer pointed out exactly that in around 1800 you need the whole of science. He said all observations depend on observers. It, it's not as if nature is out there, just sort of passively observing itself. When we observe nature, we come to it with our frameworks of thought, preconceptions, measuring apparatus at Centra. Whenever we ask a question of nature and an experiment, the answer we get depends on the question we make. So that's a perfectly general point about all science. It only came to sort of pump pillar consciousness through quantum theory, but it's not specific to quantum theory.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       Yes, I see. Now what do you think on a more practical level, the imposition of dogma normally protects the interests of the powerful. Is it important that much of what is regarded as a sanctioned and valorized science is corporately funded?

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       Is that important? I don't think that's important. Actually. Not the most important thing sake. The dog moves of science got established before corporate funding became very important. I mean this dogmatic materialism was already well established by the late 19th century when, you know there are a few German companies making aniline dyes and things about them, early chemical companies making aspirin and stuff. But long before this sort of massive corporate involvement, it was an ideological movement. People like th Huxley here in England, um, we're basic material and that they wanted to spread the message about materialism cause they wanted to destroy the power of religion and make scientists as it were, the new priesthood. If you have a culture where you destroy the old priesthood and where science reasoning and progress of your ideology and every government now being converted to it, economic progress through science and technology, every government in the world, it's a dominant paradigm then who are the priests of this new culture?

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Obviously as a scientist. And Th Huxley wanted the scientist to become a kind of priestly caste, um, professional scientists who would then be the go to people for governments. And in many countries there's a separation between church and state. But in no country is the separation between science and state. So I would say the power base of science is much more state than, than corporations. They've come long later. What is their gospel? Well, the Gospel is, is we'll save the world through science and technology. You know, where the saviors of humanity, um, religions have screwed it up. People just fight each other. But we come along and we'll care. Diseases, reduce infant mortality, provide abundant consumer goods, uh, prolong life. And many of these promises of come true after all. It's not just ideology. It's a very powerful, much less what is not empirical. Well, it's not imperia clears the metaphysical belief system that nature's totally mechanical, that it's all unconscious, that the laws are fixed.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       All these, in my book, the science to illusion, I have these 10 dog, most of science memories, a stored in the brain. That's another one. Um, they believe that because the materialist, everything must be matter. So all our memories must be inside our heads in some way. A memory must have a material component. It must on some level be measurable. Exactly. And therefore when you die and your brain decays, all your memories were wiped out. So every religion that believes in reincarnation or an afterlife or purgatory or whatever, any form of transmigration, any form of transmigration, any kind of access to connections or anything like that must be rubbish. Because memories in the brain is impossible for any aspect of them to survive. It seems to me the rational conclusion of rationalism is that we are individuals. There is no meaning, therefore consume. Yes. And that's why the word materialism has two meanings.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       And in science and philosophy, it means this worldview I'd been talking about and we've been discussing in ordinary everyday language. It means people who go to shopping malls all the time and are constantly consuming things. That connection is telling that and you think, oh, I think so. Yes, very much so. I think that it's not a coincidence. We used the same word for both. Can we talk a bit about psychedelics and uh, you taking psychedelics? I don't want to talk too much about it since most of them are still illegal, but should we talk about how you've never taken psychedelics now it's illegal and wrong today. I'll tell you why. I'm very interested in Terence Mckenna and you were friends with Terence Mckenna when you, in fact, I've heard him talk about you and you and stuff. We were great friends and in fact we had with our friend Ralph Abraham, who's a chaos theory mathematician at the University of California.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       We had about 40 or 53 way trial logs and we produced two books together and it was about 20 or 30 of these try logs are on my website in streaming audio. So, you know, for 20 years nearly we met every year. We spent several days just talking to each other cause that's what we most enjoy doing. And um, one of the things we were interested in was indeed psychedelics. And one is terrance had many interests. Psychedelics is what he's best known for. But he had an extraordinarily wide ranging mind and he was also incredibly funny. Um, well for me, um, just to, I suppose if it's a long time ago and talked about it, for me a great revelation was in about 1971 when I took lsd for the first time and everything. I had been taught about the nature of minds. You know, I studied this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       It Cambridge as an undergraduate, you know, nerve impulses, neurotransmitters, hormones affecting sanctuary, sexual characteristics, all that kind of thing. Suddenly and the immediacy and the incredible power of this visionary experience. I just felt something very, very important to just be left out from this world view. So for me it really was what the term means, psychedelic means psyche, revealing mind, revealing. It revealed a Roho realms of mine that I had no experience before noon at told me about. Um, and opened up an interest in the nature of consciousness. So for me, it was a transformative experience. Do you experienced during this period, long time ago that was so transformative? Describe it please. Well, the first thing that happened was I took it with a French annotating it once or twice before. We thought it took an hour to come on. That's what he thought. So we took it

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       to wrap the site that we can hear police sirens.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       So we took it, we thought we'd have a meal while we came on. So we were in a restaurant and it came on during the, in this restaurant, food started looking distorted, the whole theme. Okay. So I want you to get back to my rooms in college. I was a of cloud college at the time too, that suddenly this journey became a kind of, it went on forever, going through streets and everything distorted. And when I got back, I thought I must have taken a massive area of days. And I thought, cause I felt completely out of control. My whole ego was dissolved. I didn't know what was happening. It had come on sooner than we thought. So I thought this must be a huge overdose. I'll be insane forever, etc. In fact, I thought I must be in hell. And then neon signs saying hell that I've all around me, which proved it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       Um, then a friend, um, my friend sort of talk to me and I sort of came to my senses as it were, and he's not really a census, but suddenly I felt so if I was floating up towards, I saw the light above me and I broke through like the surface of the ocean. And suddenly I was in the realm of transcendent beauty. Um, music turned into forms and patterns. I had the sense of connection with the one at all and everything. And, um, kind of mystical experience. And I later came to know that Stan grof and other people describe this as a kind of death and rebirth experience like that going up through the darkness to the light. It's like being born from the wound, coming out through the birth canal into the lighters, kind of like a birth or rebirth experience. So for me it was a kind of transformative moment of a whole new way of understanding consciousness and my connection with the greater consciousness. Yes, the very idea that one's conscious experience can be chemically altered. That one's perceptions are not um,

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       rigid. For me. It demonstrates the plasticity of reality and our relationship with reality. Terence Mckenna, one of the things that fascinates me about Kim is the conclusions he draws from these experiences with regards to the way that power operates, the control of substances of this nature in me as a person that's in from drugs. You know, I don't take drugs. I'm not taking drugs for a long time, but what I, what I personally in chew it is that there real so many vested interests in keeping people behaving in an orderly manner and if you have access to mysticism, it one tends towards challenging structures and like we said at the beginning of our interview, Rupert looking at frameworks and asking simply why, why does my life have to exist within this framework? Why must I behave in this way? Why is this convention being observed? I think it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       I know when you, what you said about revolutions earlier and the necessity for to challenge the idea of God because of the way that God was operating in power structures prior to the two revolutions that you mentioned you use to underwrite those power structures. I can see the necessity for challenging hedge money in that form, but the removal of God to give you a professor the full niche and quote you, the God is dead and we have killed him and there's not enough water in the world to watch the blood from our hands. The idea that when we lose God, when we lose a way of accessing and understanding the mystery, we prevent ourselves. We have prohibited from being fully human, continually evolving and connected. We begin to regard ourselves in the material model as components that have to have a mechanical function to be valuable.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       We become a tool of consumerism. We become either an asset or a deficit. We don't have inherent value. So I can see the politically why these power structures are perpetuating. And even if, as you say, they existed prior to corporatization, I would say the power behind corporatization is mutated and was present in some other form prior to that. And that it's about the preservation of power structures and always has been. And that's why it's so vehemently opposed. Whenever anyone says, Hey, there's another world there. Love is real. We're all connected. Yeah. Whenever that message starts to come out, people don't like it. It gets dampened down pretty quick.

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       Right. I agree. And I think that the suppression of the, there's a reason why these revolutions occurred. And, um, but what, what it leaves at the materialist worldview where from which God's been removed or relentlessly St Kilda society leaves people alone, isolated and the privacy of their skulls. And um, and is it's a well, it's meaningless and depressing and that's why depression is the endemic disease of modern societies. But that's exactly why I think that in the secular age, when many people have lost contact with traditional religions and spiritual practices are so important. And that's why I my most recent books called science and spiritual practices because, um, the, the paradoxical thing is the sort of ironic that people think of science as against spirituality when if you actually use science correctly and use look in an open minded way, you studied spiritual practices scientifically, like meditation for example, then it turns out the evidence is overwhelming.

Speaker 2:          00:44:52       This is very good for people. People who do it are happier, healthier, live longer. Um, you know, people have figured out which bits of the brain changed during meditation, lowering stress levels sleep better. Um, the scientific evidence suggests these are very, these practices are very good for you. In my book, how I deal with a number of other ones, like um, connecting with nature, which is very important practice for a lot of people, including me and pilgrimage. There's an amazing revival of pilgrimage going on in Europe at the moment. And um, I think this is probably the one that most clearly expresses. Um, the fact that so many people feel they're on a journey, they want to go somewhere there somewhere that connects them with something bigger than themselves. It's the physical journey of a pilgrimages and expression of that such, um, for teleology, yes, there's a purpose to the, the, the, the journey and the, if you're getting an a pilgrimage to the holy place, then you're going to a place which holy and healing come from the same root. So you're going to a place that can have a healing effect on you. You think then that

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       we live our lives extracted from these kinds of principles until they are somehow scientifically verified that w w what you said about meditation, it's something that I've thought about quite a lot that you know, mindfulness and meditation and now spoken or from a perspective of wellbeing, but it has been necessarily secularized. Uh, it's something that I find it kind of irritating I suppose because meditation is, it was being present and suggested and proposed through religious ideologies for Millennia. And was it, and these conclusions were reached not by impure at wouldn't work perhaps by empirical means, but we're not by scientific means. I wonder what other notions found in theology would be similarly beneficial. I don't query the need for change as in the examples that you've already given the revolutionary changes. And nor do I dispute at how religion has been used to support power to, uh, to, to, uh, engine bigotry and oppression.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       Those are like, but, but like a, in my belief system, uh, there is, uh, uh, a line be quick to see where religious people are, right? And this mindfulness example, and possibly what you're saying about pilgrimage, about purpose, and when w w it anecdotally, my experience of the world is even when I'm talking to people, they feel lost, unhappy, disconnected, you know, like, and you could arrive at these conclusions for Marxist theory that capitalism would lead to alienation and people feeling that their only function is an economic one or a productive one. So as you're saying that these group of literally these traditional ideas such as pilgrimage, is it a new way of reengaging with aspects of our consciousness that will be neglected?

Speaker 2:          00:47:53       Absolutely, yes. Well, I think it's re-engaging because it's going on a journey to something that is bigger than you. Um, you know, for example, every year I've been doing this, I have a Godson who's a teenager and you know, I feel as a godfather I should do something for his birthday. And I think, and it stopped giving stuff to people because I think everyone's got too much stuff. So I give experiences. And when he was 14, I offered him, I said, my offer is a pilgrimage to Canterbury rewalk, the last eight miles through fields on footpaths and words. We go to the cathedral, we light candles at the shrine of some Thomas go to choral even song, which this beautiful service and um, have a cream tea and come home on the high speed train. And I said, would you like to do that? And slate? Just to my surprise, he said yes and we had a blissful day. And we do that every year. No two different cathedrals.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       Beautiful. How do you, uh, not that you need to, other than in the context of this question, I align your anglicanism with what you're saying about morphic resonance. You know, like a very, what would people would deckard is conventional faith?

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       Well, I mean, it's not very conventional to be a Christian and modern Britain and you've got 5% of people go to church regularly. Um, so it's definitely not the power structure and nunes in it for the money anymore. So, um, morphic resonance actually fits very well, particularly in my book on science and spiritual practices. One of them, I discussed his rituals and all religions have rituals and secular cultures do as well. And what are some rituals of secular culture? Well, the American thanksgiving festival for example, so national ritual rituals, reenact and original seminal moment in the history of a group. So Jewish people for example, reenact the Passover dinner that happened in Egypt when they fast

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       foreman for ancestor worship and connection. And to demonstrate that we exist beyond our individual selves and the connected to our lineage.

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       Yes, the back to an original event that sets the lineage in motion. And so Christian holy communion is a ritual celebration of Jesus's last supper with his disciples itself, a Passover dinner. Um, so it, it's a kind of ancestral connection across time. And the point about morphic resonance, it depends on similarity. Now if you have a ritual where you use the same language, the same words, the same gestures, the same incense, the same whatever, um, you deliberately create things as similar as possible and you set up perfect conditions for morphic resonance. So in all cultures, people believe that by doing these rituals, they connect with our ancestors. Have done them before, right back to the first time it's done and it means the individual individuals much more than just me. I'm part of a whole long tradition that went on long before me and we'll go on long after me. And this whole tradition in any case is about something bigger than us because Jesus, his last supper, the Passover, it was about more than just those people. It was a in their own terms of an intervention of God into history.

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       Well, I like that. So my individual consciousness is just temporal, but my consciousness has existed before me and my consciousness will exist after me and my consciousness is part of a vital energy, a continual pranic flow existing through all forms existing beyond and through time and space, time and space themselves being just referential points from this biological organism or this species of biological organisms that would be entirely different if we had different senses. That consciousness is somehow reflecting onto the screen of reality rules that are apparent to its own understanding and its own interaction with the external and through these rituals we can demonstrate it, recreate it, connect with it in a different way and see how we have existed like waves passing through time. I like that. But somehow stripped of mystery. These things can seem like, I imagine that some of our out there rather than more radical a listeners my thing, you know the whole cause to me it sounds bloody delightful going for the cream tea and the pilgrimage to Canterbury's or sort of thing I might do actually. But like a lot of people think, oh I ain't doing that. Oh I want to do ios guy with a flick knife. Buyer would so like you know, so like it doesn't it seem, it seems conventional. Whilst you said it's like 5% day seems like, I don't know, what does it seem, does it seem radical? It seems, but what is it? That thing that I'm feeling, it seems somehow, I don't know, safe like it's not going to change the world. Like it's had its moment that it's nostalgic. Is that what it is?

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Well, I think there's an element of that connection. Well, anything that connects, I don't consider it nostalgics connect with tradition in the past. I mean here in Britain for example, we have incredible cathedrals and those were produced in the middle ages when virtually everybody who believed that they were part of something bigger than themselves and the whole society, I mean 3 million people with ox carts and ropes and pulleys created all these incredible cathedrals. Cantor breed our own wells, Salisbury of Centra, Westminster Abbey. They thought they were part of something much, much bigger than themselves. And they're still here today. And I find them incredibly powerful. Um, I don't think it's just nostalgia. I think they have a living presence and anyone who goes into them, um, especially if you're getting listened to this evening service even song where everybody is it as this beautiful music. It's an extraordinarily beautiful and transforming experience.

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       Now I've nothing against Iowasca and I wouldn't like to say this is, it's either all you see for me it's not either or. I think all the spiritual practices are part of what we can do. And there's many, many spiritual practices we can take part in meditations, one rituals or another. And I was, Kara has done as a kind of ritual as a kind of sacramental communion where the participants, especially on these psychedelic churches like Santo Dima. MMM, that sounds good. This is a Brazilian, there's a very big psychedelic church in Brazil. It was two actually more than two, but the main ones are called sent who die. Me. And when you went to Fsu, tyler, which means union of plants and these are churches I have been, I suppose I suppose I should add a long time ago. Um, to services these churches in Canada actually watching the, so the one they liked be psychedelic charities.

Speaker 2:          00:54:39       I'm fascinated why they've got good murals in them. [inaudible] they don't know the, these not, they didn't have buildings. I mean the wellies they may be doing in Brazil, but this is sort of in a room where they rent rooms and things. So what they are at Inosanto, maybe men are all dressed in white on one side of the room, women on the other. And it started to my surprise with everyone reciting the our father and the Hail Mary. And um, and then there's the kind of community where you all go up one after another and drink from this chalice of Iowasca. All right. And then the whole group is traveling together and the person leading it says, you know, this isn't just personal tripping. You know, we're all in this together and we're traveling like in a boat together. And there's periods when you sing together extraordinarily beautiful songs.

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       And then periods when everyone sits in silence and has kind of visionary experiences. In my case, for the first time he did, and I was sort of zooming out of the earth into the cosmos, through the stars, and it was astonishing experience. Um, and then you come back and there's another song. And as the country was very strong sense of group solidarity. But I don't see that that is is um, you know, I see that as a perfectly compatible with lots of other religious [inaudible] sat around having your cream tea. I sounds much more radical to me. I went to this church repat in ladbroke grove quite by mistake as a matter of fact. I like I wonder then and it was, I like to discover Eritrean Christian folk. They had like a, like a screen at the front. They will listen to pretty crazy keyboard music. Everyone else sat me with Airtran and a little kid at the back and a tiny plastic chassis was, seemed to be there in some sort of administrative up the front

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       was the pastor and a couple of other guys. It was pretty uh, intense, you know like um, let the, it was like a feel Jesus type levels of stuff and a guy like, you know, everyone was going out the front and having like proper, it looked to me like speaking in tongues, out of body kind of experiences. While I was watching this all happen from it, from the midst, from the congregation, which was only about 30 or 40 people in this church. You know, I was thinking how, how are we going to go home afterwards? You know, how are we going to pick up our coats now? Car Keys and be normal again like after we have letting ourselves go after we have dispensed temporarily with our identity is hello there cnn. I suppose this is what I mean while you're having a cream tea or you're walking in a field is still essentially you, but while you're shooting through the cosmos on Iowaska, you asked if physically experiencing that you are not just your identity is rupert or Russell or whoever you happen to be listening to this thing right now and watching these Eritrean people in congregation of watched them having a group experience that was clearly transcendent, which was clearly outside the accepted social rules.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       I've thought how will this sees, how will it comes to cessation? I went to the front of my cell phone that the pastor did some ritual on me and where my set killer mechanical condition mind would say that it was all Brouhaha and nonsense except for when like he offered me the healing. The place in my stomach that you grabbed is exactly where I feel the pain when alone anxious and full of doubt. The place that you grabbed that was the place where I feel the pain, you know? And then at the end things did resolve quite perfectly and beautifully and people just chat it afterwards and went back to their jobs. In these cases, I'm thinking a lot of these people were cab drivers and doing pre low pay, minimum paid, we'll jobs, but they had there a communal experience and and I and a I transcendent experience. Certainly it was beyond the accepted social norms of how are you, what are you going to be doing next Wednesday? Did you see spurs the other night? People were, and I feel that if you exclude that experience from your life, if your life does not include that, then what are you doing? What are you doing? Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       I agree. I think that without that kind of experience, we lead very impoverished lives. Yes. And that's why I think like you do that spiritual practices and awareness of that dimension is so important.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       What should science, how can science, which you know no one disputes that without science? No technology without science, no medicine. All the things that you listed, you know, the experimental method. Absolutely vital. But is there a, what do you, what would your biggest hope be for science?

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       I think first of all, going beyond these narrow dogmas, hold it back. My book, the Science Delusion in America is called science set free and it's really the idea is that if we escaped from this dogmatic prison that it's in at the moment, it could become much more positive and life. And I think that if we switch from a view of nature as being dad, unanimous and mechanical to a view of nature as a living cosmos that's evolving with habits and that everything in nature is being alive. Gaia, the earth, the sun, the solar system, the galaxy, plants and animals, not machines, but truly alive. We'll find ourselves in the living world, which has a kind of purpose is not clear what it is, but it we'd feel much more connected if we feed ourselves part of the living world. And then the kind of spiritual principles that give rise to that world or the creative forces that underlying would become, we'd feel they were more relevant and closer to us and we'd see God in nature and God in us. And, um, uh, and I think then when that happens, our lives become much more connected, much more meaningful and much happier too.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       Yes, that's very, very beautiful. And I can't see why that would be controversial at all to regard the world in those terms. Rupert sheldrake your book, I'm telling you this, but really, you know it, your book, just going to let you know in your book, science and spiritual practices is available now. I, uh, I thank you very much. I really enjoyed talking to you. I really enjoy listening to you. I find it incredibly valuable and beautiful and to invest the world around us with love and not to feel that we are just components in a, uh, a mindless and purpose less machine for me. This is not just, Oh, this cheers me up on, you know, on my road to the bone yard. No, it also just feels like it has truth. When I think of nature, when I think of my experience with psychedelics, it seems to confirm that there are forces beyond that which can be understood through the limited senses, that there is information available that can't be understood within the existing template. It seems to be bloody obvious as a matter of fact, and that nature does seem like an uh, uh, um, in motion, a living beautiful thing rather than a mechanical resource. But if you start looking at nature as something other than a resource, a lot of economic interests and political interests would be strongly challenged. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Anywhere. It's a great pleasure to don't try and wrap it up. I'm the host of the thing. Well, all right, but I think you're getting signals. You're meant to be wrapping it up. Refresh your drink. I want to go bloody Cathedra with yeah, it would take us in all about one. Yeah, I word yes. I'd love to go with you. We'd go to a cathedral would walk through a field and like weird. Let me just have a cream tea and then we'd go work aphasia. Which ones? The best ones? Dharam cancer. Well we could start with Westminster Abbey, which is quite spectacular and amazing. Really? Yeah. And they do choral even song practically every day. Even song. You mentioned it all the time. You're not the best. It's the best way. And I mean I've, you've done done this empirically know what works for people. Um, if people are committed Christians, holy communion is the best way.

Speaker 2:          01:02:26       And, but if people are not used to that, then choral even song is something that can include everybody.
