Speaker 1:          00:00:01       You're listening to one of the scheme of Russell brand, Mike Esterday, Scott Hindi. Andrew's an offer, an associate professor in sociology and he's also doing the first black studies degree anywhere in Europe at Birmingham City University. His research specialism is race and racism is director of the Center for critical social research, founder of the Organization of black unity and coach out of the black studies association is contributed features to the Guardian and his new book, black radicalism is out next year. Welcome Chi. Hello. Thanks for having me on. Really greatly to come on as you know, like that my motivation for doing these podcasts because I'm at. So as university you've been doing it degree religion in global politics and what I felt like the sort of a dilettante's glee at new information. And then like when I was sort of getting given essays and stuff, I think, you know, the minute I could meet these people, I've been on the tele. So this is part of that is in a way it's like make a wish foundation just for one, making one person's wishes come true. Um, so we wanted to start around the area of empire because a sort of national identity, a ethnocentric national identity in particular becoming very prevalent both in our country and America. Wanted to talk to you about colonial nostalgia and would you explain what that term means and what this particular moment around brexit and trump, if you've got any analysis on them, like to kick us off with?

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Yeah, so I mean the term colonial nostalgia, it kind of refers to if you look at the public discourse, particularly around brexit and the vote leave campaign and the idea that Britain is great and Britain can go back to the time it was great. Well the time that Britain was great was when it was an empire when it rolled over 25 percent of the world when the colonies stretched out to the empire. The Sun never sets. And that is the basis of, of Britain's wealth today. And that is kind of what people are looking back at. How do we go back to that colonial prestige of Britain Nebula? So when we say greatness mean tyranny and oppression effectively. Yeah. With this, this is what we're celebrating and because we teach empire so badly, we don't really understand the horror. I mean, the British empire was killed more people than the Nazis. Uh, it was literally a form of fascism that laid waste to whole whole areas of the world and hope peoples of the world

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       quiet if like an institution or nation killed more people than the Nazis. And the main reason we think the Nazis are bad is because they killed so many people. Does that mean the British empire was worse than the Nazis?

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       Yeah, I mean, in some ways actually the British empire and the Nazi's aren't separate in any way, shape or form. There's a book that I'm Bauman sociologist called and road where he's called Holocaust and identity, and actually argues that how we think about the Holocaust. These though somehow alien, it's so outside. It was so horrible. It could never possibly fit within our wonderful enlightened society. But actually in the book he makes the argument that the west modality capitalism is the only society that could have produced the Holocaust. And the reason for that is racial science. When you think about the idea that Jews aren't really people and we can prove they're not people from measuring in food science, what end, that's race, that's the same racism which produced slavery. It says that I'm not fully a person and you can treat me like cattle. That's the same, same racism, the same science that proved that Jews were in human. And also if you think about the, the amount of death, that scientific process of death, there's nothing new about that for the Holocaust. I mean Belgium, uh, the killed about 10 million people in the Congo slavery wasted. It was millions and millions of people. So in a sense the holocaust is like the logic of capitalism just don't tell people we consider white and so it becomes law. He's horrible.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       Right? Right. As far as two things, yes, of course it was people that were white. And also I suppose in terms of their trajectory, it was a innovative commerce, civilized country where people live in civilized lives and the victims were civilized. So in a way, I suppose it reveals a lot about our presumptions around race, if you wouldn't even in a modern context, I mean contemporary context. Consider that was the same. Yeah, but hold on a minute that it was all living in Africa and that it's not as bad because I didn't have net cut and.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       No, and that's the problem, right? So big you see the logic of the western imperialism in Europe for white people and then you see it, this is terrible. But actually if you look the Holocaust is, if you think of the Holocaust is being one of many imperial terrible things that happened. It's really not even in the top 10, right?

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Right. Because it is the way that we categorize this information of like, you know, like, like as if there's a like a handicap system, apply it. He's was white people. So that's the worst. Then down at like that. So, uh, your obviously right, thanks for illuminating me on that. Now, um, how is that idea progressing and how is that perpetuate in the idea of racial science and that term? I know from school net crow politics, how does that, how is that continuing now? Where is the, what's the front line of these arguments that are at their most evident in the most evident form of slavery and Holocaust? What's the version of that we're living with now?

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Yeah. So after the Holocaust and then people see like racial science is, is terrible, and actually maybe we should move away from racial science. And before the Holocaust he was just science. It wasn't racial science and it wasn't controversial. Correct. That was just what we all kind of agreed. But when you see that happen, uh, to the Jews, I see that the terror of it in Europe, we've kind of abandoned race. So will hear people will say race doesn't exist. Racist, problematic. We should move away from the idea of race, uh, moved to ethnicity. The problem is the way that we think about ethnicity is basically exactly the same way. We thought about rates. So there's different ethnic groups, but their racialized. So I'm Caribbean, but then you lumping Caribbean with African on the black, then you have Asian, which is India and Pakistan, et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       Then you have mixed and even if you look at the sensors, the hierarchy of white to black is actually visually represented, right? It's white, Irish and then he's Asian. Then it's mixed. He's black and you see they actually, the way we talk about ethnicity, he still says that black people may not be inferior because of biology anymore were inferior because of our culture, because of language, because of our traditions, because we haven't got any history. So it's just a, it's just a different version of the same thing I thought was interesting. So power you say mew tights but doesn't often accede in. I like, it's like, oh, we can't do it in that way anymore, but it is a new way. Yeah, exactly. I think about, if you think about what's, what's, what's, uh, racism really fundamentally about, it's about creating a system that says you have Europe, what are the top, you have Africa black the button and there's various gradations in between.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       And that is actually what global politics look like today. It's not a coincidence that the poorest countries in the world are in Africa and the richest countries in the world, the European West white countries. That's. That's how it was designed for 500 years ago. And that is exactly how it is today. What possible. Other argument could there be other than previous colonial exploitation, some actual meritocracy? Is that the actual argument? The flat white European, small advanced. It's different and Africa, it's primitive. Terror is maintained. If you think about are you doing a degree in international relations and international development? I've been going around to a lot of places recently saying, well actually what do they teach? And even international development, they're teaching you how to underdeveloped parts of the world. I mean there's a whole. A whole colonial education system isn't just about Britain. It's about the elite from Africa, Caribbean and Asia coming into Europe and learning about economic policies and political ideas which are actually there in place to continue the oppression of the of the country.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       So you have this idea that you can develop the global south through aid and through technology and through et Cetera, et cetera. We've missed the point and it actually these places of the world of poor because the West is rich. That was the same then as it is today. That hasn't changed in any way, shape or form. It's integral, I suppose, isn't it, that that story is concealed because it is at odds with the assumption of Justice and Mary that is required to maintain a power balance. Yeah, exactly. I actually talk about whiteness as being more like a psychosis than like anything else, right? The idea of whiteness and progress and civilization, et Cetera, et cetera. The ideas in the enlightenment that Europe is kind of the civilizing mission that spreads that truth to the world. That's not rational. I mean there's no rational basis did it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       Because there's a lot of. I don't know if you've read any critical whiteness studies, people like David Rottiger and I'm knolling native who talk about the idea that you can kind of teach at whiteness. If only white people would understand the problem historically, then they'd change and become allies and we'd all be happy. Families actually I argue, is much, much, much more serious than that. The reason you have this myth of progress, etc. Is because that within the political economy, the west needs to exploit the wrist and so what we do is we have this psychosis which says, actually no. NIce, all right, it's fine. We're doing a good job, etc. Etc. and that's to hide the fact that actually the we're really living on the back of children dying. I mean that's what we're doing, right? Children die because of the system which gives us money and so because we can't deal with it mentally, emotionally, we create these myths about how wonderful the world is,

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       right? So it's like I say, psychosis that has to conceal its essence in order to perpetuate. And even as sort of a little while ago and that t via online news blog either. We did an episode on like literal kids mining for some resource for your mobile phone. So it made a very clear connection between, here we are in the weft, ordinary people that don't feel like we've got blood on our hands, but in our handheld device is like, here he is, he's seven years old. He's got to go down. Oh no, it's like a ballroom. And you feel like it doesn't belong in your understanding of the contemporary world. Now one of these things about whiteness as power. Obviously I as a white person that feel I like, I have certain attitudes towards the state and my sense of alliance and allegiance Would be countercultural. How am I categorized by a, like in the terms of this new emergent narrative around power and oppression?

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       Uh, it's interesting because this whole discussion about like white allies and it had this, had this, it was oxford yesterday talking about this and sometimes I feel a bit like a standup comedian when you kind of go around and he played the little display, the audiences and you get different reactions and you tested your material.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       It's good because I feel like an academic. Because when you said I've done this at oxford is good already. At the same level as oxford university with my questions,

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       but it was good because they actually is a question of whiteness came up, you know, what can white people do where the white people, what can we do to solve the problem, the federal, and it's. It's a tricky question because if you take my idea, if you take what I'm arguing here that whiteness is a psychosis and psychosis are irrational, so and actually in the left you can see this as much as you can see on the right, so you have left wing people, swp marxist who will make these global arguments about x, y, zed who will say they were on the side of the oppressed, but actually when you look at what they're saying that they, they just as deluded as the right wing fascist because whiteness as a concept is so important. And I'll give you an example I'm at, so anybody anybody's black and knows and goes to black events and african caribbean community, the swp, a socialist workers party, they're more prevalent than the police.

Speaker 2:          00:11:52       I mean they every day they're always there. They're always there peddling marxism, marxism, marxism, and I quite like mugs and by the way, but one of these events, there was a, it was a few years ago, there was a strike of set african farm workers and teachers were always having a strike here in this kind of moxies will rule the working class. we're all workers were all in the same struggle, etc. Etc. They were saying that we had to support. We're going to support the workers in South Africa. We had to support the teachers. Right, but they think about this for a second. Work is inside africa. Farm workers are pool are so poor because of trade policies that benefit british farmers and european farmers or farmers effectively and that impoverished in marginalizes them in their conditions or conditions that we could never even contemplated. Right now. Teachers are paid out of taxation from that very system which was floyd said african farmers, so women were. When teachers are asking for paintings and better pay, what they're asking for is a better is more fruits from the exploitation of places like South Africa. So in no way, shape or form are these two people together? Actually they opposed to completely opposed because teachers, anybody on myself as well, we make our money off their exploitation and that's the psychosis of whiteness because you can't understand the actually your part, we are, all of us here are part of the problem, not necessarily the solution,

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       but when you have a systemic contradiction such as that one within which your participation is voluntary, other than like I've literally, I'm out of the system now. Like how do you avoid that aNd how can alliances be formed on that basis, that thinking then if you think of a power like, you know, like I've what I thought was brilliant that, that oj documentary when to use it for that, they use that oj simpson documentary, a story about race in the United States of America. Stories about crime, stories about commerce. Capitalism a racial tension. But I mean really in a way that I could understand. Tell me a lot of important stories. And a lot of it was about a oj simpson's racial identity at a time when the civil rights movement, when people were making huge sacrifices and mohammed ali, you know, the sentence and gave up his belt and all of that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       But like there was an interesting moment where it said, well why does the oj simpson, because he is an african american man, half the obligation to be like, well you've got white. Like you wouldn't know why athlete or white star would have that obligation would be expected to carry that mantle. So it began to sort of challenge what whiteness and blackness mean as sort of categorization system. So like if like, you knoW what this distinction I exceed there is a historic colonial and indeed contemporary continuation of these themes and categories. But, but there, there is this, a crossover isn't there because let's say barack obama as the, when he was the president of United States, he was an african american man, but he is in the, if you use that argument about the south african farmers, the teachers who he is the puppet, you know, he's the president over folks on his team. How does that all work?

Speaker 2:          00:14:56       Yeah, I mean, and this is part of the thing with a psychosis is I always say this isn't just for white people in any way, shape or form. Let people live. Many, many, many believable would also kind of embrace this kind of psychosis. All right? I was one of the most critical people still am one of the most critical people of barack obama's presidency. You have a black president for after eight years, literally every single indicator, apartment, employment. And if a black people went down and even if you look at employment, black wages went down so much. They actually, employment was basically irrelevant. And so you think then what we achieved, what was achieved by these and actually the celebration of obama, particularly by african americans and black people here in my mum cried when obama was elected. That's part of that psychosis, right? That we think things are changing when actually if you look at the evidence suggests that none of these things are actually changing and in many ways to get in, they get worse.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       So then what's the value of that as a category? If it is ultimately, as you said, literally meaningless. In what sense is he an african american president? Other than like he's able to say how he felt in shops and that kind of stuff. And like, you know, like things that you fill in bloody hell. This is sort of amazing and a fist bump. Avoidance of literally superficial, which I suppose is sometimes what I think race ought be in utopia. Like in the, a superficial monica. It's what was the value and meaning of it. Would you say that there really wasn't any?

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       Uh, no, there was. So they'll, you'll find some academics. He will be very critical of obama. But say, well look, it's limited what you could do. That's the problem. We can just move on. It's not that big a deal, right? I'll tell you, I'd actually take the opposite approach and stated that the symbolism of obama, the point of obama's blackness, one of the reasons why he got elected was part of to aid this idea of the psychosis was to aid this idea of the american dream. For me. Barrack obama's blacknEss is violent in itself. Go on. Because what does it do? What is. So what is it that my mom's grinder and mom was a radical in the, in the, in the sixties, and all these politics about revolution, etc. Etc. And she's crying on, um, on, on the day this very near liberal politician, you never offered one single thing to blake.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       Never said he was gonna do anything for black people, but we just kind of assumed because he's black, there's going to have something. Right? And then you see afterwards, everybody's kind of praising the symbol. You've got black family in the white house and obama with young black men, but actually get belief that symbol. What's that? Trying to do, that's trying to tell you that things have progressed, that things have changed, that progress is being made, but again, look at every single indicator tells you that from black people, particularly in America, things are getting worse, probably not better. And so the symbol of obama and why his blackness, how he used his blackness and why he got one of the reasons he got elected is because it keeps us more diluted and tied into a system which can never providers freedom, justice or equality.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       People will hate being told that story I fancy

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       and probably not the most popular to put things, but it's also the truth, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       That's right. So that, that, that, that type of critique, we say no, let's not get distracted by what appears attractive and what appears beautiful and promising. Look at how power is actually behaving. So like to return to my prior point about like how do I as a white person from a working class background whose attitude is always been anti like me reaching for my little slice of the pie. I like, um, like a, like how do I, um, participate what like how do I, like when you say that about the british empire, right? I sort of think like, god, yeah, it's all built on like biscuit tins or union jack on it and land and open glory and light over the butcher and people in India and africa and doing whatever was required and, and nation was always a front for corporations anyway. And the whole thing's been a black, right? I'm on board. So like how do we have alliances that aren't caught up in sort of bureau bureaucracies such as that teacher, south african farmer alliance. How do we go, well, let's let the radical white folk in there. There'll be of some use. Or is it like, can it not work?

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       I, this is the bar, the material we some testing now. It isn't maybe the best [inaudible] I'm a big malcolm mixed fan. I love medical mix and

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       may I know if that's all right with you boys. More the merrIer.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       Deb backup as a story in geography where malcolm white lady comes to ask them a similar question, what can white people do? and he basically turns around and says nothing and in walks up and he feels bad about it. You have malcolm x anyway, probably a bit nervous. He's an intense guy and she was crying and she was really upset and he felt bad about. He's like, okay, I shouldn't said this actually. Yep. People have the responsibility to go into white communities and making these, these arguments. Um, I've already advanced much more than that. One of the things that malcolm used to do was just to go round and tell white people. Literally they were devil. I mean, he'd say you do evil, like what? Look what you've done. Look at this critique. Um, and I guess as, as a black scholar, an activist, that's the most I can do. I don't know if I can have the answer to what you can do other than to prove the critique. Runk I would love to be wrong. But actually if I'm looking historically, presently, currently at the left as well as the right, I don't see how you break out of that cycle. That's why I call it a psychosis because it's completely irrational. There is nothing you can do to penetrate. And actually to my, of my, my, my work is more about what we do as black people. We had a with,

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       of course that must be, isn't it like how I would have a person or allegiance around like addiction or wherever because that's where, that's just what I've been drawn to from my particular wound, like a. And that's where I feel I know score on that so I can be relevant and I can be useful in that area. I can't go around camp campaigning on behalf of the group that aren't, don't share the experience of, um, but what I feel like pure conjecture, of course, given the nature of what I've just said might be the solution or my question is, is it not that we weather these categorize these categorizations are, um, but the way wherever we find ourself within that sort of peculiar college, all the light that we be the nine, the cat, like a suit, a transcending the categories, not the nine. What the narrative is like.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       I'm like, I'm wars and his has happened and I'm aware of it now in the industries I work in. I work when I'm at meetings around television, I think, wow, we're all white still. I'm sort of aware of that into an but like what, what's, and that sort of super relevant and, but what I'm interested in is that as long as our identity continues to rewrite those categories, even if it's through overflow in them, we continue in somehow to augment them by like, you know, like that by saying, well, no, this is our story and this is what it is. I completely accept the importance of it, but how do we ever go, right? We don't win anymore. We don't want power to work in that way. How do we Challenge it in dismantling if we are a wednesday two welded to somehow to our categories?

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       Yeah, and I think this is was, um, I think it really does. It's really about taking onboard this critique in a very serious way. And I don't think the left the left is a general thing, but people on the left markets, other academics have done this in the sense. So for example, if you look at the mobilizations like occupy, occupy wall street, we're the 99 percent. I'm sorry, that's an, that's an offensive way to look at global global inequality. If you are in, if you, if you own the average wage in britain, hearing someone like the top four percent of earners in the entire world, just recognizing that the conditions that we are not just white people, black people who live with have hear a pause in a completely different situation to the conditions of people in the third world. So for example, there was recently a child bereavement, enough inner family circle of friends because a car accident and two years later everybody's still shocked by it and shook by it because it's so foreign, but actually in many parts of the world, children just die all the time when a child dies every 10 seconds because they haven't got access to food.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       So what that means is we're protected from that, the horrors of the system. So for us to pretend that we're all in this one big happy family of workers that that needs to go, you say one thing to take that ethic of the equation, completely understand that all of us here at a meeting included are complicit in the system and benefit from this system. I don't think you see that in much of the of the left. Unfortunately that will be a starting point and maybe you can build a proper politics after that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       I sort of awakening. Yeah. Is that like what you said there like that? There's that famous orwell quote, you know, the british working class is in India when I was on bill maher, you have a day and like it's sort of a, you know, they very much romanticize a bomber and like, they're very much like the opening. I like bill miner, but the opening jokes were very much about, um, you know, sort of, oh yeah, well, you know, you're not a president. Like about. It was very romantic and nostalgic and of that. And then the subsequent conversation was again, sort of about intricacies of the, you know, the democratic party in the way they elect candidates now for this is the way you have trump is because this is, this doesn't appeal to people on a visceral level. It, you're, you're not addressing the inability of conventional politics to tell a truthful, open, clear story. Um, so how does politics have to alter is safe. How do you end up in it like that? Because I think both brexit and trump, I see them more as failures of the left or failures of progressive truly progressive thinkers as opposed to triumphs for the right. So what, what is the obligation of progressive, even if you don't use the terms like lifting rocks, I can see how they're becoming problematic and somewhat redundant and they are part of the promo record, but like this,

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       well, it's in many ways the trump embracing a response to the logic of the lift as well in some ways if you have this national politics that says, well how do we get the next weekend for the working class in the uk or the working class in America, which unfortunately a lot of the lift has done. Then being anti immigrant and being a bit racist, it makes sense. Here's a logical thing that's a logical thing to do. That's the history of the lift, particularly of britain as well. So it really, I mean, it really thinking about the trade judy, and think about like people always say, let's go back to social democracy. My family came to this country on the social democracy. They were colored bars, couldn't get taught in school. So you weren't, um, weren't allowed to join. The trade union weren't allowed to vote.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       I'm into this association, couldn't live in this area, et cetera, et cetera. Actually under social democracy, the racism that we're experiencing now and saying, oh, this is terrible. It was like $5 worth right and left wing social democracy working class. And the racism was far more severe on an open level than it is today. So in some ways these aren't trump and brexit on, on, on alien to the lift. The tool is that if you even corbion got criticized because he never really came out about brexit and because there is a strong left wing argument that guy can, you know, you want to protect wages, etc. Etc. Because a lot of the left is framed around the nation state, right? How do you protect britiSh workers, how do you protect american workers, et cetera. And so what we need to do for the lift is to have a much more radical approach to politics. And it's not like thIs never happened. So if you look at people like eric told him, right? And neo marxist, he wrote, he wrote a lot of work to the black panthers, american near marxist in the seventies. I'm emmanuel wallace. Dean talks about world systems theory, so there is, there is a theory that says, look, we need to basically divest of our privileges in the west and really understanding our place in the global system that works there. Unfortunately it hasn't. It hasn't necessarily worked to influence how politics work.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       What do you mean divest of privilege? I didn't like the sound of that

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       is about. It's about acknowledging except as a black man, for example. I have to understand that I don't suffer most of the of racism, right? I, I'm not unemployed. I don't ask him by the police. I have higher education. I have, I am one to most people in the country, right? So I have to understand that, that I'm in a privileged position and I have to understand also that because I'm in the way that privilege come from, it comes from the exploitation of people that look like me, which means I then have to build a completely different politics that says, how do, how do, how do we relate to the least of us in a sense? How do we draw these global idea? But, um, child deaths and politics around the world, etc. Etc. Um, And understanding that I to do this, I'm going to have to give up my privilege and this is what people don't want to do. Right? This is why the probably the limit. This is probably why I'll never work because for us in the west to really have a radical politics, it will mean we have to give up privileges and to what extent are people willing to do that?

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       I suppose the power structures that perpetuate all dependent on our unwillingness to give up comfort. If, if people had a sort of. I'm more spiritual, I would want to say attitude towards asceticism. If people were kind of hardened to the idea of no, I know what's right and you're not going to be guiding me with your iphones. You're going to feel like. But it's very, very hard to get there a couple of times a week I think. Would I be more happy if I was to fill my house with people who were refugees started that I didn't like? What would my sum tote of happiness go up? I'd send to be spending less time reflecting on why shouldn't really be having this privilege should I know, but much more time we bloody hell. We brought the toilet or whatever it would be that day, you know, like so like, but it requires it that I guaranteed it this wicked speech about where he said like, you know, so there's no point in us overflowing the british then replacing them with a comparable system.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       You might have heard this given that you have degree courses in racial politics like so, but there's a bit where he goes like, you know, the fact is it comes down to the idea of our attitudes towards comfort. As long as We are addicted to comfort, then it's really hard on some level, on a personal level, you have to go like, this is where. This isn't theory, this is where. This isn't something you read about books, scope. Am I prepared to give up my only phone? Would I be happier if I had less stuff on? On some level I sort of feel I would be. And what prevent. There's a kind of fear though, indeed that prevents me from going, right. I'm just going to walk out into, because I suppose my personal privilege and wealth is what I feel protects me from this system, from this world.

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       Yeah. And I, I can see why people don't quite, you know, people know who wants to give up stuff, right? And particularly if you work in glass to give you a blank, um, use this discrimination, right? So we're seeing that is clearly unequal. It's clearly not fair and we fill it badly treated as well. So that's also part of the problem that says, what am I going to give up? This have worked quite hard to get it as well, but unfortunately that's the reality. Huey newton, the black panther is a, wrote a book, a revolutionary suicide. They said this is what revolution is about. Understanding that you have to be able to give up for those people who are, who are less than Mrs. White. I have very little faith in this happening in europe. And in effect, the, the concept we always talk about as a radical concept is blackness because he's, my blackness is the way that I look at this is the, it's the hair is the, that's a connection to people who are at the literal bottle. So when we talk about the child that dies every 10 seconds, the vast majority of those already in africa. Right? So that gives me a connection that you don't, that you don't necessarily have right now. And that should give me a connection I should have. And that should tie me into politics and remind me this is a global struggle, not a national struggle, which is why I have a bit more faith in. That's kind of was kind of black movements then I would have in, in the us and european movement. I guess

Speaker 1:          00:30:14       if however, the only people that care about that exploitation and you know, even in the most severe form such as child deaf, are people that have a visible and cultural identification with it. And even then it remainS theoretical impact. I don't know what. To what degree are you involved in activism? Like they're like, how is anything going to change? In fact, it seems to me that until you get to that point that huey newton point about self sacrifice, which is really martyrdom, is an idea that again, is resourced from theology. You know, how, how without a spiritual component is radical radical change going to occur because how the human beings access ideas such as one less true for fraternity transcendence, relinquishing individual identity through social and cultural like or, or material forms. Like how'd you go? You know, because it doesn't have the necessary potency is not emotive enough. It doesn't seem.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Yeah, I mean there's, there's two parts. I mean, one I think in terms of you look at the black struggle and that kind of global politics. There are people at friends fan on a. We'll talk about the idea that user who was a martinican I'm postcolonial theorist and he will talk about that, that you need to sleeping beauty of the european working class to wake up basically and you need those allies to have this, this, this revolution. Even the panthers would, would have said this because they were marxists. Um, because of like you said that you need to have this almost spiritual. It's something beyond just rationality, something more than. Yes, this is why I say it's probably never gonna happen, right? One, we have a system which has always protected the western working class who always from the worst exploitation, a provided comfort and wealth and provided it as an outlet.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       So look at the left. Now they're saying, look, can we just get a bigger share of the pie? Not can we change global poverty? Can we get a big share of that? But yeah. And so I'd be unlikely to see that happen, but can you see that kind of more emotional if you like, theological, spiritual in this concept of blackness. This is why log. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a potential possibility. And rather than wait and try and get the allyship of people who are dumping river, going to have massive allergy, let's just go with what we have and organize what we have and produce a movement that can actually this, that by itself would be enough to destabilizing and kick the bucket a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       I see. That's good. But it's, for me, it's more entrenched in precisely because of it's inability to transcend systems of categorization. There have been previously established by the power dynamic that you seek to overflow.

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       Well, no, because that's

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the thing about, about blackness. I mean in some ways that you can say, and this is the critique, we get a lot lower. This is racial categories that are from europe, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But actually blackness is concept. Talking about. It's really the opposite to race a race is about biology is about hierarchy. It's about europeans looking at us and saying, you are not really human. Blackness is, oh, this is looking at each other and going, oh, okay. We've probably gotten the same african background. We've got that dissent, uh, we're seeing these europeans are doing these terrible things. They're trying to categorize it in this way and we're going to reject that. So blackness isn't a bad hierarchies in the bad. Biology isn't about genetics. It's about saying there's a shared shared meaning of color that's a shared meaning of politics. And we come together and organize in order to benefit the community. But it doesn't have those elements of race, so it's a different concept for me. Now shifting the idea of reparations because it's sort of, I suppose it's a practical idea. Can you talk to him about that? That for western wealth is founded on colonialism, that there could be a redemptive mentions or is that idea?

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       Um, yeah. So if basically if you look through historically, it's very clear and very obvious that the wealth of the west is built on slavery, colonialism and genocide, like very clear. And if you just take slavery, for example, I mean slavery is about 300 year system, uh, places like britain. America is literally built off the back of it. Parts of london. Liverpool wouldn't really exist. Glasgow in scotland, scotland to get off the slavery. But my son name's andrews, so that should tell you everything you need to know. slavery and scotland, birmingham, even because it was not a poor we get, we tend to get away as well from some of these slavery stink if you like, but the industry evolution, james, what matthew boat and they were all heavily involved in slavery, took lots and lots of money from somewhere. So if you think about the industrial revolution, which is typically seen to be the marker of the west right, and how progressive it is and scientist cetera, et cetera, or the first real commodity that was made in just revolution was cotton and cotton grown in britain.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       Right? I mean they don't grow on it. They got caught and was in America. It was in the caribbean and so is that that commodity and that wealth from, from the cotton industry, which was from the slave trade, which really gets reinvested back into the industrial revolution and therefore you're able to have the rest of the program, etc. Etc. So the money that you needed to have something like the industry revolution is 100 percent tied up into, into slavery. So tHat's what we mean. Birmingham, for example, made some, some large proportion of all the guns and all the shackles that were used in the entire slaved rate. We only made the guns in shackles. They were barely involved. Exactly. British ships, british, even things like, um, finance capitalism, insurance starts with the slave trade. Lloyd's of london, you celebrate it. I think it was 400 years anniversary of the day. The ceo comes on tv and says we're happy to have our roots in ensuring the merchant trade. And what she meant was literally the slave trade. That's what you talk about, slave trading in lloyd's of london, the merchant rate psychosis, but just a few ships tried to sporting goods.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       So you can see the roots of that. Financial institutions are cities ever. You probably couldn't have much of the world that we have today with it, without slavery.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Capitalism, I suppose, you know, like one component in it, like, you know, sort of creating excess value at excess worth. SO anythiNg you can do to reduce overheads, like, like we found ways of reducing the next stuff from other countries. Get other people to work for no money at all. And that's really, that's the all the line and the unicorn and the land and the hope of glory. It's, that's what it,

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       yeah, I mean that's 100 percent and what it does consume. And so if you think about reparations in America, most of this work has been done in America and they tried to calculate, um, I'm pretty strong legal precedence, so 300 years of unpaid, unpaid labor. You just work out what the labor would have been, what the cost would have been, what people should have got paid for the work that they did. Um, and then there's also a precedence around trauma and abuse. So for exAmple, for the holocaust he talked about earlier, germany's paid airbags like $90 million or something like that because the numbers are maybe more than germany's actually paid out reparations for the harm. That was cool. So let me say these two categories and say that you've got to pay for unpaid labor. You've got to pay for trauma. Uh, in the states, they reckon it's anywhere between four point nine and 15 point 6 billion trillion trillion dollars that's owed to african americans.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       It would essentially unravel that's nation, that system as we know it. That's why it can't be countenanced thought discussed because you can't have the United States of America. Now that we're, again, we're framing it economically. And I read this wicked thing off of this. A native american, he called himself or maybe even of Indiana, I can't remember, like a, like activist and he said all these sort of systems, you don't come up with marxism capitalism, they're all sort of your ideas when in and none of them were best. We have a completely different framework for understanding reality. But, and you can see that with something like reparation that what begins to unravel a national identity, it will curious. I fought in that James Baldwin documentary where he goes, that the whole category of negro is required in order for, uh, the doormen and pat the dog, the dominant power, I don't know, sort of force to have, uh, enough, uh, identity to cast a shadow onto that. That category is created in order for whiteness to prevail, not only economically, but also kind of psychologically because in a way economics is there sort of an external system that comes from somewhere and it, and as, for all forms of categorization master that they, these, that I suppose one of the things that we're arguing these, there is no essence to categorization these external forms that retrospectively except for that moment where you talked about blackness is having some veracity in terms of visual identification. But I was, I was sayiNg then the um,

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       the, how,

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       like with that reparation argument you can't. So in a sense like what would happen if they give you, pursue that? Where does that go?

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Yeah. Well guess this is, this is the,

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       the cool de sac of reparations is on word to put it. I dunno. So logically there's no real argument against reparations. Look at. So you look at, so people talk about, oh it was a long time ago, things have passed, etc. etc. But actually the effects is still very, very, very, very clear. not just what are the descendants of enslaved but also in africa. I mean, just the populating africa today, extend alone has had a huge negative impact on the economy so you can see the effects of slavery as though their reparations were paid to the slave owners. Imagine that and actually gave her praises tO this label because it was that there was that much money involved. They will have to give me some money. Right? They serve. Sorry. Losing single slaves must be terrible hardship. Exactly. There was a. You'd a ucl unIversity college london, just a legacy of british slavery project and they've traced where the equivalent of 2 billion pounds that went to the british owners of slaves at the emancipation wind and you can see it's in the church is in the middle classes in david cameron's family. It's literally forever for the economy, so it's very clear there's a problem and it needs to be restitution paid for that problem, but you're right though, when you start to add up these numbers, I mean if it's 15 trillIon in in the states, what would that be for the uk? You talking about? You can't. It's impossible. It's literally impossible for the west to pay these kind of sum of money. It would destroy. It would destroy us.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       There is no west in order to do it. It means that the west has to dismantle itself. The power, In fact, don't all arguments about power reach this nexus that well, in order for the power to respond correctly, it would have to dismantle itself whether you're, say you're talking about a transnational corporation, if you're too matt lloyd's, lloyd's in order to behave rationally and acknowledge its origins would have to not be lloyds anymore or gmo for that time. they were putting out cars they knew were going to catch fire, but it works out cheaper to let it happen. The only sort of possible responses for there not to me. So the systemic changes required are so absolute that they in a sense defy the dynamic because it's like if, uh, if you say right America, britain, colonial, former colonial or colonial nations have to repeat it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       But, and what I feel like is that transference of wealth to africa, if, unless there is systemic change or you have now is now the dominant forces within africa behave in that way and in a way isn't it a bit of a red air in, in that it's sort of, I think is it still happening, are sort of very simplistic, unproductive but bloody hell. What did you expect when you came on in? Like, like sort of my argument is a bit like, but people sort of. It goes a bit like this, right? You can't have slavery no more people have like it's bothering too many. People are like, I've got influence,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       but what we can have is will pay people the absolute bare minimum. There'll be a subjugated under cloud. So things just move on. If power finds a way of manifesting itself continually and making the minimum compromises, which is why I think this is where the power of the reparations argument you follow it through to its logical conclusion, tells you that the problem is irresolvable within our political and economic system, and this is where you need to have a radical change and actually what we should be organized will revolutionize the change you need to have. Their institution needs to be made, cannot be made in this. Again, to quote medical mix. Uh, this system is, um, it's impossible to have freedom, justice and equality for black people in the same way that it's impossible for a chicken to late a duck egg. It's just not meant to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       Right? And once we realized it will start thinking of much bigger solutions to our problems, that's the power of, for me, that's a pair of their operations argument to tell you how see how's embedded in the system is actually quite brilliant. Yeah, it is. Because it leads you to the point and going, yeah, but hang on a minute. If you did that, there would be no America. And then that tells you, oh, America is therefore built on it. Exactly. And that's the problem. So let's think about different solutions and when you think about power manifests and inch and giving concessions, this is kind of what we see with the reparations debate. So carrie con, which is a caribbean collection of caribbean countries, are currently arguing for reparations and there they've kind of stopped asking for money. Now it's about can we get some development aid?

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       Can we get an apology? Can we get some education, will do tHe apology for it, for it. It's a different set of demands, a set of demands that the west could do, right? It's not impossible. They could do this and then it could absolve them of theIr guilt to say, well look, we, yeah, we apologize. We gave you this development aid. We wiped off third ward did, but it actually didn't change the problem. Problem is doing it. The issues are still there. The structures are still there. So you can actually do reparations in a way that makes things worse, not better. Unfortunately. Yes, I say, but it's like it's one of those spreads that if you pull out it, things fall apart. It makes me your right. So what kind of, what are you going to spend the rest of your, I mean you might not know, but what, what were your most immediate objectives in terms of bringing about change?

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       Where do you like now that you know all this stuff now, the teacher, the staff in your position, you're in what you're gonna do. Um, so I think in terms of the book I'm coming out next year, black black radicalism is a manifesto of theory theoretically, but also practically they say, well actually what is black radicalism mean? What does this politics do? What does it lead us to? And where it leads us to is to an organization that transcends a nation state that connects us to the poorest and the most abject, that condition. And so it's actually less work on building revolution. and so it's kind of built on 'em. So when malcolm x, like you, I probably have mentioned malcolm like 10 more times before we, before we finished where malcolm dies, he's working on the organization of afro american unity. He says this organization is, is the revolutionary organization because you have a, you have a place here, you have a place in New York place in caribbean, a place in Jamaica replacing and garner a place in all over the world and you connect this organization together and now you've got that kind of unity and solidarity across borders.

Speaker 2:          00:44:37       They can actually have a proper revolutionary change. so this is the word I'm trying to do currently.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       Hey, what do you think is the significance of malcolm x's islam? To me it was a muslim. It was a lack of proper cloth. He was a devout muslim like you because you're coming at him from the angle of being a black man in england. 2017, like, like isn't as much or could it be argued that is it a muslim icon as well as a african american or black icon? And how did those categories in a sec, particularly in a climate where islamaphobia, so president. Yeah, so I think malcolm question came out of nowhere.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       Being a muslim is a. He's not incidental, right? And actually malcolm, when malcolm becomes really radical, some outcomes in the nation of islam for about 13, 13 years when he comes out of prison and it transforms him, but the nation of islam is very much a religious organization in that he says that the solution to people's problems is to become muslim and that's kind of the. You just become muslim and as a prophecy where god's going to wipe away all the white people and we'll be fine. So we need to do is be muslim and he sees that that's, that's the kind of religion, whether it's islam or christianity or whatever it is that you don't want to have basically because it limits you and you don't really do anything. You just pray. And eventually malcolm leaves because he sees the limits of any because it becomes a sunni sunni, sunni muslim.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       He goes, he goes, he goes to. He goes to maker. He has a. He has a different kind of islam and he becomes in many ways more developed so he finds the mosley must incorporate, but very clearly in the ballot or the bullet speech in [inaudible] 64. He says, start a speech, says, look, I'm a muslim, but you need to leave your religion at home. Keep your religion between you and your gut because this is not. This is not what we're talking about when we do this organization work. This is black people stuff and you can be whatever religion you want to be, but it has no impact on the politics. So malcolm makes it very, very clear separation.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       Do you think that was a political move knowing that there was actually a trenchant christianity, even black population in America that time? He didn't want to caUse a rift in that way, but I think

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       so important philosophically because I think he's saying he's just saying that religion is that religion is something that makes you connect to the world and makes you. It gives you spirituality and it gives you something personally. Religion is not something that can solve any of our problems on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       Yeah, but that's, to me mate, is the big argument of secularism that religion is a private matter. uh, the, um, whereas I think of like spirituality, not religion because it's such a hot potato as having the motivational power to bring about the kind of revolution revolution that's required because I don't, you know, if you're sort of when you sort of get start to tee up on that precipice that you'll take into by thinking when you pursue that reparation argument when you think, oh my god, that would mean the dismantling of the entire, uh, europe as we understand it and the United States of America as we understand it. It also sort of revealed he didn't narratives the way around. The way that power transcends nation has continued historically massed by flags and our own willingness to participate in their rituals. Whether it's consumer rituals or daft secular holidays. And suddenly all of this is exposed.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       And I think that if you're asking people to take on board ideas as radical as you know, as simple as radical, as seemingly trivial as put down your phone and start caring about little kids down a mine, the only way they're going to do that is we have some connection to something transcendent. And I don't know. And I obviously say this is a white person and I was really enjoying the moment mate where I was talking to you about malcolm x. I was like, there's bits where I was going to contradict you. I thought this is good. This is good stuff. Professor of black studies now. Yet again on the subject of malcolm x, my feeling is that people are going to need to find a resource that's extremely potent in order to countenance such sacrifice. And I know the civil rights movement in, in its origins, you know, like sort of them early student type prOtests where then girls got murdered and.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       All right, I've read the brilliant thing. I think it bothered that malcolm blackboard. So it's pretty good pop thing. But you're saying that the kind of allegiances were formed. Then what sort of local communal and tight and he was, I think it was an essay on house or the limitations of social media and how like you need sort of proper connections, but then people also were christian in that like, you know, there were other sort of like they were transcendent belief systems like whereas you said very plainly and overtly there boldly that religions not going to do nothing. Well, like I don't feel like, you know, mark, I'm very, very evident to me the way that religion is used to sort of categorize subjugate divided to the shame and all those things. But I feel like how can we transcend these systems of categorization unless it is by saying they read some essence to the self and some essence to the whole world.

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       I mean, I think, like I said, I don't think so. Even even with malcolm, he says, look, split the two you couldn't separate is islam from his politics. Right. And I think that that does motivate people to do things. I think the key thing is to say that there isn't one religious answer and I think that's what math was basically trying to say is if you're a christian and these motivate you, if you're a muslim is motivate you. If you were jewish and it motivates you or whatever religion you are, we use that to motivate you, but actually in terms of the program, in terms of what we're going to do in terms of where we go next in terms of the alliances that we make, religion just going to get into weight. I every level. Right, and separate and saying that look, the earthly problems that we have with the problems that we have and in some senses blackness. The way malcolm talks about the. We'll talk about it has that version of spirituality to it. Has that other connection to it

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       been the same way as you were saying that malcolm x meant when he was saying religion will get in the way. What was ultimately a rice get in the way? If like if you take your argument of blackness as the motivate in a sort of bond for a sort of a revolutionary movement, where, where does that, what's the goal of that? Where does that. We've won the war.

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       Yeah, so the idea is always like I guess if you look at malcolm's politics will be revolutionary panafricanism at the african revolution and in and that's kind of when you've got rid of europe and China is agitating, you've got different economy, you've got politics, right? But that's never, that's never been the end for that. Politics always said, well look, african and black people in general contact pot in the global revolution because we ain't got nothing. Like we don't have anything sweet. Or where was the. Nobody at kohl's on I'm blabbing have enough. But when you have a power base and If you could do this revolution, that revolution could. That would firstly probably undermine western capitalism to the point he would no longer exist, but he would give you the ability to, to join in with other revolutions and other groups and other and support those groups. So the black, the black revolution is if you let the starting point to the global revolution, but you have to have that black revolution first. I guess the argument.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Yeah, that's sort of my. Why is that? Why would you, why would it have to stop? Because that has to be at the level of the most oppressed or most severe. Why?

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       Well, I know. I guess in theory you could have say the equistar in China because the other parts of the world. But if we're saying look from a, from a black perspective, you say look, this is. And also if you take that logic of the most severe, the worst depression, there is a strong argument for africa being that place. And I suppose my motivating because of the

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       economic ramifications as well, like if africa as a continent says we don't want trans, like all of that, we want a clean slate from that. So in a bloody hell when you think about that debt cancellation stuff, it's not like a.

Speaker 2:          00:51:47       And as an active large, yes we will cancel that debt. What we give you by nikudos stuff and it's not like an act of kindness is it has in stopping, so in adding insult to injury, again, I keep going back up again, but he's a great and in the metaphors he says, if you, if you stab me in the back and then pull out a knife six inches, then I can't. I'm not going to thank you for that. And this one day cancellation effectively is like pulling out a knife six inches. The knife still there. You haven't told him that you haven't changed the debt cancellation debt in the first place was just a neo-colonial tool to keep people in a nice no. So none of the things that the west will ever offer you is really is really solving the problem. You've got to take the knife out and heal the wound.

Speaker 1:          00:52:26       How do you get on with making these arguments outside of academia? How'd you get on with a young black people that are not within academia? How do you convey these kinds of ideas? Do you remember too? Is that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       Yeah, I mean it's the same. So like we started the organization of black unity, this is one of the things that's the kind of the root of it. So we took, literally took malcolm when he died, before he dies, has a organization of afro american unity as a constitution, which nobody ever talks about it and it says, listen, this is what you should do. And we said, okay, let's do that. Let's just see what, see if it works. And so we're working in birmingham to get to talk to people, would talk to young people, older people. Uh, we're in an early stage, but we know we're constantly having these conversations as like campus on campus as well. And you'll be probably not surprised people relate to them. People understand them. People get this. This world doesn't, couldn't even provide for them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       Yeah. Because I suppose even if you don't economic, if you don't know it, we've knowledge as it were, like a in terms of information. I mean if you don't know the information, somehow know it, you know, in your gas. There's something I think in people that resigns, you know, when people talk a lot about political apathy, I think it's like it's not apathy. Is it rational? Oh, that's that

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       dude. We've participate in that. Yeah, and people don't. We haven't given people the opportunity to be involved, particularly in radical politics and radical politics. I mean, radical has become a bad word in general, right? We throw it around about islam and terrorism and etc. Etc. But actually what we've done with this is we've completely misunderstood what radical is. So radical islam and jihadism, extremism and the complete opposite things like completely not believable. So extremism is when you take the, the basic premise of a society or an idea and you take it away forever, then it makes any sense of ticket, right? That's ms dot. That's what we're having with these terrorists, right? That's the same as nazis. That's the same as christie fundamentalist, etc. And radIcalism is the opposite radicalism. You take the fundamentals and you reject them. He said, well actually I don't want these.

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       I don't like this. So you look at capitalism and you say, look, now I'm going to be a market store. You look at going to be a radical and you rejected. So in a sense you can't actually have radical islam because radIcal islam would cease to be islam. Just wouldn't be, would be something else. So we've completely conflate extremism and radicalism and made radical a dirty word. We actually radical. That's where we need to be. That's where we need to be pushing people toward. That wasn't a coincidence then you think that that word has been deliberately tarnished because if you think, um, what's 50 only 50 years ago? See, late sixties, it wasn't. People really underestimate that. The fact that we were on the precipice of global revolution, I mean really if you think of communism in the east african continent is massive politics there. South America, there was a, there was a moment where I look like the west may not with the maintenance of life. And since then they have this literally destroyed with both violence, physical violence, and also symbolic violence, uh, destroyed radicalism. So they told us that radicalism is Bad relative to the wrong radicalism is violent. Radicalism is all these things and pushed us away from those radical movements. But really radical movements are the solution to these, to these problems. The only solution to these problems.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       Can we criticize some contemporary figures and you've got some, lIke a proper, a provocative quotes and stuff. Eg, what about that theresa may's worse than Donald Trump? That's

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       was that provocative. Mostly it was illogical packet for us. Well, and again, I say quote medical lady said elisha, like literally, I just quote medical books. I do call other people as well, but he always used to come up that came from a paper. I've just really literally in a book about, um, malcolm distinguish between the southern wolf who is kind of bare their teeth and a very aggressive and very Openly racist. You got to know there the problem because they're banging on your head and they'll shoot you, et cetera. But he actually says that worse in the southern wolf is the northern fox who's the tricky, who's counting, who tell you, tell you everything's fine in this whisper. Sweet nothings into your ear, but really they're just as bad. And if you think about racism at the time, uh, in America and the civil rights movement is all about the south and it was about, you know, the southern wolf was about segregation.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       It was a bad, let's, let's, let's get rid of this overt racism, but any of the north, we know you haven't got legal segregation is, it's actually more segregated in the north than it is in the sale. And look at looking today. Nowadays, look at the police killings. They usually in the know of another set of look at the ghetto that's often not the same as well. And so even though the north telling you all these wOnderful tales by, so it's just as bad and in some ways it's worse than itself. So this is the kind of thing I was saying with the Theresa May. Donald trump is very, very clearly openly white supremacist racist, obviously quite proud of it seemingly.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       Right, like a white supremacist racism that was revealed with that charlottesville moment, or is there other stuff that

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       historically, in the nineties there was a big case in central park where there was the, um, there was a rape in central park and it, and it was, it was pinned on a group of gang raid. This, these african americans gangs were supposedly gang raped. This white woman complete lie, a complete fabrication. Who was there trump champion this myth, Donald Trump. But Donald Trump was there, one of the worst offenders in this, uh, central park five rape case. Then you've got barack obama is not american who was championing Donald Trump. Donald trump was hugely proud of that. And now you've got the muslim band, you've got charlottesville, you've got all these, look at it as very racist. And he just raises historically, directly personally listened. I'll be surprised, but Theresa May has tried to clothe herself and being, um, you know, so when she was home secretary, she was, um, the police stop and search.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       She ordered a review into stop and search and just the other day she had all the race antiracist campaigners in her office around this. Um, let's look, talk about racism. Let's tell you the stats that I could have told you the day before, but anyway, we're going to have a big parade about how bad the countries. He likes to pretend that she's, she's good on race, but she's terrible. I mean she's as home secretary and if you look at the policy around migration visas for people from african countries denying people enter into the country letting. I mean, she literally had a policy that said we're not going to send boats into the mediterranean to save brown and black people were just going to let them drain to deter other people from coming. I mean, that's a dead negro policy. It's what she's basically saying. All right. So if you look at government policy, look at what she's done. She's terrible and race, but she presents herself as being someone you can talk to, someone you can relate to. That's the northern route, which is more dangerous,

Speaker 1:          00:58:56       right? Yeah. I feel that that's correct. I like that, um, as a slogan that stop over racism, overt racism, overt racism, overt racism out of football. I've been mapping my subtle racism now, but they're covert structural stuff. There's crafty racism. I'm like, so the donald argument, they something like, gosh, is it not an easy argument for a white person or an english person to make? And I'm both of those things. You only one of them. So like, uh, is this something to be said? The, the, the, the grotesque amplification at the trump represents the seven wolf argument that there was something beneficial in that. It's an honor ignorable hideous carbuncle mr. Oh my god. We're now confronted with what our society means. Whereas as long as you had, as you said, there was a different kind of violence immeshed in barack obama in the concealment and the apparent book. See, we've got a black president, but you know, do, do you think that there is something depending on where it leads to almost, if not positive, cathartic about.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       Yeah, I say it might sound controversial, but I'd rather have Donald Trump as a president than barack obama. Honestly, I mean, really in terms of racial issues, it's just clear, it's obvious is it tells you exactly what you need to know about this society, whereas a bomb was fronting is making it seem like it's something, it's not. And so if you look at the, uh, the protests, you look at the movements, look, people get angry about things that's there now in a way. It wasn't necessarily the, I mean, it's not like he wasn't there completely in black lives matter emerges under obama, partly becaUse I think people will, like, we've got a black president in, shouldn't we expect a bit more? yes. But I think if you look now who look at definitely the rhetoric around America is racist. This is problem. Did it at a. I think you've seen that comeback more and that's what we need. That's the starting point for the kind of politics that we need. Donald trump,

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       hero of african american.

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       Uh, I will, I won't go that far but, but yeah, bad precedent for hours I always say at. I'll put it on record with Donald Trump is the president of black America than barack obama.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       Wow. That's cool because like the thing that seemed sort of where that appeals to me is that the, I think, and this is obviously a personal thing as opposed to a cultural thing for me, is I don't like bullshit. I don't like the feeling that we're not actually dealing with the problem. It's always made me feel uncomfortable and it's made me want to tip over tables. It's made me want to be explosive and to sort of release a kind of romantic volatility into the atmosphere because I feel like no, this isn't real and it's something that was a person or it comes from a personal experience, but perhaps there isn't no distinction between personal, political experiences on some level. I felt as a kid there's something ain't right and at score for this isn't right. Like that filled that truth is not being conveyed on a very sort of practical level.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       What will that. While I was at school feeling like I don't feel like this is a beneficial experience that I'm having. I'd like an interest in my little belly, so like I would at least like, yeah, like I sort of like, oh, right, these geezers and also in it, like as the president now, right? Oh, I get it now. See now pro power isn't pretending to be your friend anymore and I don't see how any, the only sense of attachment or connection or ajit, ajit, uh, um, affection. Anyone could have a. Donald trump will be like, that guy looks like how I feel kind of, I feel angry and I don't like life and he looks like that feeling as a president. So you know, like I can't imagine how anyone could have any real, legitimate sense of allegiance that you feel like, well, what do you feel like with that charlottesville?

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       Do you feel like, ah, I suppose you don't feel like it's your problem. But sometimes when I feel like, um, when like white people are marching around with tiki torches in charlottesville or wherever it's about statue or something that seems to sort of really sort of know necessarily in literally abstract in fact that is dealing with a symbol a lot. Like your life will not get better if you pursue your argument to it's natural conclusion of repatriation or wherever easily into your personal life will not improve. How do you. Do you not consider that to be part of the argument that is required by like say black community? Do you see it much more focusing on creating solidarity? Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       Well no. I mean this is the, the counter argument to the, to the whiteness stuff, unless you look at them, probably a chunk of the people in charlottesville, a number of the people who voted for Donald Trump, white people, they're not really getting anything out of voting for Donald Trump to get rid of your healthcare. Whoever made these crazy decisions all the time to actually vulgar with things which make their situation worse, much worse. Right. And I guess that's the kind of counterargument to this whiteness thing. If you could tell people, listen, if they could understand these and maybe they would actually, their interests will be better served with the big. A lot of people with everybody else, right? With a different kind of politics are there.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       The thing that I've felt for a little while is that the way that power operates is there must be a strata of people in institutions for whom the way that systems operate are not problematic for, for whom the systems are functioning correctly. There's a struggle going, no, there is no problem because this is perfect. This is doing what it's meant to do. Then. Right. And I sort of think, oh, okay, I'm not in that. Then there's another one that's a privileged elite that whether it's like for someone like me this from an entertainment background that's like, oh, I'm pretty cool. I'm greg over. I want to do, I want as long as I don't rock the boat as I found out when I did it, but I agree. And like, um, and then beyond that, it's just various degrees of fucked going down and down and down to you've got nothing, you know? And if it isn't part of the problem that people that they, it's very difficult that once your, you know, both of us in our way and now included in culture in a way like, well that's pretty good. We've got status power so that most people go, oh, I don't see him as batman and find it hard to, you know. What was that thing you said about privilege, privilege, privilege, yet?

Speaker 2:          01:04:45       Yes. I think this is. This is part of the pump. I think also it's really important to think about when you say it as those layers of people who it's not a problem for. I would extend that to more people than probably most people would extend that to. I think that's important, right? Even the poorest person in this country doesn't deal with child death really on a daily basis. It doesn't, doesn't have those exclusions and so they may have problems and they may be huge problems of inequality, but with the politics that we're mobilizing, are we just trying to make it a bit better for people here or are we trying to make it better for everybody and I think there is a consensus. You could come to say, well look, you have a bit of rich little bit pulled out, will equal arabic and everybody will be perfectly happy, but it wouldn't solve the problem for child death in public yet. so.

Speaker 1:          01:05:27       Great. I agree. And I must be taught to care hindi though. They, that, that argument can be made from the right to demotivate people. I think that even the poorest people in this country, you're doing all right. At least you're not dealing with some bad kid in a mine. And they're like, I need more say steve, what was it? What, what do you think being an educator, what do you think are the obligations from, uh, from their perspective of education? What should we be being taught the reality of colonialism and imperialism with that? What impact would that have?

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       Um, I mean, I think that's important. So what, what is the reality like? What is, I mean you think about empire and think about we, the people don't know, you can't judge people for what they don't know. And unfortunately we don't know. That system is terrible at telling us things which are really important. So I think teaching about empire, just teach just that if you just say, well, let's teach an honest account of where did britain gates will from where it is brain sustain his wealth to date and understand how the global system works and how the global system privileges us. I think if you could just eat that, that will be a starting point, but then it will be. But I think it's a bit more than that. So for example, with the black studies degree, uh, that we started, we have these arguments, but then we put them into practice.

Speaker 2:          01:06:33       So they said, well, what are you going to do about it? How are you going to mobilize? What does that mean to how you act in the community? How do you as an actor, as an academic, I can just be an academic. I have to be an activist. They have to be a member of the community, have to be building these organizations and doing this work and really teaching people that they have a responsibility to make this better. The he kind of is a comment on us with the privilege to make things better. I think that's important as well.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       Both of those things are important. The first part it seems like I can imagine that feeling like a kind of heresy, which makes me recognize again how arbitrary the distinction between what you call one course, the religious and what one calls the political, how that line is arbitrary because if you are in a school guy, right? This is what british empire is with that nice in depth analysis in africa. We've done that in Ireland and the outcome you can have your coco pops enjoy lunch and I was like, no, don't say that. It's going to ruin everyone's morale. It's sports day tomorrow, right? That's the first thing I'm going to say, and with that black studies course, how's it going and how many people were on it and is it all black people?

Speaker 2:          01:07:32       Yeah, so he's going, well first year we've got about 20 students, which is what we expected to get without a target to get a. It is actually usable by people for the first time. I'm sure in America, african american studies is lies. Lots of white people, asian people. It takes a while to. To the stuff? Yeah. What about that woman that felt like she was black in that? do you remember that story? Which one is an idea? So I feel like I'm black actually. So like what does that, what did we go with that? Is that interesting? Because I was a duke university didn't mind it may or something and I was giving a talk about blackness, citrus, citrus and african american studies department and somebody turned around and said, well actually the way you're talking about blackness being this political concept stage, was it true? Doesn't that mean rachel dolezal is black? And I was shocked. I mean I couldn't believe it because african american studies. I thought it had been a bit more nuance

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       that's not really covered the basics,

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       but I think if somebody like that, I mean if you're taking. If, if, if I'm, if my argument is that right,

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       the

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       color of my skin is important because of the history of it in work it tells about me and what it tells me about the connections into. Then you quite just faked it like you guys make that up life. That's the thing that unites you politically then to try to pretend to complete not only destroyed any concept of unity sense, so it's utterly offensive, but I wouldn't ever get really mad about this because you probably just got mental health problems. I mean real, real level. I wanting to be black later, really want to be black. What is that? That takes a particular distorted view of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       I liked the music in the edge, not so keen on the slavery. Yeah, I see. That's interesting because identity politics can become very divisive in as well as creating great cohesion and momentum and this is a moment I feel around these kinds of ideas and I suppose as a white male, I'm uniquely qualified to pontificate on all facets of that guy and that was an amazing interview. I really, really enjoyed it. I feel properly like educated on a broad area of topics. Plus we got stuck in with some real populism. I think notably the moment of Donald Trump is a bad precedent for black american and barack obama. That some radicalism, right?

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       Hopefully people will put. People's. Mothers will put a picture of donald. Donald trump won the war after I said that. That's what your mom cried when Donald Trump becomes president. He's going to cry with. Listen to this.
