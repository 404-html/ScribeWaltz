Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to Russell brand on under the skin with me today is my guest, Mr Vice President Al Gore. Thank you for coming or thank you for having me. It must be straight. There's a what's your film and I loved your film. Whenever you come into a room, everyone stands up. Is that standard even like you get standing ovations before joke's been delivered? Well sometimes, sometimes it seems to be the case in the film. Now I just do establish it so that you don't feel obligated and tense about the promotional aspect of what this interview must contain. I think it is important for people to see this film an inconvenient sequel speaking truth to power because for me it rendered the issues of our global ecology in a way that was easy to understand. Made it clear that there is an imperative that we act now, but also there's great cause to optimism that there are shifts both from right wing thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:52          People like your man at the end near that sort of our lovely mayor who shifted in Georgetown, which is I think sort of like the bullseye of what you would call conventional republicanism and also the, the politics can be functional and effective. That's what I got from the, your activity at the Paris climate conference where you're able to put together that deal with a solar energy company in India who may have reneged on a, on a, on a sort of, on the Paris climate agreement, little Doobie. No. Then it will be the United States there would renege on that deal anyway. So like I think it's an important film for people to see. One of the things that struck me, uh, Mr Vice President was the way that you appear to be guided to some degree by your spirituality, by your faith. Much of it was like words like mission that you see as a personal mission and uh, also that some of the language is somewhat biblical, unavoidably because of the scale of the ecological disaster we are facing. How do, how does your spiritual perspective inform your mission to affect global ecology? And our attitude towards it.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Well, first of all, thank you so much for doing this interview and for putting so much thought into it, Russell. Um, I don't wear my spirituality or religion on my sleeve, but it is a core part of who I am and this is a, an issue of biblical scale in the sense that the future of humanity could be at risk where we not to grab hold of this crisis and solve it. The good news is that we are beginning to do just that, but, but there is so much at stake you, it's really essential to put it in the context of will we have a future or not? Again, I'm convinced we will, but uh, this is not the normal issue. We're now seven and a half billion people. Our technologies are incredibly powerful and we have to wrestle with our vulnerability to short term thinking and greed and behaviors that don't really move us forward into the

Speaker 1:          02:58          future, which are indeed spiritual

Speaker 2:          03:00          issues. Greed is a spiritual issue. One of the things I was struck with time and time again because greed is to prioritize personal need over social need or fraternity, the Brotherhood of man, the collective is a spirit. These a spiritual issue because individualism, I was clocking Betsey's face in the background. I'm always scanning rooms is why I live on Mr. Vice President. I liked saying Mr Vice President, by the way, it's an enjoyable thing for person to say. Often I have professors and doctors in here and yeah, I'm touching a little licks, social climbing lik spill. I get to use the term like they, it feels my own sense of grandiosity now, right? If we live in a world where a conceptual and a fictitious idea such as economy, he's prioritized over an actual factual and material ideas such as ecology. What hope do we have?

Speaker 2:          03:44          How? How can we change people's conception, conception of ecology when we have a a generation of people, there've been schooled in consumerist capitalists thinking, how are we going to unpick that inner generation? Do you think the economic arguments such as solar panels are cheaper, will be a sufficient tool to unpick generations of indoctrination? People they've been taught to think like capitalists. Well, I think that the, the rapidly declining cost of both solar and wind and now electric cars and now batteries and sustainable agriculture, forestry, fisheries, these new techniques will help us, but I think you're right that the emphasis on mass consumption as a pathway to happiness is definitely a part of the issue. You and I probably disagree on the role of capitalism per se, and I don't want to get sidetracked too much into that.

Speaker 1:          04:46          I want to think it is a sidetrack because how is it that people can ever think of the world as their home in the way that you generally do with your affectionate rather beautiful attachment to that image of the earth, that first photograph, when people clearly see the earth as a resource culturally, economically, and I think on a deep philosophical level, if people see the outside world is something that can be consumed, relationships that consumed commodities, they're consumed ideas, media, they're consumed without a fundamental insignificant shift. How can you hope to achieve such an ambitious and goal? Thanks mate. As saving the world. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:24          Well I do totally agree with you. Uh, the, uh, we need a shift in consciousness and we need, uh, a a keen awareness of what we're doing to the earth. Uh, and, but, but I do want to tell you about my views where capitalism is concerned. I believe that the alternatives to capitalism in some form or explored in the 20th century, both on the left and the right and they were found to have some, some serious problems and excesses. But capitalism in its current form I think is in need of serious reform. We need to start putting a price on the so called externalities like pollution, also the positive externalities. A, we count investments in education and mental health care and treatment for addictions and community services as as an expense. And then we ignore the benefits of those expenditures. So that's a distortion that needs to be remedied. We don't account for the depletion of natural resources and we should, we ignore the growing inequality in incomes, which is threatening the future of democracy. If we don't

Speaker 1:          06:35          up. Yes, because built into the economic model under which we labor, there is no potentiality for the inclusion of crisis right now. The failings of the ideologies of the last century and all their extremism and the war and the have a good they rigged for me, does not put a full stop on the potential for new systems and evolve in systems and merge in national socialism. Terrible, terrible idea. Communism as practice, particularly Soviet communism, which really repeated the model of the czar ism that proceeded it rather than being a legitimate, you know, Soviet experience where power wasn't paralleled and equalized. I, you know, clearly a huge failure, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't need to be huge shifts. I'm thinking of, I've heard this quote and I want you to think about it. It's by this man called a Sateesh Calla east. When he spoke to Bertrand Russell, who obviously in the late sixties was a prominent campaign for nuclear disarmament and he said, what's the point in getting rid of these nuclear missiles if we don't change the consciousness that invented them?

Speaker 1:          07:28          Because people will continue to manifest these kinds of tools and these kinds of weapons. Something about that stays with me, that what you seem to have experienced personally is a transformation in the way that you see the world now. How much impact can be had politicking at the Paris climate to get India to accept solar power only for the u s to renege on it because of individualism, consumerism, materialism. A platform that's been laid for 50 years for Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn't appear in a vacuum, although there seems to be one inside of him and it like, so like, you know, so I think that, how do I think we have to be to a key to the kind of thing that you want to achieve? I think that there needs to be a transformation on an individual level that is quite, quite profound.

Speaker 2:          08:14          Yeah, I think that's true. I think that there are fundamental truths about human nature that are going to cause both problems and opportunities. Whatever political or economic system we find ourselves living in. I have always had immense respect for those, uh, for the founders of the United States of America because they were humanists who separated religion from politics and actually took into account some of these truths about human nature. And I'm a British citizen. Lord acton said famously, power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely. And putting boundaries around the accumulation of too much power by a single individual or a small group of individuals either in the political system or the economic system is a recipe for danger. And one of the problems we have this, one of the reasons we have this climate crisis is that the large carbon polluters have accumulated too much power to influence our politics. And they distorted the conversation about climate by using their money to put out climate denial and create false stouts in exactly the same way that the tobacco companies did years ago. They hired actors and dressed them up as doctors and put them in front of cameras to falsely reassure people that what the doctors had found out about smoking cigarettes and lung cancer was not true. And now the carbon polluters are doing exactly the same thing about the climate

Speaker 1:          09:49          except with a half a century of entrenched and funding for academic studies. So now they don't require actors because the whole thing is theater. The whole thing is a play. And when you talk about the potency of a utility monopolies, uh, Mr Vice President Al Gore long name to say continually, Oh you can accuse al just now. It's actually happened. Your adequacy if you want to be proper, your adequacy for is that, that's a formal okay. Instead of your activist. Sweet hell is fine. Cause I for a minute, for a minute, you were laughing at their rigmaroles of English culture, Your Highness. Uh, I mean we have a title over here by God. Um, so yeah, like for a person that's been vice president, the United States in a period in which many of the economic decisions that have led to the kind of entrenched monopoly utility monopolies that we are on the Asian American now there's this suffers is a pap test or you're a fair word to you.

Speaker 1:          10:45          You know, you were there. Yeah. So I've heard it said before that a lot of people said, oh, I left parliamentary left Congress so I could focus on politics. You know, because you know, Yanis Varoufakis came in here once and he said politicians only have power within the limitations of their role. Did you find that when you were vice president, the United States that your power was quite limited? That the, our ability to be effective, particularly with their issues that you're passionate about? Like ecology, we're limited because ultimately stay power is nullified by superseding economic powers and financial interests.

Speaker 2:          11:16          Well, I think, uh, the skillful exercise of political power, which includes the mobilizing of public opinion, can bring about to more potential for change then perhaps in any other position. But one of the limitations of working in the White House is that you cannot focus only on one issue. You have the responsibility to focus on, on many. And one of the luxuries that I have now is the, the freedom to focus almost exclusively on the climate crisis and elements of the crises that are connected to the way our news media operates, the way our economic system operates. But I see it almost exclusively now through the lens of the climate crisis say and, and I think we, we have to make it the top priority.

Speaker 1:          12:08          I agree with you, but is that sort of a moot point? Unless there is sort of powerful legislation on an international level that pre prevent or prohibits profiteering by these monopoly utilities that you speak wouldn't affects, let the call crises of our planet and say well the way the oil is refined, the amount of profit these companies here, like you said, they're more heavily saturated. Like traditional energy resources are more heavily subsidized and modern renewable energy times as what do we make that legal overnight? Just like stop, stop subsidizing. It may go, I, it doesn't even require a kind of radicalism. Cause when I see these apocalyptic river, Lake Erie in the GS fires, storms, Filipino death, then I think, well it's not too much to ask to simply say right from the, forget 24 or 2050 or so. I'm a far flung title of a Kubrickian movie tomorrow. No more profit in. But these are not now. That's not possible. Is it? Because the political and economic model, which is in a way tissues is conjured by the consciousness of man will not permit it. You can't make those kinds of change. You can't say, well there's no more GM anymore. There's no Exxon Exxon's close reclaims it.

Speaker 2:          13:18          There was a famous economist who wants a, uh, things take longer to happen than you think they will. And then they happen much faster than you thought they could. And changes in consciousness sometimes take time, but they can occur. And this climate movement is very much in the tradition of previous movements that changed consciousness. The abolition of slavery, the granting of the right to vote to women, the civil rights movement. And in my country anti apartheid, most recently the gay rights movement, if someone had told me even five years ago that gay marriage would be legal in all 50 us states and would be accepted, honored and celebrated by two thirds of the American people, I would have said, I sure hope so, but I think you're being completely unrealistic. But the climate movement, like all these previous movements eventually gets to the point where the straw man or discarded and you see the central question, which is a choice between what is moral and right and what is immoral and wrong. And that's where we are right at that tipping point in the climate movement. Now

Speaker 1:          14:25          I hear you well, but prominent civil rights campaign. And one said to me like power will always yield on civil rights issues eventually because ultimately it doesn't affect their, their, their resources. But when you go for money, that's when you will face resistance now and, and, and it to be, um, Penika eight while I was there have been a huge success. He's in civil rights in the last half century. One don't have to spend too long on google to see that. Right now we're talking about something where there is a huge ticking clock, so I don't, I suppose it's not like I want to encourage his steria, but I sort of sense that radicalism is required and you in your new transcendent role to a role as a kind of global mench a bodhisattva of the climate movement. Oh, sort of uniquely positioned to spell out, just like pauses the film.

Speaker 1:          15:16          I watched it. I think, my God, this is a serious, serious crisis and you're educating people all over the world. You're doing a tremendous job. Who am I? I Amia celebrity to even question you on this subject, but my point is, is this a type of a, seems to me. My intuition is so the recession and trenching corruption within politics, the, the financial industry has these things sewn up so deeply. The ordinary people find this so hard to have purchased that in each of the issues that you have said, whether it's women's rights, African American rights, civil rights are partners, but blood is spilled. Great men are imprisoned, women die in chains before anything changes. Do we have this time with this apocalyptic issue? Do we not have to evoke the day it is in the demons? Do we not have to speak to level people on the level of their deepest, truest self about what kind of world they want to live in, what they're prepared to sacrifice, who they are prepared to confront and when,

Speaker 2:          16:06          no, I don't disagree with that at all. I think it is time for people to take action. Absolutely. And to uh, I'm very proud my daughter was arrested in a protest against the new natural gas pipeline network. So you know, times have changed when a parent says, oh I'm so proud of my daughter was arrested.

Speaker 1:          16:27          I am. What does that say about authority when a parent is now proud that authority, his challenge, he says all authority is de facto corrupt toe. No, Donald Trump really is it just a grotesque exagrid exaggeration as the proceeding decades and no disrespect, cause you took part in those administrations, but without [inaudible] and without a Bama, you don't get trump. We were being coached. We're being lubricated. We've been fluffed and prepared for the trump, for the trump thrust. I don't know what to call it, if phallic references seem somehow appropriate with that man. But, but like, you know, we've school, we told people to be individualists, we taught people to be materialistic and consumers. And now we're surprised when it's a selfish, racist, sexist precedent that leads the world. Well,

Speaker 2:          17:08          I, I would interpret that history differently from the way you do. I think that there are a lot of good people trapped in bed systems, but when you work for positive change, uh, sometimes there is a backlash. And I think that trump represents of backlash. I think that brexit represented of backlash. I think that for a lot of complex reasons, globalization, intelligence added to automation of the growth of inequality. There is a lot of unhappiness and unrest about the stagnation of middle income wages for some decades now. And the, and a demagogue can take advantage of that and focus it in an irresponsible way. But the next is of each and every one of those issues. Is it an economic system that will not yield power? You know, when we talk about, oh, how do we have this system is because the people that are dominant, this system works absolutely fine.

Speaker 2:          18:04          Thank you. We don't want to change it. We don't care if the planet is destroyed. We don't care if there is this, the, if there's economic inequality across the planet, I would see brexit and trump as if forgive my language as a democratic population and saying, fuck you to power. In both cases you've not looking after us. Why should we care? Why should we care? We've been taught that those limbs are different. We've been taught that women are inferior. We've been taught all this. Talk about gay people. Shepherd hit. People are bored of hearing it because they've said for decade after decade they've witnessed power, not com taking care of their interests. I think that's right. I think there are, I think this wave of populaced authoritarianism is a response to the unhappiness and anxiety that people have been feeling for quite some time, but how do we bring change in spite of economic interests posing it?

Speaker 2:          18:56          Take one example, the anti apartheid movement in South Africa. You're talking about an economic, a set of interests of posing that change. That was massive. Nelson Mandela said it's always impossible until it's done. Oh and this kind of change comes about sometimes when the potential for change bills up, pushing against a barrier that suddenly gives away and then you see a tremendous change that people did think was impossible but eventually came. Yes. I think there's a generational aspect of change as well. I think the younger generation now is far more committed to saving the climate than those in my generation and I think it's because they've seen that every night on the news is like a nature hike through the book of revelation and if the news media doesn't connect the dots, then they connect the dots themselves, they and their understanding that this change is essential. It does require a new way of thinking.

Speaker 2:          19:54          I absolutely agree with that. How do we bring that about or ranting and railing against? It has its place working within, and I'm not characterizing you that that way Russell. I myself have been characterized that way based on the film you ranting and railing guys think that has its place, but patiently working within the system as it exists to try to, you pull the levers and press the buttons and make the machinery operate in a more constructive way also has its place. But Owl, every one of these examples you give, I can't help but think of an alternative narrative. You know, Nelson Mandela, he went down for 27 years. He was prepared to kill and die for what he believed in. And ultimately I've think if we investigate it though the apartheid ended when the economic interests that were the benefit from a pied found a way of maneuvering so that they couldn't maintain their power

Speaker 1:          20:48          with our pod. And having been to South Africa relatively recently, I didn't fancy being black. They're much, you know what I mean? I didn't figure this would be a dotted line moving in and out of town shit, but there's of people are still living behind barb wire, you know. Now with all the way from my limited experience, it seems like what power does is what is the bare minimum we can give these people what is the bare minimum? So if we aim at bare minimum, that's what they'll give us. So for me it seems like what we should do is focus on radical annihilation overhaul and revolution and that way we might get some kind of parity, some kind of justice. So like, do you not think like I understand that rule changes happening. He know that solar power and renewable energies is better. You're right, you're 100% right. So like why not focus on identify the obstacles and then make it clear that these are the targets. Like these companies are the problems. That's what I tried to do. Attack.

Speaker 2:          21:42          That's exactly what I try to do is to focus

Speaker 1:          21:46          so on Koch brothers. Absolutely. So why, what, like why if you'd like a y con we have, right. Exxon now has to be nationalized. It's already subsidized. We were already paying for it. So now we're going to own it. Why can't you do that?

Speaker 2:          22:00          Uh, you know, part of the movie focuses on the investigation of Exxon Mobil that's now underway. I hope they will be held legally accountable for the fact that they have financed climate denial as the Koch brothers have financed climate denial. They, they've tried to fool people into thinking like rises isn't real and now they're trying to fool people into thinking that the renewable alternatives are not viable and real as well. It's very insidious.

Speaker 1:          22:27          Yeah. Stdz ncds and the consequence of it is, I suppose maybe a law. I am, I see the world differently. See, I recently became a father. I have a nine month old. Congratulations. Thank you man. It's changed everything. I'm so in love with her is incredible. What's her name? Mabel. I went for a walk over this morning in the fields near where we live. I look at the tree, I look at every time and I think about that. Our connection to nature is absolute. This is it. Like, and when you show the images you repeatedly do in your film an inconvenient sequel. Wishing I wasn't, you know, music, good title. In a way. It's sort of ironic. I like it. It's cool, but it's got the word convenient cause Mary at apple now vice vice metta, um, like it makes me feel that we, one has to nurture the inherent connection we have with this planet.

Speaker 1:          23:10          We have to personalize it. All things have become commodified is very difficult for people that are struggling to see the significance of broad global issues when globalization, whilst it is bought sort of a commodity revolution and we've all got wonderful phones. Thank you very much. They're delightful. What it's also done is this turned us into a planet of consumers that C, and this is why at the beginning of this interview I spoke about spirituality because I think this is where the transformation must take place. The way we regard the exterior world, the way that we regard God ourselves and our role on this planet as you evidently do as a servant. You are obviously living in service now and other feeling that I will let you know if I dare piece of boulders to speak for most people. I think most people think that politicians are corrupt, people in positions of power are untrustworthy and manipulative lawyers and that we should divorce ourselves from power and and I think to have a person in your position who has been behind the curtain who must know things that if you uttered them out loud, your life would be at risk.

Speaker 1:          24:14          To see a person like q embracing an issue in this way is very, very heartening for ordinary people. My hope is that we continue to aggressively pursue these issues and identify and target who the problem is aggressively. Oh, I agree. I agree. This is the time for for passion. This is the time for people to mobilize. I couldn't agree more. I wish we had to for longer vice president Al Gore, but I know there are many, many people to speak to a that you've got a an important and busy schedule. It's been really, really lovely to have you here. I respect you very much once. I bet you weren't man, the movie 340 theaters or this Friday and tickets are available at all of the places you get them and then a week from Friday it opens widely all across England. Uh, an inconvenient sequel. Truth to power guys.

Speaker 1:          25:07          See you'll probably get more from it then a go a lot. I watched it. I was really enjoyed him. He might feel guilty in popcorn like at certain points I might think, oh no, what am I doing with my life? But it's an optimistic film. You will learn from it. I endorse this film. I went and saw it. And normally you know how you have to infuse, interview someone important like you, they force you to watch the film normally got a guy in any way. Someone else watch it and tell me this one. I actually went and saw myself and I enjoyed it. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. And I like your relationship with your dog. I like your cowboy boots. I like, I like a lot of things about you. Alcohol or thank you for what you're doing for the world. Thank you for the interview.
