Speaker 1:          00:00:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       not under the skin with Russell brand. My guest today is Frankie Boyle. Frankie, I'm really, really happy to have you on the show. I love you a bit. I think I told you in our email exchange that I saw a sensitivity in you that much belied and contradicted your public persona even when you were sort of more [inaudible] than me in the public sphere. I thought there's something about that man is incredibly sensitive and tender, so this is a suppose and disarming introduction is what I'm doing I think. I think it's pretty close to see who's most of telephone from the head by head. Yeah. I know with both had our fair share. Heavenly of public vilification. How do you do, do you feel like that you, now that you're back on, I mean do you still consider yourself to be back in the mainstream television? Not me.

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       No, not taller. Considered myself to be like less secure than ever. What did you mean that emotionally and personally or professionally or both but also professionally you just sort of think the minute you're kind of out and doing stuff in a very can amend stream field, the minute you step out say what's acceptable, you would just be completely destroyed. So I feel like I'm kind of dancing on the edge of a cliff or bet you feel that day when you're doing something like the autopsy or tv autopsy your are you centering yourself? Cause I had it for example, that monologue you did about threes in May on in fact a cliff edge and the gail, I thought one of the things I've had, my bad, you're right in is the poetry and your succinctness it conjuring images that are humorous. I potent and I've sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       Oh that will stick. That'll bark people that that has been said about him but now you do you find, are you centering the saying you're dancing on a cliff edge, do you feel it was that self censorship? I don't do it, but like there does it for me usually and a out like writing for the Guardian as well. It just ended up being like a real horrific, just trying to get prey common or garden stuff in there because I think if the education can education system can uh, please select for conformity. You know, that idea that you know, by the time you reached the top in any institution, you've already gone through so many pre selections for your conformist while you fill in the test where you turn up to skill every day, that everybody's a conformist, where like sometimes in entertainment I think that can appease leg for neurosis. So like if you're kinda going through several peoples what he's about, what other people might think, and by the time you were scrapped riches and they're just kind of freaking out about nothing. Yes, I think you're right about that. But there is a degree of neuroses and indeed sensitivity that is deeply prohibitive. But there's so about like the

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       creative process that is, it requires like a connection to what you actually believe. When we were corresponding for a little while and email like I'm member, we talked briefly about the idea, like my somewhat more romantic idea of the comedian is shaman and like accessing new realms of consciousness. And you said something about, um, that there was something about that, about describing of a world that you felt was somewhat dangerous and that what needed to be done with the frosted describe accurately the world are actually in. Was that just the past in Forza philosophy? Philosophical mainstay? Yeah, totally.

Speaker 4:          00:03:34       I mean, I, I think there's, in some of the most interesting ideas, there's a lot of, um, there's a lot of danger isn't there? The, you know, shamanism and, um, particularly quite shamans. There's a lot of kind of, Eh, how'd you mean? There's that whole thing of like cultural erasure and stuff like that. And us just being at that as we see it at the top of some tree where every, every idea in existence is part of our mid board for our personal philosophy. Can, it dictates against them

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       the standard stuff. So do you mean white there as a synonym for power? That it was sort of like a there that we are, we are selecting for like all culture is a mood board from which were selected strands and obfuscating or ignoring their cultural origins.

Speaker 4:          00:04:19       Yeah. I almost think you don't need to use white as a synonym for power justice. It's a Nim. Yeah. Ah, yeah. I see this interesting thing with it at the minute and we're no, some people talking about Ah, you know, you don't, you're not white privilege doesn't really exist. You know what if you're, you know, a white guy who was born in this century action and all that kind of stuff and you think the thing about real oppression is those people don't need to fantasize. You know, if you really oppressed to that whole thing of like, you know, you get that from, from white people, particularly white people was a platform and they're sort of going, well, what if it's a paralyzed white guy and he works for Oprah? You know, you just know like, Whoa, if you know, if you were black, you wouldn't need to make a fantasy to have your depression. I know you would just go out on the weekend. I started the taxi, you know, I'm an empty white, white people come up with imaginary oppresses like the Illuminati and you know, we've got to, we've got to create something because we don't, we don't have it in the same way.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       Is your general worldview optimistic? Frankie? What's that happened to you after like working in media fire don't for maybe it's 15 years. Is it that you've been doing this kind of stuff like that it still feel positive and optimistic about change?

Speaker 4:          00:05:32       I think you solved domestic but most people heat in it would think it's incredibly depressing. It was mistake. I could lay it on you quick quickly. [inaudible] I think like um, maybe a whole reality is like a math for a and the materialism and commodification are mine. Keynes way of trying to express in metaphor the fact we are trapped in motto that we are sped. It now has to live in Martin and die and go through all that kind of stuff and perhaps the, perhaps the actual facts of life is we've constructed it. I simply sort of metaphoric responds to that. And there's some people may think that's incredibly depressing bias. I think of it like when I was a teacher, I did teach her training for bet. It was an alcoholic. I remember like seeing my arm writing on a chalkboard one day and thinking, Oh fuck, I'm a teacher, my teachers and I almost had an body experience and could see myself doing this thing that's, I've got to, I've got to go to this job. You know? And that's when I started doing comedy and I almost think, oh, metaphor of existence, materialism is sort unsurvivable that we have to go over it. That was sort of almost half to transcend mater. So I think that's a really positive thing.

Speaker 3:          00:06:44       Yes, yes, I understand. So in this sort of transcend ben or moment there at the chalkboard art teacher training, you add a pithany, which I've heard described as the revelation of essence. Suddenly the essence becomes plain tee. They all know that that's a teacher's arm. I'll know it's all. So Maya on where they are one and the same thing. I liked this idea, the on some level we are conscious that we are spirit traps in Matt and materialism is merely the metaphorical expression of this. One of the things that I get continually, um, what I want to say, frustrated by irritate by an almost, I'm on the, uh, on the precipice of a hysterical toddler tantrum about is that invoke comments. The left lacks a kind of mythic imagination that in opposing austerity there's a kind of an austerity of a room. I would want to say vision that it seems sometimes a little bit flat and a little bit droning the for me, if, if we're just talking about your transactions between bureaucracies and different type of imagination, then what is the point? I want some vivid, lucid dream. I want people to talk about different realms. I want basically to take Ios Iosk and experience machine elves dabbling with layers of reality, but I can't drink or take drugs. So I caught so it's no longer open to me.

Speaker 4:          00:08:04       Black. I agree. Birds, there's also this thing for, it's like sometimes that slightly humorless leftist thing also turns itself to critique. Oh the other people's attempts to find narratives and metaphors and things that resonate with people. So it's okay to be boring but to sit there and go, I didn't like that one. Well we don't just try it. I think metaphors can be incredibly powerful site in the 1968 riots in France. That was partly to do with society of the spectacle and get the ball and all his slogans were choked on the walls and stuff like that

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       just exploded because you do know a bit more about that cause I'm into that. I think that [inaudible] I'm into him cause he said one thing I read about him the other day was saying that the media and technology at south deeply corporatized the old data within it is necessarily imbued with, it's your agenda and you can see that in social media that even if people are sort of going, hey that's me in this square and riot, the an advert for trainers may very well accompany and the he's, he's procube age than the medium is prohibited by its origins and by its ownership.

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       So has it. Hazel was saying was like this bag, the cool, um, as you know, when it says just the site that you can escape the spectical so every ton, and even that's what we're doing, talk hummus is high in this back corner. Podcasters book ended by adverts. He would love that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:21       He signed that. They'd be, it's inescapable that our role while we're at work, we are workers when we're at home with consumers with designated roles that prevent us from having an authentic interaction with reality, an authentic experience of ourselves. So don't you like it? It's interesting for me to watch from the outside how your role at least externally just as a fan and a consumer of your work is like, it seemed like, oh, frankie boyle initially is this mood like sort of a fella. There's making shocking joke working class Scottish person making sort of pre, uh, would want to say, see hearing jokes, sacred cows to topics and all that. And that seems to be a reemergence of political commentary, uh, as a sensitivity and an a real depth of analysis and deep cultural understanding of you. On the gone, some sort of personal epiphany, or have you always been like this and just felt emboldened more recently to express yourself more truthfully?

Speaker 4:          00:10:15       Oh, I think I've always been like late us, but it's like you will never see little fragments of it slit most people, if we think about how we relate to things, so I was reading an article yesterday or start to read an article by Roger mcguinn turf. So, so regimen golfs on the Guardian website as I fucking hate vagifem of golf. And I started to redesign a call and I thought to myself, wait a minute, what should I actually been to this guy? And I think it seemed like reading some poems on a children's show 20 years ago, if I was totally honest with myself, just so dead. It isn't an intellectual exercise. I didn't like his glasses and he seemed a bit smug. That's sort of the level that most people relate to you. And to be honest, if you ask most people to relate to you more than that, you're a bit of an egotist and people are perfectly, it's perfectly fine that they can hear one joke they don't like and hear you. I'm quit don't with that. Right. But you know, I've always done like political stand up. It's just like people tend to take it one way or another. I don't see, you didn't choose whether his edits and they show the best thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:11       Wow. So you don't think that you have essentially change? Do you think you've been categorized and pieced together differently? There was a time where it was convenient there for, it was frankie boyle, shocking comic and now it's convenient because everyone's a bit more bruised and anxious to have frankie boyle voice of uh, the off authentic voice of the people.

Speaker 4:          00:11:29       Well, maybe I think everybody matures as bad, but there's, I mean there's also that thing of, I think I do tasteless stuff other than kind of like offensive stuff. So it's the idea of like the distinction. What would it, what would it be? Late we say civility because civility is a bit of a bore really now it's fine. That bet. When I first meet people of getting beyond the niceties to be Beva can a chore and then use it later. Passenger are you doing, you know, um, and I think in society we have that as well. But part of the problem is if you're a comedian and you've got working class background, you've got regional accent and you're dealing with tastelessness taste is a social marker. Is he cute? This is the main social marketing brand. So then immediately it's like, oh, you're just didn't fucking jokes and the Jimmy savile or you know, and you're like, well I'm not really, but that's all you can hear. And I'm sort of time Messiah. I don't really need the people who, who can get it to come to the shores.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       So you'll say, and again that that's about like forms of taxonomy. That is it, because like if you make a joke about Jimmy savile row in a particular accent, they won't be seen. Same way as if that, that same joke was made in a different accent where we are. This is interesting cultural critique review. It's just, oh, that's crass. And Bolga did you ever see them documentaries, Grayson Perry done about taste and class and it was actually exemplified brilliantly the point that you've just made because class is quiet class and taste. I suppose whilst they're systems of categorization, there's a tendency from be a bit or more first like, well he sort of said like, uh, you know, it was, it was a rough, you know, in some ways it was reductive, Barbara, but it was really articulate and clear for as far as I could see, like you been lucky in working class communities, uh, Welfare's exhibit it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:05       So like, you know, you get Larry Tattoos, Goldie loud, noisy cars where materialism has to be expressed because necessarily because of scarcity middleclass it gets sort of like, you know, it becomes more sophisticated. The coat and the signals become more discreet. It was talking to interior design, fashion, all of those things. And then you send an f class. People were just like, dress like I'll ratbags new motto of Tech. Like he was sort of like a polo mattress. I make everyone come in some bad old Volvo or Jim Morris miners with bits of wood on them and like, you know, they were proper, proper loaded. And if I see an interesting that, cause what you know, that taste is sort of the art of the every day, the stuff that you're wearing, the way that you decorate your house. Hey, a great story. He went around and he's like working costs woman's house and it was like, Oh look a these horse brassieres and this poor things I need. It was a very goldie and elegant, beautiful. So kitsch display of taste. And if anybody was interesting how it was an almost exact like how you could move, oh this is an interesting marker. This is real. You can use it as a barometer is legitimize me is genuine. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       Yeah. I mean I that's interesting. Must Watch that. Um, I think is w as well. There's a kind of further stage two, which is if you middle class, the only the only people who can really impress other people with purchasing power or really poor people and really rich people. You know as if you really pair, you get a nice car and if you really brought you get and your and your, your social group or impressed. If you middle class people would pretty much, you know, in a place where they can only express themselves through the test. So you taste becomes incredibly important. And I think when you align that with the fact that we didn't necessarily, but it's very difficult to live morally. So if my taxes are going to bomb sedia tomorrow, if my taxes are going to lakeview slide front page of the times to the nacs death squad, you know how you I live a moral life or maybe it's to my tastes.

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       You may want to pay lower taxes, but how on earth are we to fund our sas? That's exactly what you want. Correct. Sas Dead Scott. No, you're right. Good. I do a fair enough. You're quite right now, but I wonder how that relates to what you were saying about materialism and an endless commodification and the fact that you know, like you're right, we sit here and we make this pot of podcasts now. Autodidacts though we may be, we're evidently adept at pontificating and doing it as you know, in some cases on some occasions though, not this one for a hunt, some living here by like where, where is it that, where are you resourcing your sense of purpose now? What is it that you won? What is it that you want to do as a comic? Cause like, uh, one of the things is I still believe in, I do believe in the possibility of change. I believe in a evangelist sees him. I believe that you can enthuse people probably in ways that a rather dangerous. In fact, when I was just interview Noemi Klein there, she went, you're this part of bloody problem. Yeah. You Miss Lunatic.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       Well I said, I think I was struck by this thing at rate and a grant, Morrison comic musical one good mine can make a difference. Was it just the end of the story archive. So I don't think I'm trying to evangelize to people in general. It's just that thing of if you do something and test in that has meaning to, it can be that one person I could not watch and things like Alex Cox is say video or maybe drama or whatever you called it. What did he just show his favorite movies and BBC two but she wouldn't even get that kind of thing now. But like just just things like that had a big impact on how I see the world, you know? And if you can change how one person sees the white old not might've been off

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       I suppose. So I mean if we don't really understand the true nature of being there so or off the manifest world, I'm I suppose to sort of even to suggest that there is a global narrative that we can interact with an intersect with Ralph for them. Sort of endless, infinite subjectivities, all tangled up and occasional narrative. Fritz memetically sleeping across the Internet. But I don't know. I suppose like when you find it, you know when you get an interview bio and Jones, a person who has a much clearer, I like, I like, I mean and like I said, have a clearer idea of narrative to sort of a traditional idea. In terms of respect of the left, how do you think like someone like you that's talking about talking about the spectacle took her out in the nature of consciousness, talking about that sort of like, sometimes you sound a little bit nihilistic if I may say so. I think nihilism is quite a positive thing is it? Yeah, go on.

Speaker 4:          00:17:20       Starts off is like existential nihilism of going well. You know, there's, there's nothing else you might as well make. This is as good as you can, you know? So it's a kind of a branch or existential ism. Originally I think it's only since the 90s whatever that people have started to see it as a death cult.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       Hmm. Because it becomes a bit decadent and had any stick, oh well there's no purpose. Why as we'll stick this out and Obama and kick that falls over.

Speaker 4:          00:17:41       Yeah. I think as well, you have to be careful about saying, let's have a narrative and let's have a, a thing where we, this is a thing we're like, Eh, Alan Mirror the comic book rate, I'll talks about m r is propaganda for a state of mind is really [inaudible] cool. Yeah, it's cool. But at the same time you've got to be careful with that because who do you propagandize too? You don't propagandize Tutti calls. It's not persuasion. It places you in a [inaudible] of a week and a design a narrative that you know, poor people are going to fan too. And this is gonna make the world bear. And the thing with that is people can see it if you don't, if you don't approach it from a possession of equality and going, well, how can I help? Then you know, you're, you're suddenly putting yourself in a hierarchical possession of hey, that create a story that's going to work, which is what most political parties are doing and what most really politically motivated commentators are doing. And I always, I think people see that. People see that you're trying politicize things.

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       I say I'm a bit grandiose of course. So like I'm always thinking, oh, I've got some letter about like, I don't know Frankie, if it feels like it's an essential part of me, I say sometimes to my counselor. Like I know it's much of what I do is driven by ego. I know it is, but it's not only that, there's something else there is, I admit that there's the ego. I admit it. There's the grandiosity I've met, I want the adulation. And in the past I wanted this more audit, uh, all vs anatomical manifestations, carnal manifestations. But like all of, of all of these, I have now been stripped, stripped, and landed in domestic city and don't think I've ever been happier than being a father and a partner in a recognizable sort of way, but still this yearning. But it seems to me to be not perhaps these systems of categorization and these delineations are also arbitrary, but seems to be more than he goes. Super Ego, Ego plus something of the mistake, something of the magical, something that I'm still craving.

Speaker 4:          00:19:40       I think you'd find this reductive or nihilistic, but it's not, I think this is a good thing, you know, like David Eick cool side too, right? So like David Dykes, so beer in a minute. Do you know you need things like, because a lot of people are less, it's a lot of various people in power and sort of country western singers for somebody who's in our lessons, right? I see. Like David dykes kind of like a religious figure. So he's like a guy who's had a religious experience, but it's a goalkeeper. Right? So you can, he frames it in a particular way. I'm an, it's kind of like the guy who wrote the Bible has to believe the metaphor is real. Yeah. So like that's why it has its power of David date has to believe like the, not ramp tales, but it's a good way of thinking of them because they'd behave like red tail.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       That's right. And he does have to, as you say, because I like you, you've met everyday, like haven't you? Yeah. Yeah. We, we, I, I've named several times and I, you know, I'm obviously fascinated by David dike. There's that, like, I so much voices, I mean he preempted to hold off the off the knee like zones of things that he said we're going to happen. It's not, not, there's not mince words, pedophile rings, you know, like David, I've said this all be it within the entertainment industry. That's he swept paid. If I run it, it runs deep people in children's homes right now. But yeah, admittedly that was book ended with a love of lovely stuff about lizards. But like I agree with what you're saying is that he's almost like unconscious metaphor labor. Cause because David Eick you've pushed, we've got, no, it's funny,

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       but see, I think that maybe the messianic thing isn't that, so you have to understand that as a kind of, oh I can totally change the world by doing this, but to have an actual effect on whatever as a few thousand people that you energize. Like you have to believe that to be true.

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       Like A, like a like go see if Hitler suddenly had there sort of a moment of going, oh no, this is mental. I'm not Hitler. It'd be meant to be metaphorical. He's like, no. Can you see the death camp that they are a bridge too far for you? Come for all tying. Let Nick Crow politics played to kill it. We've built one. Oh No, no, but perhaps he had a frankie boyle moment of looking at his own sieg heiling hand and like you writing on a chalkboard. I haven't hit La. What have I done to myself? You have to believe them. You know? Do you have to take the metaphor out of it? It has to be absolute and real. Yeah, we're not, we're not sure. We spoke to David [inaudible]. I am loved so many of the stories and I love, like some of them are well vivid. If you read some of the ones where it's like Hillary Clinton and going down on someone and all of this, can you fit? Oh Man. Y'All could go in for this stuff. You rental it. The Queen

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       Mother tongue isn't at giant [inaudible] laser. [inaudible] there's one that what she like changes in the SPEC quite lizards and stabs the kid up the arse. Oh. And it's like just to start over chat,

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       go from there. Where are you going to go? Never explained, never complained and had that same catch phrase. The Queen Mum never apologize. Never explained or something like that. Right. Well surely you should after you've taken it. What? Bloody Great John Elvino Lizard and bumped someone. Particularly if it's an underage person you couldn't possibly have consented mom. Yeah. Lucky had some rich to some rich, rich stuff in there. Some interesting things. What did it come in and what else did you, what did you think when you met him?

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       And I was like in Portsmith and you've just seems like a pretty normal dead, but there's definitely my ad fan had kindergarten backstage. A Ne was like talking to me and like David Aic was stuck behind them in the corridor looking at me like this bloke's and nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       Let's get away from this Weirdo right now. Then the queen mum bombed another kid. She was a phoenix. That's one. Like, I'm, yeah, well I've found fascinating is as like, you know, as I say this like, I wouldn't like to be mean about David. I was just, it's so colorful. Some of this imagery that like when I'm him, I was just surprised by actually quite how, how sort of ordinary, he was almost some drum members that we watched football with him and we went out of the white right. And like, I think it was like a FAA Cup games to sort of like a couple of championship level teams and him and his, no,

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       no, no. They need to be playing a bit wider and so Saturday drinking tea and being sort of very ordinary while sat on this, uh, you know, this sort of great volcano of lucid imagery and powerful mythology. I think it's like the mundane is hugely underrated because like, they've got stuff to sell us all the time. Um, but, you know, imagine how much better

Speaker 4:          00:24:10       honey part would be, uh, a comprehensive, you know, if it was just a bad kid, then his teacher, how many get a bus to the edge of town to face some demons or some stuff. I had just all been a real chore

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       and then having to top up their oyster cards are much better. You think that he in the ordinary, in the real, there could be somehow more potency. There's really good. Then those children's books. Um, Alan Gardner, wheatstone of pressing almond and nine my right, there's a trilogy in it. So first one is called [inaudible] and they're all, but he's, um, children, a brother and sister who are fighting against this watch. Um, and you know, the go through the old maths, can I say calls Colin? Challenges like that and it, and then he'd rates a sod one like of, it's 30 years later, just before he dies. And it's like the boy grown up going to his therapist and he's not able to really remember any of it and they just think he was like nuts as a kid and his sister disappears at the end of the second book, famous watch.

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       And he just never really finds out whether she dead there, whether she does or if he's just lost his mind. It sort of normalizes it and it was great. It was really good. Oh, I'm going to check those out. I liked that Frankie. All right, so let me think about it because I spent out a little bit while we were talking about I can, uh, became a bit untethered from myself. So one of the things I had to talk to you about, like on sort of a, perhaps a more or ordinary level, these moments of disruption that we seem to be experiencing that they're sort of, uh, uh, the terrorism, the Grenfell Tower, which you spoke to own Jones about like, uh, what do you, what do you think is revealed by these events? What do you think is becoming a parent? What is becoming manifest? And it's been previously concealed.

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       I think people are more widely recognized and just high letell. This system that is supposed to nominally care for them can't even be bothered to pretend. And for some reason there seems to be a deference between a government is supposed to pretend to care and a government that can't even be bothered to pretend the care, you know? So the idea that the grand for residents got their rent, the doctored this month for example, you know the idea they could, they tried to throw them out of their hotel, you know, they're in a holiday inn somewhere and they tried to split them all up and, and, and also there's a can immediate lag. There isn't no. So they don't know that. They can't get away with that anymore. In the days of social media. They don't know that they can have a council meeting. There isn't film the all because everybody's got a camera now, you know. So there's, there's a, there's two things and I think, which is like social media for which alone for a long time is seem to be like quick can it depressing seesaw of good and bad. I seems to be like a net gain in protest movements. Um, and, and just also the fact that we are really in classes or are way more out of touch than we'd imagined.

Speaker 3:          00:27:07       Yes. I see. So they sit in a way is like, is it s a revelationary symbol of joy that that brings together numerous Fred's this connection, total lack of concern. And then the unawareness in fact of how quickly things get changed. I fought, one of the things that was notable, uh, struck me was the, on the black sort of a Monday or whenever our, after the fire Jeremy Corbyn was on tv going, you know, repossess ours is give them luxury flat. And that would have been a couple of years ago that would be mental and visible. And then by Thursday, Friday, that's what's happening. So there is it almost that there is a, there is a necessity to respond to a different kind of uh,

Speaker 4:          00:27:49       discourse. It's also just like how it's almost novelistic, I mean it's how can have cartoonish and the whole thing has been so at the head of housing, m Kensington and Chelsea, Eh, council is a guy called rock fielding mail and it's going to stay down. But he's like part of this like honesty, cratic family who his mother is some kind of modeled happy who ran a couple of times and for this party called tree panning for the national health and try and persuade everyone to like tree pine themselves to drill a hole over here. The drill to hell in a hand to help you relax. Yeah. So she's good taste sons. One is rock fielding melon. The can a straight Arrow and then there's cause cause it, cosmo fielding malins done several documentaries about acids and they live in this like Jacobean Mansion. Right? And it has the Breton or maybe the world's largest gravity phone, tim. So it has literally this enormous 300 feet high powerful jet of water shooting up like 24 hours a day. The one thing that could have extinguished is in the grains of has an ancestral home.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       If only there was some way, some way to control the confrontation, one eyed man would've needed something absurd like a gravity defying press conference over the solution was laying about in their garden. And the the straight Arrow is the one that's called rock melon rock fielding Mellon. Amazing. Amazing. So yes, there's, it's interesting when you talked before about like perhaps materialism and commodification being some extraordinary metaphor for ourselves, understanding that we are spirit trapped in matter because more and more I'm seeing a kind of dumb poetry in current affairs. Like so if we're emblems such as the tower itself and then sort of Ludicrous sub narratives about fountain is in the garden as if somehow now the is appearing

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       just beneath the veneer of superficial reality. But something ulterior is trying to realize itself, some dreadful beasts slouching towards Bethlehem to be born, but that is there some optimism in this lucky in, in events like this on a sort of, I don't know frankly this deep into the conversation, but on a practical level, do you think that this could precipitate change? Absolutely. And there's loads of things to be positive about. Look at the incompetence of your enemies. Look at like the tardy carbonate, like something make or fallen. I can of living side I sent out to just sort of saw cup shrapnel or something and he's just, you know, tied onto a bus and driven at the media. May Cook Golf. Um, borders is like there. I mean they're just, they're just saying, who do we, can we replace this in competent cunt with a massive cunt?

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       And all we can do is I can see that there's cause for optimism there. What about you on a personal level? How has it been you, you all right it happy in there. You've got love in your life and children and stuff. Hey, I've got children I've been doing in London doing this TV show on BBC two so I'm just like, I'm messing my kids at the moment and feeling about like how much longer can I do this? How long have you had to do so far I've been here for like months. Oh really? What does it, it makes you feel what? A little bit disconnected. Yeah. And also it just makes, I think it makes you write in a bit kind of automatic cars instead of like, you know, Oh I really want to say something about the subject. You're kind of going to, I need 10 jokes for this week to try and get through this thing and get back home.

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       Yes. I say it breaks your relationship or fucking be grand for a moment. With the idea of the mute. My life has changed a lot, you know, like sort of, I felt like when before I would just the philandering womanizing, like sort of professional, loose cannon person, there was sort of no consequence. There was a kind of delicious rootlessness accompany though. It was with a deep sense of personal despair. Over the intervening when we, a hotel I was in would immediately turn into sort of a barren multistory car park bereft of all life bereft of all light. It was just the trail of underwear traipsing out of the door now like they, you know, this era is over and I live in, I mean people I have peace and harmony and love and all these things that I sort of never like in it. For me, family was a kind of, uh, an idea that was nervous about because of what the connotations that word had because of the one that I've grown up with, you know, and now I'm learning a kind of a new way of living and one. How'd you, how'd you feel to them and does that take you away from that? I don't like when I, if I go like I'm doing like touring in an intelligent way, right? I do like so free shows a week

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and like if I have to stay away, my girlfriend and my baby and my dog, all of us go up in a car like traveling. People might as well have a banjo like we were sort of like yeah it's a really good way of doing it because the center, the nucleus of my life has moved from this kind of limitless. We sort of like driven kind of performance ego goal or they was upset to you already. That in itself has been in a woven with other stuff to oh no I have a home. I'm a person. I'm a

Speaker 4:          00:33:10       great if you can do that man cause I've just had to stop to them cause I did a 50 date to it or something last time. I just couldn't handle it. It's too much

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       aren't you? Were away a lot. And what happened to you

Speaker 4:          00:33:19       as she used to weigh too much and there's also like you know the thing you get at the moment, there's a lot of criticism of comedians about Oh you, you want comedy to be a protected space and a special place where you can see nsn and use. I think it's the fun, this space away from that in the world. I mean if I could just stop them fucking yelling or trying to claim on this stage are lik explosive sales. However, do you know the idea that we have this aspirational idea of it's a protected space, you know, just cause you need to think that when you're writing but in practice, you know, standing up on afraid and I in Blackburn to people who've been drinking him and he stopped drinking it like fucking five o'clock. Oh you and your protected space.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       Yes. I see. And that as a, aside from that you find it personally difficult. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:34:08       D M yeah. Just find it really hard being away from home for the amount of time. And also, I mean I like the [inaudible] tif didn't stand up so you write a joke, he'd go and try it works is in the shore. But the idea of then taking that shore and like a hundred times, I mean as it gets less relevant to you in them. I can't, I'm never doing it again, I don't think.

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       Wow. Really? He didn't think could do it again. No. My technique, I think he's all right. This is three days a week thing. I was here. I see how it goes now. I read both of your biographical books or other thing your brother said like, uh, you're always going to be worried about something. Even when you're, like I said, always be worried about something. You're worried about something. And even if that thing goes okay, there'll be a new worry. So basically you're always do white about some things. I didn't like that thought very much and I've had it myself.

Speaker 4:          00:34:56       Yeah. A hierarchy of like what is that we have and all we ever really was replace the one at the top. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       Yes. Yes. This is jostling league table of angst. Do you have some kind of like have you do think that that sort of dynamic of you already life, which seems to have pretty fraught to me. So it sounded like it's quite difficult and obviously you were an alcoholic for a while or is it the uh, in, in, in this of pop popular style understanding of the condition will remain one like that. You don't drink no more tech drugs of any kind. No, I don't do anything. No. Yeah, me neither. And let's say like, what do you like, how do you find solace? Have you got some sort of spiritual program or something? No. African across a decadent to work across the Dixon can catch about your

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       work. I, I don't really get obsessive about it, but I just do too much or it did more than makes me happy.

Speaker 4:          00:35:44       Just that part of that can a Catholic guilt thing of, oh, that's good. Am I happy? No, it did so much. Might not be that's, that's what it, who's supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       Yes. All right. Do you know what you mean by that? I didn't know how you got lack of vision for what you want to do. Does it, do you see yourself becoming more involved in like more directly involved in activism? Do you see yourself ever wanting to be in a position of any authority or power? Does that idea sort of soup simply be unpleasant here?

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       Oh No, it seems incredibly unpleasant. Uh, you've heard that thing? Um, the once and future king t h wait, no, but I mean it's like there's Keds Berkey but king asa, but it's like, it seemed as a 12 year olds or something. That's where they took him, the sod and this door and Cuttin from and kind of where they took monty python and the holy grail they expect from it as well. But it's all access. There's fairly jolly can a kid's book Cubo Eh, you know, young arts and meet Marilyn and they, they, you know, the spins and fork stands on a table and all that kind of stuff. And then a few chapters, then we start to get bit darker in Maryland. Tons. I'm into fashion consumer lives lake, it's a fashion, he swims around in the mall and he meets this peak and the peak does this speech about power and it goes like a love is just an evolutionary track and their pleasures the same. All the rides, his power and he does this free speech. Right. And as I can remember reading that like 12 or something. But it's just that, I mean that's the assessment that's going on and people that want power of wellness is all their ads control.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       Do you believe that? Still the, that pike saying that there's only one emotion and love. I don't believe it. I reject it completely. You believe in love? Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah, me and not believe in love. Right. I remember

Speaker 4:          00:37:30       planes, my son one day and he was, he was pissed off a bone and he was like, Oh, you know, you don't even like me do you? Or something like that. It's, we're going to bed. And I was like, he to step in front of the bill it for you. And he was like, why?

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       He was just like this what it is very little cat. He's maybe three or four at the time. And you try and explain that or impact that. Tim is very difficult. We're really didn't have an intuitive understanding of that. You think of overwhelming love? I don't think they do. I mean I think Ted's are quite, um, it depends on your bra I suppose. But selfish little bastards didn't know. Like this one I've got, it's only seven months old. At least just I, I'm diluting it will. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, I mean, and they have that. They're really centered on themselves for the first few years aren't there and then that's like that. I think it would kill me for amusement. I don't think there's, I mean she's glorious and so beautiful and it's caused me to plumb new fathoms of love within myself. But in return I have received little butt grabbed chest hair and

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       hair,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       but I think the best thing in my life is that important. I'm uses my son the most, is some misfortune be falling me in margin in me, frustrated. Then I'm stuck in some place. It's like, what? What he finds funniest too. Anytime anything bad happens I think with, I tell him this, I mean he's going to kill himself. Oh, he loves it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:38:57       He loves nothing more than to hear you being trounced. One of them things that you hadn't started. Fuck. He said when he come in here that bloody Yanis Varoufakis he came in here. Tell us about the dynamics of path and you're, hey guys, I'm like, those people, they've got no power. There were there, I've only got power within their systemic role. Like even somebody said like wolf gang shall by the German chancellor. He said out loud to that Yanis Varoufakis democracies. Right. As long as you don't change anything. And he was not ever being ironic nor dismissive or anything. He just was state in some data, democracies are right. As long as it doesn't change anything and that, that he within like the, the, it was sort of like you answer a fuck, he said from his flirtation, we've actual power structures that people were in, it would just inhabit in particular roles. And these were these, they knew that. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:39:38       Yeah. I think we make the mistake sometimes of going on from that obviously knows a lot more than me, but I think I sometimes think we made the mistake of going on. So the real power, it's somewhere else. The real powers that Ross child's or wherever, and the real power is the system, you know, the real parents systemic is within the institutions, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       Yeah. Well, so you mean it is not a human power, it's sort of superhuman or on the human? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:00       Yeah. It's like corporations, you know, that idea of, oh, we're going to make corporations liable for things you can, there's a blueprints for making money. You need to look at ways of reducing their power, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:40:11       Yeah. That is actually one of the things that has come up from talking to people. Let you know these, you know, the s and the Yanis Varoufakis and name and now yourself is that as long as they are there, as long as they are our hubs of power, centralized power, it's always going to behave according to the motif of that pipe. It's always going to perpetuate and sustain itself. So the only way of changing it is to dismantle it even like it. So I do think that in like on a personal level, are you willing to make big sacrifice? Do you think the Andy and do you think that people genuinely generally are?

Speaker 4:          00:40:47       I mean, I don't think I need to. I think it's like there's this, there's, there's a kind of equal to that. You know, I like that whole thing of lake. I saw a documentary once to build that habit, edge general, all gays who pin on rocks and they see something that's really all, it might be a thousand years old. And I go, oh, I'll just redo the eye, you know? And this researcher was seen it, one of them I want you to not for, you know, let's say and I'm antique essentially. And the guy's like, no we don't just part of the same gate in hand that does this. And I think if you think of yourself as oh I'm doing the eye, it's much healthier for you than going, I'm going to create this thing that lasts for 2000 years. Do you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       Well it's a very wise, very wise soul there sat there. Frankie, what was that thing I was thinking about everyday you might like here it is. What's thinking about them Amanda? Laws like in other people take ages and ages to manufacturer them, right? Like, you know, sort of sit there ages than they are with the sand and it's bull lake takes a week and then they just sweep it up. And like obviously like me as a person that's likes permanence, like oh no, no, don't, that was brilliant. Fuck. But of course the pop point of it is Dean Jews. That feeling cause you can lose your own body yourself. Everything's gonna fall apart. [inaudible] kind old coat that poem you again. But that even a thing like Michelangelo's David, it's just a temporary thing. The moment we'll come with, you know, so whatever death cult looms up out of Christianity, if, uh, if the, if the right demographic becomes poor enough, if they rise up against idolatry, chisel in hand to decide to smash away the renaissance in the Isis inspired frenzy.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Like you know, that the Michelangelo's David is on its way to destruction and deterioration as all of our individual bodies are on their way to destruction and deterioration and this sort of sense of oneness. This idea that this aboriginal aborigine exhibit eight in our bad just duty, I, that's a no, no revere. The deer on the rock. That's that that is a better type of connection. But that, but that idea of a sort of an an it did indigenous connection beyond our individual understanding of time and space. It's bloody hard to get that out. There isn't, it may, I mean, but that's not how people are really looking at the world.

Speaker 4:          00:42:49       Yeah. I mean it is incredibly hard. I think there's always that thing where like I was quite interested in this idea for awhile. Culture is like every resistance to civilization. Do you ever had that? Yeah. So it's like this isn't my idea, but it's like the idea is that what we call coach for now is kind of comes up in the time of like Fredric [inaudible] in Germany and it's sort of for, for what became Germany and it's kind of to resist the French idea of several eyes and through institutions. So you know, France has all these different academies of the arts and so on. And that partly that was a kind of soft power way of making everything very French, you know, and culture can arise is up to [inaudible] and I kind of think we're in a kind of late stage in that know where part of our problem is we work within institutions, try and produce culture.

Speaker 4:          00:43:38       So the reason it's difficult to do a stand show on the BBC is that the comedy clubs, part of the reason comedy clubs exist is to resist things like the BBC. Mr, go on. Have you seen that? Fucking sure you know that part of the, that's part of the reason for them, you know? So, so where do you go from there? I mean, do you democratize institutions or do you try and dry the clothes institutions in some way or make them more representative or something? But it seems like, you know, we'd all stuck in some sense within institutions that are kind of Pristina's

Speaker 3:          00:44:13       yes. As oppose. So a ref to refer back to that idea that this, we have ourselves become institutionalized. Who is thinking our thought? Who is prescribing the stories? What is it that I'm thinking of when I'm thinking of myself? One of the things in our email correspondence you talked about was, I can't remember the correct words, but you talked about the idea of language being a sort of an effective agent of virus in the mind. Talk me through that again. I like that.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       That's nice. Here's my idea. So the idea is like Kim, Eh, you know what kit toxoplasmosis is a disease that cats or catch it gives to mace and it clears tiny little scars in and may spins, Eh, that never heal the, makes them nice, behave in an uninhibited way. So Eh, when they're on inhabited, they're more likely to be caught by the car. Sort of like toxoplasmosis has a podocyte seat. Brainpower piracy performs a function of changing behavior to mace. What if language is that for humanity? So what if language has been seated here to make us behave, maybe just behave loader so that we can be phoned and consumed by some cosmic entity or maybe it's simply something that's watch and it makes us more amusing. The fact that we're able to relate through language. Is it really

Speaker 3:          00:45:34       beautiful and extraordinary idea? I like the point of origin that cat shit, cavalier mice, but they go fucking the shit that makes my submit. Cocksure buccaneer yeah, the live fast die young mice population. And you think that language could is this is really sort of a quiet, beautiful, beautifully complex idea. This isn't an occupying force because what is it manifesting all his metaphor, all this symbol, what is being expressed? I mean, I suppose it, it denies the supposition that language is a reference to some deeper essential self. It's, it's, it's, it is. It's own vessel made a minute done. If we get into trouble with trump's skin linguistics anywhere along the way. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:16       I think Chomsky be on our side on that thing turns Mckenna and bill for it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       Terence Mckenna and nice, great pioneers of DMT and Iowaska. That'd be well up for it. But chompsky I mean he's a, he, he seems quite dour at the best of the Times. [inaudible] I like, uh, yeah. Well Russell, Frankie, I don't think that that's of plausible at all. Like, if the ice suck, you suck my life out at deal. Oh No. Oh No. What was my other thing there? Okay. This is interesting. I think he might bring me to the precipice of my awareness. So think like, cause I never lose the tendrils and threads that are required. Oh yeah. Iowaska and DMT Doni above you as a person in sobriety and recovery, whoever is you determine your abstinent lifestyle edge that you can't take our WESCO cause like you referenced Terence Mckenna there that grow cosmonaut of the brain. Like I listened to those. I watch youtube seems to borderline fetishistic Stickley of people talking about, you know like the describing their journeys on dmt and DMT even more than Ios guy because you smoke in, it's such an obvious black crack as a hallucinogen, but I think, Oh God, I can't get away with that. I can't sell my cell phone. No, I'm only doing this for spiritual reasons of research. If I find myself with a pipe in my hand fast, no good look. Yeah. So like are you not fascinated by having the, some of these metaphors made literal?

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       I'm fascinated if you've ever read the breaking open the head Daniel Pinchbeck. Yeah, I liked Daniel Pinchbeck. I know him. Do you know what is, I'm second bit was called go on. I am quit so quarter. So he did all this for me that don't know. He did other stuff. Like we experimented with drugs and he's a really good book. He talks about, you know what it's like to take hold of various, can I listen to tunes? But like by the second one he saw, he was in Mexican guides quiz who quartile

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       he crazy cold, some feathered serpent and some inter dimensional traveler scarf. Good job. I took all these drugs actually cause I've discovered up quick. It's a cot. Oldest a separate thing. You don't think that was the drugs? It wasn't quite the court took the drugs I'm good at. Yeah. There's the drive sometime self in the critical using drugs. Um, but like this for me there's something beautiful about this mystery in the it people have archetypal experiences. Well I find that exciting when it works. That terence Mckenna stuff, he's holding a minute people to drop in its acid and their flood plot of plunging inward into inner myths and the truths and this syntheses is that the word we'd like different sense. He's representing themselves in sort of different media like you're able to see visually the zeitgeists trends. For me that's a sort of a, that image matrix suggest to me that my own consciousness is such a tiny aperture of a total consciousness. It makes me start remembering my own experiences and I said, and it makes you want to do it more.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       Yeah. There's something to be said for that wipeys. We get older, we won't care. Yeah, because we like as the material form disintegrate, you'll stuffing out of might as well just like dive within, let it fall apart. I knew this girl, he was on acid every day for a year as a waitress and she was obviously having a bad time and eventually she said to the people running the restaurant, look, I've been on like a heavy dose of acid every day, and they were like, you know, I'm going to leave. I'm going to go get therapy, whatever. And they're like, don't leave. You're like the best.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       Come on just for your brilliant. Tell us more about that winged serpent thing that you are. Yeah, lots of it didn't affect her job as well because like acid, like the first time I sort of heard of it was like people at school with them in it and how can you do score and it's like, cause I didn't take it to a couple of years. I was like 18 first time I took it and forgot you can't do this and school like oh but everything just completely shut down my whole reality shutdown of love because my sense of self, I remember that like in my 18 year old understanding of what reality was realizing oh no, there is no such thing as self. This is just a composite of biography and biochemical data and it probably wouldn't have known where it's like biochemical data. But I remember feeling that.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       I remember looking at my own anatomy. Allah, you and Hitler not done saying good. The same thing like I, I'm thinking these hands, what is this occupant force? What is this energy? That's not my thinking but is, is, is my consciousness and my anatomical awareness. But there seems me that there is some truth in that. Some truth in being able to uh, add, transcend my conventional ideas of self and like that sometimes a material life with its prescription. It's not that I don't feel wonderful. Moms are transcendent love, such as with my little kid and even decide the l May, I just went on a bar, drove that day for 24 hours and a fought God. Life can be so different. I'm a man on a barge. Obviously I can work. The bar's probably so I have to keep getting out and why he didn't through shallow waters.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       You're not mean it though, but it seemed like such a renunciation of ordinariness for me to be this bloke on a boat with a family as much as it was to be a dad in a loft, putting the crib up there when a baby got too big for it. I'm at that dinner loft. I'm at that dinner loft. I'm a man on the board. There was blood. The Indian now go to normally around the corner. I've called up and got Indian from the place. I always get it. Life hadn't changed that Marshall wouldn't, we weren't dances with bloody wolves, but it just made me realize this life I'm living, this is not it. This is a selection. This is a confection. I'm the curator of this reality. I'm not like a promethium and trapped in a sick. He'll call moment. I kind of any moment abandoned all this. I remember once you have a girlfriend going to like, she goes, no, y'all don't like the way you do that because, well listen, let me know because I can let go of any of this shit for you. None of this is real. I was just flung this together on the off to get myself out of where I was to where I wanted to go. Let me know what you don't like this gone. So I've been absolutely denounced the ECENTRA south.

Speaker 4:          00:51:49       That's great man. You're not bow hex thing about um, Eh, we all one consciousness experience in itself subject.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       Well, yeah, I keep wanting to say it and then by every time I go to say it on the stage before big Cavaday, I don't say that Russell, that's Bill Hicks. I'm actually just say that now because that is one of your favorite bill Hicks space. But he's like, because it's so true. I keep arriving at it while like while riffing,

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       it hangs above my, a toilet in my bedroom. Picture poet x. But that cool. This is live at my publisher gave me is what he would do his point. He would have one too. Have you ever told you that thing? A bit. Gay told me I should go hex for these invasive but comedy, no, go on. So it was like, call me. Do you know Tom Rhodes? No, he's not an American guy who I met bizarrely on nine 11 and our Gig got canceled or in Dublin, but eh, Tom and wrong. I choose when he did it off. Now I'm that, but we were there. Um, eh. He said, Eh, he met biohacks when he was blake plainly the texts they suck or whatever he was at the time when he was like a really young guy and he's, he pastored bell hacks for his advice over a couple of nights and biohacks hex eventually said, look, if you want to notice decrees, always be nice to the new guy.

Speaker 4:          00:53:03       And for a few years I thought, oh, he's having a joke, Tom, you know he's going to in the new guy, pester me and I'm being nice by fobbing you off with us. But now I kinda think in this better have been now, but engineer working on the eye that has kind of a bike that is realizing that you are not the be all and end all. There's the next generation along from that and the next generation along for my, and you're just, you're just filling in a little, you know, stuff on this stone. Is it powerful? Is Transcendent id just so together the aboriginal, I have a beautiful Bill Hicks story and if punctured, just for a moment, my narcissism, but hold on, I'll get it back. Wait a minute and it must be some reason why I'm important. The eyebrows, MTV awards was married that time. Come on, you can do it, but have you ever lesson they join it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:46       John Lennon talk about it. No, Lennon tastes like thousands of trips and say he's like eventually Lizard Cortana and talking about it. He says like he eventually just realizes he's dissolved his whole legal, he doesn't experience life as a can a narcissist anymore and he can't rate and some friend comes to visit him. I guess someone from England and say it's Luke. Remember that time that you wrote that song? You mean take then that was in like all the, all the different staff that is ego has helped him to do and Lennon of eventually arrives at the point before he has just come back of going do need some ego to get stuff done. You can just

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       well in Nail Bhagavad Gita, they're pretty clear about this is you are here, you are in the material world, but God's got nothing against material we did not denounce material with. They're not favor, absolute asceticism and totaled announcement of this accenture, you will experience it. I mean there's a for luck joyousness in Hinduism that I robbery enjoy. Yeah. Above the austerity or for some other faiths that I know equally lethal about and like sort of, um, what I like about that is the, the, the, the, the ego is an artifact that is not just this sort of product of commodification, commodification and capitalism by its, it can be this glorious expression in that Bill Hicks way of their consciousness experience, limitless consciousness. The experience in itself, excuse me, subjectively that it in a kind of like an an aesthetic idea, like a while to like, you know, owner, wearable work of art or be a work of art that we can become like, you know, the, it needn't be, excuse me, fuck it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       Now I think I'm going to actually vomit. It's like I'm drunk high west Scott. Cause somehow just by virtue of talking about it, but that we can become the realization of this beauty, this facet of the limitless that the whole can be experienced in the individual. That's the problem. I'm curious at this thing goes, the genie's out of the bottle on individual ism. You're not going to tell people you're part of the parish. Come on this, get together and be a collective. There's pot on a boiler suit. I said, that Shit's over. You know, people are gonna want to be individuals, but that's why I'm, I forever find myself banging on about the importance of religion because I think it's the only way to transcend the prohibitions and limitations of materialism that you've got to somehow engage the mythic imagination of people. But you're right that it is a sort of a form of propagandizing people and it does require that you yourself believe in the metaphor.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       And that's, I guess why I'm interested in hallucinogens and psychedelics because it's a way of make the dream real. I heard this thing frankie about like, um, like I think it's apocryphal, but it's a nice little thing like I was that when the settlers came, the settlers, they shamed the hunter gatherer societies and most notably the Shaman, the shaman, they said your rituals are bullshit and meaningless. Your dances, your spells and your silliness, Eh, out on the edge of the village and the Shaman became clown, lost the visa ability to be mythic and potent. The Shaman becomes the clown earth and profane nothing but each jokes to guard him against these new d as the settlers drag him down. You know, and this is what we've become now the shaman. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       I've often thought at the center of every joke scandal, you can see why shamans left on the edge of tone. You know, you've got to make a quick getaway sometimes

Speaker 3:          00:57:02       didn't like that one stick. Nailed mosques on that same thing. My backpack and off I go, Hello Wickham people, you know that got feelings. Yeah. So like what do you feel when you're in the midst of some Brouhaha? I wonder if the things I most enjoyed about you is watching on line, how you beautifully articulate it. The scandal around where the joke you made around about Harvey and Katie Price. I thought it was such a beautiful rendering cause I would obviously from a, a sort of a like a humanist, I suppose if you want to word perspective God k prize wouldn't class woman Harvey Meant Leo. But like, you know, like, but I obviously first and foremost it enjoy it, the joke, uh, and secondly, uh, your analysis of it, it was quite beautiful whenever I've been called upon to justify the, and my Andrew Sachs saying, ah, I've always got angry again. I've always got angry because I'm like, it's not even real. It's not even fucking real. They weren't even offended. It's not this just because of the collision of the BBC, this mainstream media because they saw, you know, like I've got an re engaged reenergized by it. How do you feel about sort of like justifying your own jokes, scandal stuff?

Speaker 4:          00:58:16       I don't believe it. I've never tried to really justify anything. Um, I think sometimes like that thing you're describing there, it's just that fact that you understand at the center of something that is much more complex than what has been boiled down to in a tabloid. You know, and you're like, well that routine starts a certain way and it goes a different place and when the night is different every night and blah, blah, blah. And why am I getting hoisted for this? So does that say to, but there's also the same, but it's like how many people have really got a sense of humor for this kind of thing. So like if you look at like what we would call a of comedy, we'd guess we'd see ourselves in that tradition, wouldn't we've, we watched probably all the same comics, like when we were kids. Um, the back was the biggest alternative comedy.

Speaker 4:          00:59:01       Sure. Like an hour over the period of our careers, maybe the office or something. So the office maybe got two and a half million or something. 3 million people and says maybe 60 million viewers in Britain. She charitably you're thinking like the biggest desk can go is about 5% of the population is going to be untethered to get more than that. You've much caught to be like, come on and a dress. I'll do it. So most people aren't into this. I know a lot of the problem is like you've been asked to justify jokes, which is okay, but not to people who don't particularly like or even understand like what you're doing. You know? So that's a huge part of it. Is there the papers in particular author by relocation, they're taking something that you said to one audience so that you said at nine o'clock on a Friday night in Newcastle and showing it to people over their breakfast and their home, county and Gomez, that's acceptable for them.

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       Yes. CSS. Yeah, that re contextualization is such a vital and neglected component and what I've always found it also annoying is the disingenuity of the papers when they do the repositioning of like that. I don't think that they are ever, he said what? Oh Man. Oh No. Come on. We can to have to

Speaker 4:          01:00:21       journalist of all people. Someone who let, Shirley goes through other people's fucking Ben. They sitting there like horrified that someone's dressed up as the twin towers at Halloween or something, you know? Oh my God, us to people who feel any shock. I had one that was like I did a joint is years ago. The guy who did the speaking clock died and I did something to call them or something that said hopefully died after, sees a small strokes and I got an email from the journalists or the Daily Telegraph who said, well actually miss through whatever his name is, dead die from a series of small strokes and I'm a bit to foreign his family. Oh if you can make him ask him if he'd find your joy commuters and is there anything you'd like times can just don't the money fucking joke. Then it's you joke, you telling them that joke they'd never have hair day. If someone projects upon movie on the side of a primary school that police don't erase Ron Jeremy for

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       the old throne children over there. Oh No, I'll get off on it. Yeah, you're quite right. Yes. You'll see that it's brilliant the way that they've extricated themselves, that people's sort of shock impulse is so readily available. The bypasses their bill, they go, oh hang on a minute, why am I being even told this now? It's like cause all of us on a personal level, no, that there's things that we would say to one another that now if I'm with my girlfriend's parents, I'm not going to go. I'll just reframe you boil. We had a real laugh about the med Taleah I recognize it and also doesn't it like it's a language that has a sort of a like exact got codes in it that I know that mine are, my actual attitude is to mental illness. I know my actual attitude is to death and sadness and grief. Didn't we not permit ourselves a bit of fucking latitude and a bit of relief?

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       Well, there's comedic license. I guess this is what we're seeing. Ultimately there's a comedic license in the same way that there's artistic license or poetic license. No, it's just a poet with the fucking sun coming up in the morning. Isn't it like a lion? We cannot put the fuck you talking about. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:16       Clinics lives. Waking Up Sifford I happen to just say, okay, could happen any time. It don't make a good point. The screwed up. It's rubbish. But you know we can, why don't we get this in license because I suppose it's, well let me look out like, cause I've often thought of that, that that that profanity being a sort of better nation of territory. Like I enjoy doing comedy that is like disgusting and rude and raw and raw curse I suppose get off in it and some very in various ways. But I think what it also does is it can sort of act as a kind of explosion that gives you access to different territories that people are a little bit shaken and then you can sort of say something beautiful or whatever. But I think that that people would like to keep the consciousness, the common consciousness, the public consciousness in existence on certain neurological pathways that exist on an individual level and on a collective and dialectic level also. And that if you can untrammeled those circuits, those grids with explosive behaviors that that's dangerous.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       Sure. I mean I think there's three things going on. One is you level late, what comedy can do, because if you're not allowed to shock and you're not allowed to do something at the start, because often those jokes they get most offended about or things you do to open up other subjects, right? Yes. Then that levels out what you can do. The other thing is they want to print the jock. You know, they want to put in the jaw, they're look of Victorian freak. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       I look at the depravity but they want to show it. But he does have perfectly formed to janitor tools from, I'll just give me a quick give a wag their cake and eat it.

Speaker 4:          01:03:37       Yeah. And I think the other thing is just a general thing they want to promote, which is the idea of Eh, public opinion as synonymous with press opinion. You know, so it ended up the public would rage but us, we looked on twitter and we find some people at Ridge, you can literally find anything if you want to prevent the in from either side of an argument, just the tape and to twitter. There's people who say, I hate yellow, yellow. Um, so what they want to do is make their opinions synonymous with public, the public domain, which is, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       yes, it's to, to validate and mandate there. I'm going to say it, Veltin showering I there, there I've said to allison showing it's been said now, hmm. Yeah, that's interesting. So then you think, ah, that bears sort of, that when we're talking about change, social change, there's kind of an, uh, an obligation to reimagine in ways that a role for bold and may initially seem sort of a bit mental in their boldness to, yeah. That's what I think as well. I don't know quite how to do x. The problem is, is because people have been so beautifully schooled in, I thought that, you know, it's in rejecting radicalism of associating it with the other nurse is the exotic, the feminine, the mysterious, the sort of, what do I want to say, the, um, orient or to reject it, to reject that. Now, whenever you say that, why don't we just sort of break down all superstructures and live in small, manageable communities. Like chimpanzees naturally works. We can't handle them on 75 relationships and just municipal infrastructure where required around transport and energy systems and not have power that exists for profit at all. And that we'll get our kicks and not from consumerism, but by interfacing with the limit. This beauty of the cosmos that we have access to for our consciousness.

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       Vote for me. I think you can like there's that thing isn't there? What your seven stages away from the public there or would you imagine the general public car, but then you try and do that like when you're rating. So I was trying to read a thing this week with the British empire and the idea of some people see the British empires, you know, it was okay. It was a mixed bag and it would just empirically untrue, you know, and, and, and for some reason it's not okay to be creationist, but it has all care to, of maybe then poems. It was massive excess deaths and it's all in paddock. Provable. And I brought some jargon with something along the lines of, um, there was a tray somewhere who said a stranger is a friend that you haven't met yet and I can't imagine who quite clear they died out and you know, so you, you sort of approach, you learn that, how do I gradually, it's through five stages may when I'm right and had a good actually bring people to the idea which is main, which is instinctively reject, you know, ideas of empire.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       Yes, that's right. Because it's difficult isn't it, to ravel and discard centuries if indoctrination like, uh, I mean I myself when abroad will sort of like, I remember the royal wedding was on when I was in la and I was like, oh, it's good. This, I don't remember. So I like got swept up in it. Know there were things where they sort of got it. This is sort of a broad desire and, and sort of possibly the wrong place to explore it, but they showed how many, like members of that congregation that day were dressed in literal Disney costumes if you ever seen that. But they kept going, look, here's this person that's a Disney costume. Like they found it, but loads of, I'm not that pepper middle turn. She's dressed like someone at butte in a piece. There is that one. Hang on a minute. This is bizarre. There's this sort of blending of the world of Disney and royal weddings, but regardless, my point was that that a little bit of pageantry and I was war, right, whooped up and you know, I love a World Cup. I love a bit of tribalism.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       Well, the electrically bro, all that end as if the lost power, the royals, so they didn't use to harm huge royal weddings. It's a fairly modern trend, but also they're going to need to like stopped shooting the cameras that can lead to stop turning the cameras, render in their audience eventually. So unrepresentative of brand and it's like [inaudible] Sanchez funeral. You know, you're just like, nobody needs to see those people. You're going to need to just focus on something else,

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       right? The revelation you can no longer, I suppose now with the ability to disseminate information is more and more difficult to control the truth. And while social media is still a corporate spear and controlled by those kind of, you know, interests, it's that just the information itself starts to have an impact. I said Ronins like I went two years ago, did a pace, were interviewed Keith. Richard took about 10 minutes. We've met to write 5,000 words like so for Rolling Stone Gig and like they, the stones themselves carefully manage the letting you see their audience because that's the elderly now altamont no more. And I suppose all empires, myths, emblems brands are held together by saying no, no, no, we are the populace. We found one person on twitter who said that that just funeral was a lovely event. Yeah. Laser flowers and consuming, I need a week so badly now I can sort of feel it sort of coming out amidst my organs.

Speaker 3:          01:08:51       So, so before I came reject more urine and some people would say that's all of the broadcast has ever been a hemorrhaging of micturation by a man floundering, looking for something to cling to. Thanks. No thanks for having me, man. It's really brilliant to talk to you. I really enjoyed it. It was a bit where it got really, really, uh, I zoned out, zoned out, glitched out. Like where I feel the flexing of the glass, of my understanding. I would quite like that. Sure man. Enjoy that. What would we do now? Well, that's the end of it and we go back to a normal life. So classes it isn't, it just have to accept this was a little paddock of time that existed. I can't live with you now. Is it? Oh, I've got children. You've got children. That's it. We just carry on with our lives.

Speaker 3:          01:09:29       We're all going to go have some ice cream. It's going to be okay, Frankie. Thank you. They go one shift. That was russell brands under the skin. The show is sponsored by my rebirth to go russell brand.com for information on tickets. But you may particularly want to go to Richmond on the 17th for July, Cambridge, aim of July. We're it on the 25th of July. It was brand.com if you'd like to show, subscribe on whichever meaty Aa or medium you receive these things on and give it five stars, please.
