Speaker 1:          00:00          Gary Young is a British journalist, author and broadcaster. He is editor at large for the Guardian and a monthly political columnist for the nation. He lived in the United States from 2003 to 2015 and his books include stranger in a strange land encounters in the DC, United States, no place like home, a black Britain's journey through the American south and his most recent another day in the death of America. A harrowing account of children's lives cut short by the ubiquity of gun violence in the u s Gary, thanks for coming. Thanks. You've been really keen to get you here for a long time. I particularly enjoy your journalism and your commentary on the subject of violence. What are you, I mean, we know that you're here to talk about another day in the death of America. Where did you, where the devices that just in one 24 hour period you, I suppose elevate the depths that take place on that day until their stories. Did you really just choose the day at random?

Speaker 2:          01:00          I did. It was the first day I could do, I've been in, uh, London promoting a previous book in October. And then I came back, I had a seven month old babies. How did a little bit of work to do to get in the good graces of my family then it was thanksgiving. Um, my family is American, my wife is American and this was the first Saturday after thanksgiving. So it was the, it was literally the first challenge. I mean, what's awful about, um, shapes his book is the reliability of the statistic. So every day in American seven kids on average a shot dad. And that statistic is sufficiently reliable that so long as you're choosing a weekend cause more do done at the weekend or in a, and what more do die the weekend even more dire in the summer when kids around and playing and all of that, um, that you could do any weekend. It would, it would work horrifically. So you could in the most brutal manifestation of it, you can sit down and wait for the kids to die. They will donate. It's reliable. It's a perfectly reliable statistics. I haven't seen the stance, but I can almost guarantee you that last weekend on average, seven kids would have at least seven kids would've died on Saturday and Sunday and next weekend will be the same.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Why is he in particular about these deaths that goals you? Why are you fascinated by this?

Speaker 2:          02:36          It's more that they all go me and that, um, if America pays attention when it's a mass shooting or some kind of spectacle, not every time, but most of the time, but on a daily basis, these deaths are just like the white noise around you that everybody gets on with. And you do almost in year two, it, you know, you're watching the TV and it's, um, after this, well before the sport, you know, and on 68th and Harrison, a 17 year old boy was shot dead last night when Blah, blah, blah. And then this is a show of his mum crying, saying [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          03:19          And um, after a while that just becomes the way things are. And um, I do think in this center helping British and thinking, well, it doesn't have to be like that actually. And so what I wanted to do with this random day was pick, let the day pick the kids. And then you know, there are, if you pick a different day, you get a different book. Um, there are, uh, every, twice a week a toddler either killed themselves or kill someone. Um, you know, there are, there would be other days it would be more compelling. Maybe the order would produce more compelling stories. But the point is this was like the day choose the kids and then I will follow them up and find out who they were because they just statistics methodology has the, because it is random, it gives you access to the horror of the randomness because it wasn't selected on the basis of it being, as you say, a compelling story.

Speaker 2:          04:31          It's just like you could spin a roulette wheel and that will land on a tie where there's devastation and unnecessary death. That's right. And, and many of them are compelling Ansley all of them are compelling in their own way. But what was important to me was not to kind of game it in order to try and draw out some, you know, to draw out a specific emotional response. So I was also very determined and went back with some foods with my editor about it. Um, um, that the, the order of the death should come in the order that they were shot. Not like Hilda Story. Yeah. Not the best one here. And so the first child to be shown, he's in in some ways the most terrific and there is a problem there for, for a book, which is that you pick up the stories about, you pick up this book.

Speaker 2:          05:27          The first child is the youngest child is nine years old. He answers the door and his mom's ex lover shoots him in the head and then runs off and he's, you know, ends up getting shot by the cops himself. And it's really the story of this kind of mums, unrelenting grief and her struggle to kind of get back to some kind of normal life. And ordinarily you wouldn't w you know, people of, you know, I read the first chapter and, and I had to put it down for a week, you know, um, but I thought it was important. Um, if, if that's the order in which they came, then that's the order in which, you know, they should be written if I was gaming it out or put something a bit easier first.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Hmm. Okay. So obviously what you're saying is true is important to you and a kind of practical truth as I posted the different kinds of truths that emerge in these times that are to do with, you know, deliberate construction of stories to engender a feeling that some people would argue even from an artistic perspective, you know, not necessarily a journalistic perspective. I'll know, but, uh, it will be more true, Gary, if the, if the, if it ends in this climactic moment, more people, you know, they've got the kind of way that we were asked as creative people to, uh, compromise is usually a or regional people. It'll be easier, isn't it? Ultimately you want more people that read the book. So why did you have a kind of a, an almost puritanical determination to commit to truth? And it is, there is something a bit Brechtian in about it in that sense of just kind of, you know, just here is I guess what I felt was how's that Brecht interests as well in terms of kind of, um, uh, not going to try and manipulate your own

Speaker 2:          07:14          motions here. Uh, although I mean the subject matter is emotional enough. I want to engage your critically and one way. I'm not saying that this is what I say. I have to do that I made a pitch for Brett in book about China. So I didn't build the way that you described it. I thought that sounded a bit like that I met kind of, um, uh, on the one hand the stories are so horrific and I feel compelling in their own rights that, um, um, that I'll need to be gamed. But that also there is some power in saying this was the day, this was how the day progressed. This is, this is what happened. And I mean, it's still my book. So there's still things I left out and things I put in. It's not like I didn't edit and it's also not like I didn't desire response from people, but that, um, to the extent that the premise starts with something random, I wanted to keep to keep honest to that as much as I, uh, as much as I possibly can.

Speaker 1:          08:35          I can see why you would, it's a very, very confronting idea just to say this day happened and this is how the day unfolded in the react. This is the reality of that day. So if you feel like that was a brew or an unbearable, well that's simply the consequences of looking at reality, not the artistry of a creative person with get you over interesting

Speaker 2:          08:56          position to analyze what's happening in America with violence more broadly. I read something that you wrote a couple of days ago about what trump means in terms of hatred. Um, man, submerged ideas becoming explicit. Do you, is there a relationship between the ideas you're exploring in this particular book? Are there, are we seeing something that's important and unique now? Eh, do you think in America? I think we are. I think that, um, it's important to recognize that trump didn't invent racism or bigotry, you know, he's button, there's never been someone at such a high level who's prepared to be so brazen about their bigotry. And that is new to have that lead from the front. You know, you can have George Wallace in Alabama, a segregationist running for president, but nobody thought he was going to whip me. It was a protest candidate. And instead you have trump going to Alabama, which only removed at state ban on mixed most managers in two thousand two thousand.

Speaker 2:          10:13          I mean, this is, you know, you're talking some serious kind of Taliban Nael, right? Yeah. You're doing them going all right. And um, s um, trashing these black athletes who, um, are making a protest about black lives matter now just they fill in the listeners. That's the, this is the protest were nfl players are kneeling during the national anthem because they're saying this, this anthem don't include me. Is that the idea that this anthem, until he's handsome, represents the ideals of the country, are not going to stand up for him. And, um, and I guess relating that to the themes in the book, I mean most interesting in the book is none of the kids, all of the shootings that we know of same race, which is usually in America, America is segregated to death. So white people kill white people. Black people kill black people.

Speaker 2:          11:12          That's why the, the, the term black on black violence doesn't mean anything cause it's just violence as how American violence works. And um, um, and none of them are killed by cops. But the date, the November the 23rd 2013 comes in between, uh, when George Zimmerman is acquitted for shooting Trayvon Martin Dead in Florida, which was when the black lives matter Hashtag was coined and Ferguson, which is when it really took off. When Michael Brown is showing back up in broad daylight and this and some Louis. So it comes in between those and it doesn't come. None of the death conform to that kind of, uh, that morality play of white cop, black kid. Um, but there are two ways in which it relates to the broader theme in the first is the way that the police treat these deaths for the most part, which is well, you know, that's the kind of thing that you know, happens down there.

Speaker 2:          12:19          So they don't, very few of the deaths are um, solved. You know, very few of the murders are solved and most of the parents think that becomes on even trying. And then the other thing is the way that they're treated by the press, which is, that's not news really. If a kid gets killed down there, that's where kids get killed. You know. So I didn't actually do this in the book, but develop this kind of notion subsequently that when I went to journalism school, there was, you know, there's this thing when, uh, when dope by some man. And that's not a story when a man bites dog, that's the story. But sometimes you have to ask yourself, why do these dogs keep buying people? And why the same people keep getting bitten and who controls these dogs. Sometimes the fact that someone keeps happening in a place is a reason to investigate it and no reason to ignore it.

Speaker 1:          13:13          That's very interesting isn't it? Because I suppose that the normalization is an important part of the intoxication. That this is normal. Do not question it. Leave it alone. Even that well known journalistic trope isn't it? I suppose a way of establishing what normal is. We surprised at what is acceptable. I learned because I, I'm a part of it is that these podcasts of cancer to university now and I wanted to learn more and uh, I learned this thing about net crow politics, like who it's okay to kill can and I suppose in the normalization of the deaths of these children in these particular regions, what you're saying is what the more that in the state in that it doesn't matter. You are indicating that this is, you're continually broadcasting. It doesn't matter that they're dying. It doesn't matter. They're dying. Exactly. The black lives

Speaker 2:          14:02          don't matter. And there are these assignments and these assumptions come, uh, come out. So one boy in Dallas, he's, um, um, he gets just 80 words in the Dallas Morning News, um, saying that he was shot dead while he was walking with his friend. And then the first comment after this 80 words is this a woman saying, well, I don't want to blame the victim. And then of course, that's what exactly what she'd done. Right. Um, but you know, where were the parents? You know, I wouldn't let my kid out at 1130 at night. This is, you know, um, uh, parents have taught us some sales, more questions and that the first thing that raises is what time should have kicked me out and not get shot. You know, when's curfew for kind of child, you know,

Speaker 1:          14:49          don't shoot after time. Children can be shot exactly. Side when they say he was a, he was an a student and it's like, well, what grade you have to get b plus, you know, fortunately that a child wasn't doing that well academically, you know? Yeah, yeah. If only you just pulled his, you know, just, just, just trying to bet barry Algebra, maybe he'd still be alone. It's a big, big rights. But then sneaking me, this woman knows nothing about his family,

Speaker 2:          15:20          this family, cause it's not like they were interviewed. You want to go 80 words and you find out that his mom knew exactly where he was. And that night it had been with his friend who was over because he was going with his grounding to church the next day. No word of a lie. And this is why it's useful to have these other things where you're saying, I'm not saying yeah, because it just sounds so idealic. They drank cocoa, they watched, we're the millers and they played two. Now, the worst thing that Samuel Brightman did, he's the kid who was shot that night was cheat at now. And he was a very, very persistent cheetah who know by all accounts. Then he decided to walk his friend, the six minutes bank to his granny's house. And during that six minutes he was shot dead. Nobody knows why Samuel that only moved that quite recently.

Speaker 2:          16:12          Some you didn't hurt anyone. He's quite a sweet, quite fragile kid actually. Uh, by every accountable, the people that knew him. And there's lots of kids in the book where nobody says that about them. Um, and um, uh, and then you got this woman saying, well, you know, I blame the parents and you went, well, no, you know, no, you don't know the parents. But there is an assumption if you're black and working costs and you live in some of these areas that it's not just like, well, we don't know anyone like that. It's that they're kind of almost a different species where the parents don't love their kids and the kids doesn't love life and the pennants and negligent and the kids are feral.

Speaker 1:          16:55          I understand. It's like it becomes permissible and inevitable. So I learned a few things they had like the black lives matters is a necessary response to the assumption black lives don't matter. The unstated blank lives don't ma'am. I see also that your commitment to truth is a requirement because what we're dealing with is the management of narrative in order to facilitate a particular response. That in a sense that the first comment after the iee word a eulogy was, uh, like that's almost like a reflex that that person had. Well, what do you say when a black person is killed in that era? Oh, right, well where were the parents and it's been late at night, you know, I mean, we couldn't have a result of conditioning. I was in America when a trayvon Martin was murdered and I like this. Even the sort of grammar of news is obvious gone an intensity to it. There's sort of, you see the police cars you've seen over at helicopter shot of a law and it also seems a bit like it's all merging into crime and gang. Even if those words aren't explicitly being said, because those tracks exist in my mind already. So all we need to do is far a few little triggers and I'll go, yeah, probably that kid was sort of a criminal or some value, you know, like it's, it takes effort to unpick my conditioning is a why English person in America having already been indoctrinated before my arrival.

Speaker 2:          18:18          Yeah, I mean it, it takes everybody method. Actually even the email, um, uh, I mean different efforts with different kinds of people, but the condition and the dominance, that kind of hedge many of that narrative is so strong that the parents of the kids who die will say to you, he hadn't been in trouble with the police. He didn't do drugs. And what they're doing is listing the reasons why he shouldn't have died. A high end listing. The reasons why they charge shouldn't have died every single, so there were 10 kids got shot dead that during that 24 hour period and they weren't all black, seven were black to Latino, one wine, every single blank parent. When you ask them, did you think this would happen? Did you had, you know, was this on your radar to a person? They all said, oh, oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:10          I mean, Samuel's mom and Samuel, you know, he didn't get in trouble in school or anything and his mom said, well, I didn't think it'd be a, my thought would be his brother. Yeah, the data new Eric just said, did not doing your job properly. If you don't think that your kid could be short in this city, just email you. So there is this kind of, what did you call it? Macro, macro politics. Politics is kind of, it's not just for the dominant forces in, in terms of who should be show a kind of encompasses all of us are thinking, well I have two American kids and we were living in America when I was writing his book. Um, that's when you realize, yeah, that's the, that's the fear I have for my child. I'm walking around with that too. Um, there was a weird thing in the reporting of it cause people went on about parenting.

Speaker 2:          20:09          So manage, so I saw it looking to see if there's any documentation about parenting and race. And I found out that, uh, this was a government study, that black dance, well, first of all, more likely to be single dads and any other race, but secondly, we're more likely to buy. They've read to help their children with homework, uh, uh, have breakfast with them. A whole range of things that black dads, while they were least happy to live with the mother, they were the most likely to do all these things with their kids. And I just thought, well, that can't be true you. So then I'm looking at a range of black that, well now this is when I'm looking through, you know, um, trying to find someone who's written something to amend. I think, well, what the hell are you doing your black that you do all those things and somehow you kind of, you know, the, the, the idea is so dominant that you just said, well, you know, obviously no, you know, but it was,

Speaker 1:          21:17          it's more powerful than our own mind. Like the Groucho Marx quote, who are you going to believe me or your own eyes? And that voice becomes so dominant in your consciousness, they use zips reality. Oh, that's what I say. Now I see the importance of the device, that truth, like if the commitment of the simple truth expose these narratives, uh, so a visceral Starlin, an erv ethic, it reawakens asked from the normalization of the death of children. So in your book, it's like older than a minute. Children die in isn't a thing that you just isn't, it's not an Aae word, a bitchery and then just roll your eyes and say, it must be parental responsibility. Now I can sort of see again, the idea of parental responsibility and incorporation of crime and stuff into those stories is a way of enhancing both the idea that these somehow culpability of the victim, your responsible and that has, that that plays a big role in American culture in that it's part of the general, this is an individualized culture.

Speaker 1:          22:17          If there's some terrible bad thing happening to you, it's not because you're this color or from this economic class in trial. Yeah. He should have tried to be artist to not get shot and like, you know, so like in this all to be it a different hue. So, um, it's based, that's an actually, that's a sort of a vital fred in perhaps it's the defining fred of, uh, the, uh, American ideology is individualism and personal culpability versus any kind of connected collective or national responsibility. That's something that's continually being eroded. How this gun culture participate in this? Why is it like, given that you're a person who tells stories in the way that you do what you like, it's not an like we saw other people just like guns. Why is this idea so a irresistible to American people? Why, why isn't it like that? You know, like you see sort of like a Bama speech after sandy hook or wherever and he's like, oh right, that's the day now where we don't have guns anymore. It's just like, no. Why, why is this fall so powerful? What does it mean to their unconscious?

Speaker 2:          23:14          Which is which? It's an excellent question. And, um, I guess one of the best ways to explain it would be, and you touched on it there in terms of tapping into some core things about how America feels about itself. They've got nothing to do with guns but work quite well with guns. So, um, when I used to go to the NRA, I went through a couple of NRA convention, the National Rifle Association, which is the gun lobby. Um, what's the vibe? Like? Weird, weird and kind of, um, it's a lot of white guys. That's the kind of 90% of the demographic, probably more, although they're trying to push gums in more in women's direction, said lots of now pink guns and Nice things that you can carry your gun in and kind of ways to look pretty with your gun and stuff like that. But, um, um, lots of white guys and I almost kind of almost sexual relationship to these, to these weapons.

Speaker 2:          24:18          You know, they kind of the stroking them and they kind of, you know, the, the, you know, that pouring them basically. And I would really play up my englishness in these things. I mean, first of all, cause it, you know, it helps and second because it mitigates the blackness, but we throw me now and I'm down to my becoming out of your mouth from Steven is really, and I've got puff Daddy, I'm looking at Puff Daddy, but I'm hearing them. If I could explain stevenage to then that would, so everything else, everybody, Steven, you can continue with your prejudices in Essex to Steven Itching. Um, and I signed that. Understand this, I don't understand this. Explain it to me. And to a person, they were off to the races. They'll say, are you married? Do you have children? Imagine someone broke into your house and they wanted to rape your wife and kill your children and take everything that you worked for what you're going to do.

Speaker 2:          25:32          Uh, you can, uh, wave a stick sticker them, you're going to call the cops and wait for the cops to come or you're going to defend your family and defend what you've learned. And so it speaks to kind of masculinity, homestead, um, a small government individualism, a notion of kind of my being right defend what's yours. Now the reality is, well, there are several kinds of facts that contradict that. Firstly, most people who are shot dead killed themselves. Secondly, you must often that you're much more likely to be sheltered by someone you know, did someone you'd done so well I should say is, are you married? Yes. Well, watch out for your wife. And so, um, they are, um, survey evoke these very primal yes, things in the culture and when confronted with that, if you start talking about background checks and um, you know, bamming semiautomatic weapons and stuff like that, he's not really a match for these basic ideas of American individualism, small government masculinity and so on. You're talking about tinkering. We think so they have a powerful narrative that they can tap into and the gun control people done.

Speaker 1:          26:58          It's brilliant isn't it? Because it doesn't seem like it should be important enough. A national rifle association and he's like, you imagined the English version and I have just been a bunch of cases in Berber jackets hanging around in the shyest that wouldn't be, you wouldn't think affecting policy of that. I'm sure we have our own sort of uniquely bizarre equivalent within some of our, more to temik issue in our own culture. But what I was struck by Gary there was like it shows you the limits of the rational mind, which is curious when we live in what is a pointedly a rationalistic of materialist culture that's based primarily it's least explicitly on economics that people's drives are not being sourced from rationale. Cause if you hit them with none, I know you're most likely first to kill yourself or be killed by someone that you know. So the best thing you can do if that is your fear, if fear is your motivator, he's do not have a gun. It doesn't just stay in. Yes they endorsed that go out. But that is the ultimate solution. Just atrophy in a cupboard had the brilliant the solution wasting away in a market space. So like it just shows you the truth again is irrelevant. It's irrelevant because they must know that they must know they must have been hit with those stats. Do you think? Well they have

Speaker 2:          28:13          and what what they do is they deflect them to other things. So you're talking about the hood, Adam [inaudible]. That's where these things happen, you know. So if you say to them, which is true, you're much more likely to be shot. People who have guns in the house, I'm much more, I used to be shot than they basically deflect that too. Now you're talking about black people really. So when I was promoting my book in America on the radio, uh, it was a Conan Chow and one guy said, um, if you just took out a few cities in America, then that whole average would be kind of way lower. And I'm saying, well yeah, but if you took half few seasoned in, wouldn't be America would do. I mean America is a hot wallet take out Chicago, New York, La, Detroit, where you can get cars from where you're going to get your blues from, where you know,

Speaker 1:          29:10          wait, he believes from, so that's again, it's in its coded like that this is a get even mentally, there is ghettoization happening. Why that statistics and nation is regarded incorporates a [inaudible] oh this is terrible statistic. But fortunately as white people that live in a suburban area, it's irrelevant. And that cause I, that's facilitated by an individualistic idea, isn't it? Or an individualistic perspective of, of, uh, of yourself and your country, I suppose, of their country. So like this, um, oh, your kids are American. So listen though, uh, the other thing you mentioned, this is like everything in that national rifle connect a convention seemed like it was primal, you know, their sexual connection, the idea of power, the idea of fear. So when we're talking about guns, we're not really talking about guns, we're talking about power and fear, sexual energies, Leighton impotence, sense of social breakdown, rampant individualism. Uh, so it's a very, very difficult thing to unravel because you, it's very hard for people to get, like I wonder what would literally app like why is it that it's no president can countenance or no government can count and it's, listen, we're just doing this thing cause it's playing with the right thing to do. Consequences. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          30:26          There's probably, there's a fatalism about it. So when I asked every family that I spoke to, so what do you think is going on here? When I ask them open ended question, none of them mentioned guns. Wow. Because I figure in the book it's like if your kid got run over, you wouldn't say, well traffic, we'd have to get rid of traffic cause you can't imagine a world without traffic. Um, so,

Speaker 3:          30:54          um, you know,

Speaker 2:          30:57          imagining the world without God thing I mentioned poverty that I mentioned racism because it's like, well that's everywhere. So kind of Ha you know, so I'm going to go with now parents or that Kid's dad or this is a rough neighborhood. But no, the kind of

Speaker 3:          31:14          uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          31:16          bigger thing. It's brilliant. I also think that kind of, um, uh, guns a big business and so there is, that's what

Speaker 1:          31:25          they have to be bigger than that wouldn't it? Cause like they're statistically give financially is not enough to have that kind of potency. It must be serving something very, very powerful. And I think that what you said there about the people can't imagine it, we just can't, that's been taken off the table. The idea that we could moderate Shafiq the idea that we could moderate guns, all of these ideas are excluded and we accept that this is a, this is reality. And I think probably all of us are on that scale somewhere with what we can conceive of and how radical a change we're willing to countenance how beautiful the world we're prepared to imagine. None of us are willing to start. Like so like what kind of conclusions does this lead you to in terms of power structures and the way that power operates, if you sort of, if it seems literally unimaginable to know Afghans?

Speaker 2:          32:18          Well, the, I miss as you suggest, this can work for almost anything in any country that if you are able to kind of swamp the field in a way, if you are able to kind of,

Speaker 3:          32:34          okay,

Speaker 2:          32:35          if you were able to remove something from public discussion and remove it from public countenance, then um, uh, then there's no reason why I shouldn't go on forever. So I kind of, different example would be nuclear weapons are used to be quite involved with cmd. I used to be on the National Council of CMV and I went away for kind of 12 years, 15 years to, uh, to the states. And when I came back and Coban and one of them he talked about getting rid of tried and I kind of thought have you still got tried and true domain is that people to stop talking about it? It stopped being, you can just tell him it stopped being a thing. And you know, I thought, God, how weird. I felt we were supposed to be afraid of the like young men from the North West with backpacks. That's right. And we've got this kind of lumbering kind of weird who's, who are we supposed to be firing that? Yeah. But kind of it had been removed from discuss. I'd just kind of stop thinking.

Speaker 1:          33:41          And you were a president was ncn be obviously a breast of these ideas. So that's very interesting. It's always a code to be, we you're talking to their mate was that we operate in, in a time where the powerful, now I have a master data and the historical knowledge of how public consciousness and the public sphere works. So they almost know you only got to manage this for a little bit of time and we're all going to be cool. And I think an obvious and pertinent recent example is grand felt and the management of the deaths around the toes just keep, just keep distracting, don't talk about, don't clarify any information. It will dissipate as surely we'll know like one of those totemic events that scars are national consciousness because it's almost too perfect. This sometimes happens. I notice in current affairs were symbolically many, many Fred's come together and there's an indelible connection to truth.

Speaker 1:          34:29          You can't, you go, oh no, this must be because we've long regarded poor people as dispensable and we've been making terrible financial decisions and we'd be ignoring it and all of our social infrastructures, a paper tigers and there's nothing set up to protect people and we actually don't care. So now we're going to have to stare it in the face. Even in that, when that kind of emblematic event occurs, there's a sort of sense that just ride this out, they'll stop caring. Other stuff will happen in a while. This will seem like an obsolete concern, like trident replaced with a newer, more novel kind of fear.

Speaker 2:          35:01          Yeah, I met, I mean your point about Grunfeld cause I, I do remember thinking at the time, um, cause it happened a week after the election and we count the election and that effectively what had happened June now election was that Labor had introduced a series of ideas that were once considered mainstream. And actually in most of Europe are considered mainstream, barely had been removed from the public square. We're going to tax rich people a bit more. Um, uh, we've done and not have tuition fees, which when I started at university didn't exist. Um, we are, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna move to a reality that we actually have within my, you know, living memory. I'm 48, so it's not like, you know, I'm loud. And they, um, I'm, I made called austerity, what it was. And so there was, when grenfell happened, I do think there was a price for people to put it, that we've just had this moment.

Speaker 2:          36:05          And then Graham felt happened and there was a kind of like, that's kind of something that we've been talking about. You don't have that. It was that it was part of the constellation that kind of brought those threads together. And I think, and um, uh, and I saw it in on social media where when things like this happen, there's always a group of people kind of who I'm sympathetic too who want to draw the border conclusions and say, you know, look, this is part of something bigger. You know, if it's nine 11 or whatever. And then there's always a group of people who seem to be more dominant and in any case have the power of the media behind them who say, you're exploring this tragedy for play command. Stop talking, stop talking about all the serious stuff and respect for the victims. And they tried that on social media and we've grandfathered, it didn't work.

Speaker 2:          36:58          People were like, no, this is exactly the time to talk about this. What else should we be talking about? And I do feel that, I'm not saying, you know, Jeremy Corbyn made that happen, but that um, coming out of this election there was a, there was a price to go, there was a language for it and people were kind of achieved to me. And um, and it's one of those examples where people, you know, people go, well, they'll neighbor didn't win, you know, and it's like, well actually they won quite a lot of arguments and they change the national conversation and yes, they are not the, you know, they have not formed a government, but let's not pretend they didn't win anything. It didn't change anything.

Speaker 1:          37:40          A slight, there's an identifiable disjunct because the sort of proceeding media noise was so much about condemnation and ridicule that the fact that in the face of that there was a positive reaction in a positive result, it starts to demonstrate this fissure that exists between this is the reality we are telling you and this is the reality you are experiencing now. The efficacy of media in dead Indian and a mosque in our own reality. Even as you said, like, yeah, I was thinking like that. Even me as a person that I like to think, oh, I'm really up for change and sort of radical ideas. Like I feel like a giddy school girls, they might get rid of this tuition fees go bloody hell. He's like, you're right. I mean like, but in my lifetime, that free education, he's already that the way that it is situated.

Speaker 1:          38:28          Now what this suggests to me, mate, and given that we sort of started off talking about the way we tell stories and you elected with your most book to make a commitment to truth, even if that costs you in a structural sense, like, oh no, the best terrible death occurs too early, or whatever it is. You know? So one thing I think that seems to be occurring is the outcome. Then what? What are we doing? If we've got true for on our side, broadly speaking, by which I mean, you know, collectivize breakdown. Powerwall stopped telling me stories of the individual stop ignoring how the influence of the powerful ways, having a devastating effect on ordinary people's lives. Stop separating from one another, finding reasons to hate each other. They are how, why are we not able to tell these stories in an effective way if we have true for now side. Why is this dominant story continuing

Speaker 2:          39:21          dominate? Um, I mean I think there are a few reasons. There's probably millions, but just, I mean, pardon me, I fear sometimes we don't quite even believe those stories are sales, right? That we want things to be true. But, um, we, we don't know where the album we quite atomized. So there are these moments when you realize, oh my God, everybody else has been seeing at the telly. [inaudible] tell me who else, six months as well. I didn't realize. So this is that moment jumie election where it was one of the questions times when a young woman says this discussion about nuclear weapons and disarmament and she says, I'm just wondering why so many people want to bomb everyone and there's a big cheer in the audience. Like, yeah, what, what, what are we, why are we having that conversation? Who Do you want to Boehm.

Speaker 2:          40:14          And so there are, we've, we all feel like, well, maybe it's just me. There's a lack of confidence. I guess Dennis is also true. I think that we are, um, uh, for the most part, not withstanding social media, we don't run stuff, you know, we don't own a large media corporations and things like that. We are still kind of quite marginal in terms of the means of distribution. And then certainly in a country like Britain or America, you have the kind of weight of this kind of awful history, which to some extent, um, could damn the people within it. So if you want to talk honestly, say about British racism or about Britain, then you'll have to talk about empire and slavery and murder and a range of things that kind of people feel implicated him. If you say, um, you know, people say, well, um, people will say we want a wall, or even though they didn't fight or we won the World Cup, even though they didn't play, but they'll never say we own slaves stole stuff that just not going to do that. They're not going to claim that. And so having kind of honest conversations about who we are and what we've done, um, people kind of shy away from that. So in more powerful countries, people kind of, um, the more honest conversation and the more truthful conversation is also kind of a more difficult conversation,

Speaker 1:          41:57          put too much into our shadows. We've allowed this to be a kind of a repository of truth where we don't look at, oh no, this is what Britain mean. So be careful when you talk about Britain, this is what freedom, this is what we have done, this is what we missed out. So true. Like we've become, and of course there are many, many troops, but there are so many unaddressed aspects of our reality that I suppose I'm a constructed reality is that we're invited to participate in seem more tactile, more attractive because we're a sort of an unwillingness for us to embrace our, the, the truth of who we are culturally own. I would have to argue who we are individually that there's been, there's a reluctance like I, so it was, I think Gary, like is it like, you know, like I hold these ideals, but if say like in a perhaps because I don't like it when people go me, well, why don't you give up all your money?

Speaker 1:          42:49          Then I always think that's like, oh fuck off and leave me alone. Stop cutting me out of the argument. Right. My Leica, I do some I think would it like, right, okay, what happens if I go, these people are going to cut. Anyone who needs a house is can come and live in my house. Now what's that gonna do to my consciousness? What is my resistance to that idea? Easier? A personal thing. Now I know I've got limited power as an individual, but is my unwillingness to commit. You say, man, willingness to look at what in my shadow, my own selfishness, my own capitalism, my own love of comfort, my own love of prejudge village, my own prejudice, my own ways of garnering what I am and who I feel about myself, the participant. Like, I am a participant in this system in these ways.

Speaker 2:          43:31          Yeah. I'm also kind of, that is a, um, in a way we kind of have to keep those two things in our head at the same time. Right? So we are, we are people, we are flawed individuals and we live in a capitalist society and we, you know, we want houses and we wants things that are going at my, my w, you know, we want things, we want comfort. And my personal feeling about all that stuff is do what you have to do so long as you don't screw anybody else over. Um, you know, if you can point to a time or a place where I've actually done something, you know, actually made somebody else poorer or worse off than that's one thing. But that, um, you giving away your money doesn't change capitalism. It just makes you poorer. And, um, uh, I'm interested in changing the system, not in, you know, seeing you in, um, uh, seeing you in, in poverty, but also just kind of linking where we are as individuals to kind of more collective things.

Speaker 2:          44:39          And this comes back to the gun thing actually and and children in particular that we talk about personal responsibility a lot with guns, but there is also with children, particularly a collective responsibility. That's why we have sexual services, child protection services, child courts, all that kind of thing. There was an awareness that they're not fully responsible and so there is this general way of understanding things. I think that like I am not a state, I am not a society. I'm an individual. So when people say, well say someone did that to your kid, wouldn't you want to just go out and murder them? So yeah, I would. That's why I'm glad there's a code because I know want to be responsible for kind of, you know, how we respond to these things personally that I would, I would rather, there was some independent reasons why of doing these things and I guess, yeah, we all have certain privileges.

Speaker 2:          45:42          We live in the west, we all have certain privileges, so we have to be aware of them, but we can't let us have them disable us. What can we learn from the particular distinctions between these two, the studies of violence that you've undertaken in the United States and England? What are the differences say about those countries do you think? Well, um, so I've been doing a series this year on knife crime in Britain, could be on the blind, um, looking at tracking over deaths of kids 19 and under, um, from um, um, from stabbings and um, which kind of mirrors in a way what, what was happening in the states. Uh, I think the broad, the broad lesson that you, one can learn from path of those things is that, is that there are reasons why this happens that are not, people kind of feel like this falls out of the blue sky or dark sky, that kind of, it's evil.

Speaker 2:          46:47          It's, you know, bad people is, and it's really, you know, in America if you take segregation, poverty, racism, kind of underinvestment in, in communities, and then you put on the top of that big pile of tinder I violent weapon that can kill people really easily. What do you think's going to happen in Britain? Um, if you cut child and adolescent mental health services, youth services, um, slash c, um, you know, social services through kind of a local councils, um, then what do you think is going to happen? Something's going to give, but of course it's going to be the poorest people. It we're to suffer. So there are a nobody, I I s the last piece I did for the, um, beyond the blight series was an interview with the mother of a child who had killed someone who'd been sentenced and she had written to her mp saying, please save my child.

Speaker 2:          47:55          She had taken parenting courses. She had told a local social services, either my child's going to be killed, all this going to be a body bag. She had asked them to move her because their child was struggling. She had tried all of this stuff and what she said was, did my child did the local authority, a knife in my child's hand. Now he's responsible for what he did. They don't try everything I could. Yes. And where we found yes. And it's possible to keep all of those things in your head at one time that everybody has to take responsibility for what they do. And that includes us collectively as a society.

Speaker 1:          48:38          I understand we've been overly biasing towards narratives that are about individualism. And the reason I think we're so susceptible to that idea is because we live in our own heads, we are individuals. So that seems where people go, you know, oh well he did each and at that made you think, Oh yeah, oh I'm me and I didn't do it. There's immediately a sort of a fertile ground for that to flourish in and they're almost, it requires of us a little more work to see us, the invisible Fred's between us, the collective connections that our culture is made up of. And if that story is not articulated and beautifully told, we forget it. Cause it's almost like I feel like I've return like [inaudible] to the my self as an individually driven on my own. Those kinds of psychological memes, like they're, they're effective in my own Ed.

Speaker 1:          49:29          So it, it takes an effort to feel like I'm connected, I'm part of this and we are all one. It's a difficult story. So it's in a way we live in a culture that tells us the stories about ourselves that are the worst stories and neglects to tell us the positive stories. And it seems like, I mean, Gosh, economics is one level of it, but I, you know, sometimes I wonder if there is more than just entropy or uh, you know, like inertia at work behind it because it seems like such malice. It seems like it can this be as simple as the attainment of profit behind all of this suffering behind all of this pain is just people going, no, no, no. It's better off to sell stuff if people think they're individuals and that they've got buy things to feel better and if their lives about it's their fault that go after we will use.

Speaker 2:          50:12          It's, um, it's, it's more about neglect. It's more about these going back to the black marks mammoth thing, these people don't matter what happens to these people, it doesn't matter. Um, uh, and if we can convince ourselves that these people don't matter and what Hamson doesn't matter, then all sorts of things come into play. And so what this, what we've been trying to do beyond the blade and why I was so keen to interview them, the mother of the boy who killed was to make the point that in order to solve these things, we have to humanize everybody. We actually, we have to, it's not a killer. It's a child who killed, is a child who did something monstrous. He's not a monster. That people are more than their crimes. That in a world where some of these people, anybody in ms story isn't human.

Speaker 2:          51:08          All sorts of things are possible to neglect, to forget to dismiss. And so we have to start off from the basis that even the people who are doing things that we hate Nancy's, we're humans. And that actually is the problem. What are they not human? We could plug that somewhere else that, that period and all of the other periods, it was similar. It was Armenian genocide. It doesn't matter. They were committed by human beings. That's what scary about it. Once we start pretending that they're not human beings, then we found a way to kind of um, uh, park this stuff somewhere else. So people do, people can do very bad things. They can also do brilliant, wonderful, beautiful things. And um, um, either way and, and, and then comes the problem of saying, well, Nelson Mandela, he was a saint or saying that people are doing wonderful things and sanely now the still they're people, they're people. And that is a very inspiring notion because it means it could be you, it could be you doing that.

Speaker 1:          52:15          Yes, yes. I see the necessity of it. And I see now I understand your commitment to truth because you're within truth. There is complexity. And in the complexity though, there is a revelation if you sort of finish off, uh, if you allow the threat to finish where the conventional narrative ends, then you are didn't your denying yourself truth. Just beyond that is where the explanation is. If you allow the story of it was this time of night in this community with this, within this demographic, then you are not participate in, in real truth there. I understood, I understand the importance and significance of that. I also recognize how important it is too broad to firstly, I dunno, identify different stories. Uh, I think, uh, another relatively recent, an interesting example where that was it, when was that? There was sort of the riots around that police custody, murder sort of around north London. Oh yeah. That old though. The peculiar way they sort of bloomed like some sort of continuum of consciousness was of regionally awakening what they do. What did you think about that, those disturbances?

Speaker 2:          53:20          Well then no, far from, uh, where I live and um, you know, I s I thought, well, yes, you know, a young person has been killed and uh, what kind of world would it be where people were angry about that? And you can try and manage the anger, but the real way to kind of, I mean, there are two things that you have to do to actually confronted. The first is tell the truth about how that happened to make sure somebody is accountable. And then the second is make sure it never happens again. And anything short of that, well one dissipate their anger, but people have a right to be angry. Not least when people, you know, there is this sense whether it's [inaudible] or or something like this, it's like, well that's not a way to kind of, you know, saw that out, you know, writes a letter to your mp or what, when people feel that system has failed them and that it didn't just fail them like our now you know, it's going to be another week before you know, my, my toilet's fixed.

Speaker 2:          54:28          If found them in a way that meant somebody died, that it was existential, somebody died or in case of grant from loss of people dying, then anger is a very least you can expense. And um, um, there is some sense for those people who could never imagine that this could be them, that there is some sense of decorum missing some sense of propriety. And you know, I'm always struck by remembering Michael Heseltine's pamphlet. I know you didn't see that coming. Did Michael Heseltine's report after the IC one riots were, which was entitled? It took her a riot and he's making the point. Yeah, I know. Weird that like what else would you have listened to? These people have been saying all sorts of things for all this amount of time and nothing's happened. So what if not days, I don't think this was entirely his argument, but it took this for you to pay attention and um, um, as society as to ask yourself when these things blow up.

Speaker 2:          55:47          And I said, well you know, we have to kind of get back to normal. We have to get beano Cole Cole's for calm cause it was cold for calm and it's like how come can you be when people are being shot dead in the street? How come can you be when people are being made about the state? What kind of piece existed before these rise? I'm sure you've felt very peaceful, but I don't feel peaceful if I think that my child to be one of those. And there is coming back to the book. There is this sense from that, that letter, the woman who kind of wrote, you know, to send me Brian died. This could not be my child. This could not be me. I cannot imagine I single way in a world in which this could be me. So this is happening to a different species.

Speaker 1:          56:33          This is like in James Baldwins phrase about or at least analysis of the creation of taxonomies, the necessary other that if you can have a demonstrable you different and uh, hopefully visually different other then there's a sense that, oh, I'm not culpable, but like it doesn't require such vivid demonstration. Like I know the way that I think of people that are a rough sleepers as, oh, that's not me. And I was like, that couldn't be me. Oh. Like I said, once you recognize that these distinctions are merely superficial stories, veneers over the truth, suddenly we are all vulnerable. Suddenly it's all of our children. Suddenly we're all at risk. Suddenly change becomes an absolute necessity within which we must all participate. And I really appreciate the way that you tell stories. And the way that you communicate for aluminate in through truth ideas that may otherwise not have been revealed. So I'm very grateful. Thank you for coming on under the skin mate. Well for having me. It's good. Good show. Wasn't it splintered? Nice one. We are, you've got mark [inaudible] before we go, as well as your own book. What other books would you recommend or sometimes we ask people to recommend a few books that we should read. Um, uh, I've

Speaker 2:          57:43          just been reading no is not enough by Naomi Klein, which I think she's been on the show. She's good. No is not enough. Um, um, copy of that book from the ground around roads, um, by Colson Whitehead, which is a brilliant book about, um, a abolitionist. It's a, it's a novel, uh, which is, um, which is, which is really good if you've got kids under the age of about four, so much. I really like. It's just a story about this little kid and everybody's coming around because they're having a surprise party for his dad and it's kind of every kind of slice of kind of Caribbean life, I think in amount of salaries. Uncle dd looks like a baby player and his Auntie, whatever, who looks like she probably works in local government and he's got two hours and one's really fat and one's really skimming and then his mom.

Speaker 2:          58:39          Anyway, let me start, comes home from the office and they will have a big pies. It's good. I mean, I did not ruin the plot there, Gary. Yeah, it was quite a lot about Simon. Yeah, well the kids ended up going to bed. They go, I'm going to be analyzing the next week, so I'm pretty sure this is subtext to that. Thanks. Thanks very much, Gary here another day in the death of America. That's out now here I've read it. I like the, you've got these air, 1950s white people in the cafe got coke or shout because as I said, very clear semiotic indicator there. Call it. Cheers, mate. Thank you.
