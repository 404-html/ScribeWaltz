Speaker 1:          00:03          Kenny is a psychological therapist, counselor and broadcasts though who's training and experience in areas including eating disorders, ptsd, trauma, surviving abuse and relationships, has seen her become a familiar face on British television. She spent 17 years working with people in crisis in some of the toughest, the states, and runs her own therapy clinic as well as a free healthy social network that aims to help people find balance in their lives. She has two children and lives in Manchester. Emma can eat welcomed onto the skin. Thanks for coming on. Thank you for having me. Oh, well, that's. I suppose to understand your background a little bit, so could you tell us a little bit about the therapeutic work you do? I guess that my background begins when as an adolescent I was sent to the psychological system, so I was a regular truant. They have problems at school and when I kind of went and saw a psychologist, what I found was I just couldn't engage.

Speaker 1:          01:09          I didn't feel like they listened in a way that progressed me and I kind of remember thinking at the time, why can't adults speak to young people? In a way that respects the fact that they are intelligent and know who they are to some degree, so I kind of thought and ruminated on it and even though I had problems at school, I decided that was the direction I wanted to go in to actually be able to transmit my own experiences into some way of understanding of the young people. So that's what got me into therapy. I did a psychology degree initially and then moved into therapeutic context, so studying more client centered didn't necessarily fit me because I'm quite a challenging person. I like to use challenge in therapy what it means and so your a therapist, but it sort of conventionally inferior p, the therapist is what managers listen and you stick your in there and go, yeah, I mean that's the type.

Speaker 1:          02:02          One of the things that I've tended to do is to feel that even though there are therapists that are challenging, but certainly client centered isn't so egan and Roger's aren't necessarily egan and Rogers or just to have the kind of God so client centered therapy. But I think purism is an interesting area. Full stop because I kind of really struggled with it and I was training and I was really lucky at Manchester University that they kind of allowed me a bit of a freedom to express my own beliefs in what I thought I wanted therapy to be and I kind of argued that I couldn't ever be either of those types because I'm not that person. And even when you watch therapists and action who claimed to be pure, often you'll see they're not. They're doing something kind of different. So I learned in the long run the best thing I could be in therapy with me, just me, so that I felt that my presence and conversation and experience with the client's journey that really authentic and that's what's effectively worked for me.

Speaker 1:          02:58          You think that part of the role of therapy is to discover a kind of truth, a truth of the client's experience. Is that so do you think it's necessary for you to be authentic in that? Absolutely believe that authenticity is key. Full Stop. I think that we talk about authenticity as if it's quite easy to achieve. Just be yourself is a classic example of things that people say to you when you're growing, go up and when you're an adult, just be yourself, but actually being yourself takes a huge amount of courage, a huge amount of self discovery, a willingness to be wrong, a willingness to learn all the time and it's quite scary. So I would say that I try to be as authentic as I can be all the time. I'm sure at times I get scared and that makes me wear a mask or I'm convinced that somebody needs me to be or authority, so I'll put one of those and I have to work against it, but I think that's human nature to some degree.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Went at Stanford, that was in there a couple of weeks ago. He's like an explorer survivor. Yeah, I know. He's like a bit like bear grylls. I think he's the grunge bear grylls. That's how I see him. It's like a shelf stripped back bear grylls who said that when he spends prolonged periods of time on his own, the uh, what do you know that that is the aloneness itself is more challenging than the survival aspects of what he's doing because he said that when you're in relationship with another person, you're constantly refining yourself and adjusting. And he very interesting. They used these guys like even now as I'm looking at you and I'm seeing if you approve of one sign and was really sort of quite fascinating. So when you're talking about when it's talking about like having an experience of an authentic self, it must be a difficult thing for anybody to achieve because we responding to such a lot of stimulation.

Speaker 1:          04:54          So sort of stimuli. Absolutely. I mean everybody seeks approval. Everybody to some degree wishes to be liked. But at the same time I think my journey began when I started to feel like it was actually me wanting to police the world and get liked by everybody that was possibly making me exhausted. And I wasn't really reflecting on what I needed. And there was almost like a desire to just accept that it isn't selfish to concentrate on the self, it's self full, and to actually strip back what I thought people wanted to know about me and wanted me to be like, and to just be myself and to some degree in my therapy, I think that's what works. That I don't feel that firstly I need to be judged by my clients. And conversely I don't judge my clients either. The, when we experienced that thick conversation that kind of occurs as a thickness in therapy, I know that people.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Who Do you mean by that thickness? I think practitioners who may be listening to this or get it and probably people the falling in love or having really, really intense relationships. It's almost like there's a northern context to the relationship and other feeling in the room like this. Something bigger, wider, more cerebral, but almost touchable. Even though it's not that. It's like a sense of knowing that this is where we're meant to be in that moment and just feeling completely connected and almost like within a bubble of something good. I'm not saying it isn't with pain or that there isn't challenged, just that it's good.

Speaker 2:          06:30          You can use the role of the therapist then to somehow recreate what sounds to me like you're describing there may say is a kind of spiritual experience that people perhaps to do. You know, the example you used is like when you're in love with somebody. I like that like in a non romantic context that it that would pop pop possibly a person with a mom or a rabbi or a priest or a shaman where you feel like I am being myself. Here I am present kind of dangerous place to go with people, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          07:01          I think that throughout history, wherever you are and whatever culture and society, they'll always be people who, as you talked about then have different definitions but essentially help to navigate. I think that my job in my therapy is navigation. I'm not saying I absolutely direct the journey, but if the truest waters ahead or if people keep making the same errors, it's my job. I feel to help them engage with that process, learn, move forward and not end up in the same position so to speak, so I don't think it's my job to tell people what to do, but I certainly think it would be without courage to listen to people constantly making the same mistakes and not encourage them to explore different avenues and to see different vantage points and that's something that I stay true to within my therapy and it's something that I think my own therapy when I was training was always the frustration.

Speaker 1:          07:52          I always felt like I wanted this person who was sharing the space with me to kind of fundamentally feel like they were with me. I know that if you've not had therapy, you might have experienced that with your parents or your friends. That might be moments in your life where you just feel that that person is with you. You don't even need to have words. There's just a sense of being. And I used to feel a frustration that I never felt that. So potentially if I'm looking at it on a psychological level, you know, there is a level of me wanting to create that experience for my client because I think that everybody in life needs to be able to replicate that. I think true happiness comes from feeling that you find are those that share that space in that way and then if you have had that in therapy, you can go out and when you feel it elsewhere, you know it's good and you want to stick with it. And that's something I think it's really important to almost transplant that experience into reality for the client.

Speaker 2:          08:45          I'm going to say some bold things now. He'd come those bold things. I think it's difficult for me to make grand statements because I only know what it's like to be America like in America or in or broadly speaking, so privileged western democracy type places, but it seems like there's some sort of mental health crisis going on. Addiction epidemics, self harming, a in disorders. It seems to me like sort of a. and you know, I know there's more information available. I'm sure there's all sorts of social factors and various contributors leading to this statement. It seems like people are crying out for some sort of connection to nature. One of the people are very much respect to early guests on the show. Adam Curtis says that politics is as lost its ability to talk about feeling the way that people feel that politics has become sort of managerial.

Speaker 2:          09:30          That people say, well, we'll manage this for you. There's no real vision of where we're going and what sort of the great sort of like in the last century, sort of the, the great religious institutions have been challenged politic, the great sort of experiments of fascism and communism broadly. We know once again we can say kind of failed or certainly fascism revver level look at that and so like, you know, like mental, like psychiatry therapy, sort of like in a way a relatively new science and its relationship with neurology was an anatomy. It's going to be ongoing as these connections and observations and new maps and merge. But excuse me, I feel that the, the work that's being done in understanding how individuals feel in how groups feel it's going to be vital in reforming the way that we see ourselves, the way that we participate in, in society. Um, so emmy, Emma, as you have indicated, a lot of people don't have the privilege of engaging in therapy. So how do people employ these principles? What should we be looking for?

Speaker 1:          10:38          I mean, I think that therapy is the ideal where you don't need it not wanting to get rid of my job, but ideally communities, societies and neighbors, friends, people who are around you, they can be the thing that you actually need. And it would be my ideal, you know, the Nirvana would be that we support people without the need for any of that. I think the medical model in the UK and in Western world is something that obviously has benefits to some degree, but I think we're missing this vital link. My feeling is that when I'm working with so many people who are maybe suffering from really, really severe depression and anxiety and people who have manifestations with eating disorders, for example, when I'm hearing their stories, I feel that compassion and empathy and time, a nurture and a real engagement with getting to know the dysfunction and then recognizing the function from within that dysfunction is what's required, but that takes a huge amount of time when we're looking at it in the therapeutic context.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Money as you noted, because the NHS is really burdened. You know anybody out there who thinks that practitioners aren't trying to do a good job. It isn't that it's just the amount of people who genuinely need that care aren't receive and get and when you get that practitioner they're working with high level crisis, do you not kind of doing the early intervention. So for me the bigger question is how can we as a society start to be more compassionate to people around us? That's the big thing for me. I always make an effort to get my note to know my neighbors. It's a northern thing. It's a working class thing,

Speaker 2:          12:26          right? I'm going to be living in now. Let me interfere in your business. I'm also a trained therapist. Now, notice you're not communicating very well when you live on. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Obviously that would be one way of doing it, but you know that kind of thing that I think we have. These are measurable opportunity in society to make ourselves more healthy. You said things like going outside and even when you're working with people in despair, one of the big things that you want to do is look at their diet, looking at their exercise regime, look at how often they get outside, look at who they socialize with because human beings are human and they're social animals, and if they haven't got access to any of those things are they're not eating efficiently and they're not exercising at all, that's manifesting more problems. So helping people to deconstruct is one of the things I would say. You don't need a therapist to explore how to impact on your life more positively through food or through the amount of exercise you give yourself or the white light that you get on your skin or the Times that you knock on your neighbor's door and ask for a cup of tea. There are things that are within reach to everybody. Even people who have low socioeconomic standards can still afford to eat better, if that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          13:33          What interests me about the work that you do is you see that on this podcast a lot. It's very cerebral now know your sort of a qualified clinicians, so like you know, like not like I recognize that you can also communicate on that level, but say you know, when we're talking to people that are, as it were, conventional academics, it's likely you feel the weight and freight of their experience and study. But when I'm like for, it's like one of the reason I'm doing this podcast because I do a degree religion in, in global politics. So as university, when I'm sitting in someone's unpacking the upanishads for me or vedic literature, what I'm always thinking and probably is affecting my ability to learn is how does this relate to me now? Like you know me now out, do I apply that if this doesn't apply to my experience of being human than a, I don't care.

Speaker 2:          14:27          You know. And you know, like I know a lot of people will listen to this podcast where mental health is probably the thing that's uppermost. I know there's a lot of people listen to these things for self betterment. They want to learn, they want to know more stuff. But I think a lot of people that are like, right, yeah, I'm not happy and like sort of self harm, eating disorders, drink too much. Thanks so much. Drugs, feeling alienated, feeling lost and like something like in a guy in her next door neighbor and ask for a cup of tea says something about the kind of society we're living in that that's bloody sounds like quite radical thing to do.

Speaker 1:          14:57          It does feel like that for lots of people because we've kind of become so disassociated from to some degree what makes us happy. I also think we spend a lot of time trying to avoid difficult feelings because we've been told that difficult feelings or something we should run from or feel ashamed of or challenge in a way by using alcohol or drugs or sex or anything that helps us escape those feelings. For me, I did that the years, you know, I run away from all of the feelings that essentially I needed to confront so that I could work through them and find why feel is a piece with the part of me that I think I felt was dark and it's not dark. It's just human. But before I can reach others, I have to reach into myself. I have to feel that connection with myself.

Speaker 1:          15:45          So the reason I can ask now and I asked people for what I need if. Because I know that I have enough resources within myself to manage whether they reject me or otherwise, and that's something that's given me a real freedom average to get there through accepting that I was never ever going to find what I wanted through the avenues that I was seeking in the man you know, had an aneurysm and having all of those areas of my world that I thought were bringing me happiness, but that was so temporary and moment or a that they really gave me, I suppose what you were saying earlier on like that spiritual connection, that sense of. I like the fact that I think I'm really this tiny little.in infinity, but that that's amazingly miraculous and the this moment is blink of an eye of my consciousness is mindblowing and taking it and reframing it from that perspective has been incredibly helpful. Firstly, because it gives me a humility where I know that as long as I do as little harm, I hope I've done

Speaker 2:          16:48          a decent job and go on, go on, go into a therapy session with as little damage as possible with fuck every one smack in the mouth. How does. See. I understand what you're saying about sort of like a, you know, the sort of miracle being and acceptance that is difficult to resolve yourself outside of yourself. How did you get there though? How did you get from being an adolescent who was a truman and inferred that heaven is him played its part of your journey. How did you become disillusioned? We've had aneurysm and is it that reached you because you said you were initially, you were not a lot. You didn't feel satisfied with the therapeutic experiences you had as a teenager. What you must, I'm guessing, have had some kind of satisfying experience with therapy at some point.

Speaker 1:          17:38          A lot of it was to do with the self work that I did so many years ago. Not that I do this now. I kind of became quite intrigued with things like the runic alphabet and using things like an overview of a runic. Every day I started writing to myself, journaling myself, learning that actually it was okay to make mistakes. One of the big things that I used to do is go to bed and over analyze every single conversation that I'd had for fear that I would have offended somebody and then everything. Honestly, every day it was exhausting and then I learnt that actually, you know what? It really, it doesn't matter unless there was intent there late. I might offend people. I might upset people. I might at times hurt people, but my intention is not to accepting that I can't always be responsible for another human being's pain or resolve or journey and instead the all I can do is be with them on it.

Speaker 1:          18:32          Even if they reject me or if they accept me. That's the journey of life. That's it. That's what I'm here for. I think having children was a big awakening. When you say, what was it? No, 15 years ago I had a baby and everything I thought had meaning just totally transformed like all I believed. Until then was that though as this book search in life that there was this huge search for something, if anything, this thing that filled this gap, I'm not suggesting that everyone runs off and acid. Yep. But the minute I held him like I'd had no maternal experience or feelings, I got pregnant because I was told I couldn't have children, so one I'd always lived a life where if you told me I couldn't do something, I would find a way to do it. That's still a philosophy I kind of live my life by, but I had fertility treatment.

Speaker 1:          19:21          I had a baby. I held him and I was blown away because there was this magnificence of being an ordinary, ordinary miracle. Just an everyday thing that people do all the time, but he changed everything. Like he made me the best version version of myself. He made me realize I was far more compassionate and patient that I even knew I cut those resources to be. Both of my children have consistently reminded me that I have an abundance of love that I never even knew I could tap into and everybody finds something. Eventually. Some people find exercise, some people find nature, some people find friendship for me. Motherhood. Motherhood was it.

Speaker 2:          20:03          You did thank you that you have. Oh well you, you said some things that are about in a way embracing convention and identity because I've had a similar experience or I'm having quite new for me, still a similar experience as a parent. This like certainly disrupting myself. Centerdness trying to stick to the self centered but as someone. Several people in the house. But you also earlier in it you talked about sort of like. You know what again, as I say like often when I'm talking to like academics and stuff in here, if like runic letters or the itching come up, right? People would like you clear off because this is like, like you know, we live in a that don't really like to recognize sort of folk. I guess. I don't know. Folk history and something I'm becoming more and more interested in and I know that sort of, again, given that you are a psychotherapist, like that is interesting, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          21:04          That I'm fascinated by Carl young. I'm fascinated with. He's intrigued with like Kundalini Yoga and the itching and ways of dealing with the mystery because let's face it, the unknown is where we all get to. I was listening to, um, sort of a debate or a conversation I suppose between Sam Harris, the atheist, that neurologist and sort of pundit and, and Richard Dawkins and they were talking about how, you know, it's like the sort of the beauty of the theory of evolution and it's certainly sort of his magnificent. The way I'm packed. Our understanding of sort of material evolution of, you know, it's a great masterpiece in determining ideas of like, of all time. But like of course it says that, you know, we, we can, we don't know how it begins or how it can begin this moment of inception. So at some point, you know, like we all have to interface with the unknown and, and I, I suspect, and I sort of feel like I know that there are limitations for our capacities as human beings to hold knowledge, but knowledge is potential for knowledge, is infinite capacity for understanding is fine, that there's going to be faith is going to be required, a way of dealing with the unknowable is going to be a requirement now like when, if we have a type of culture that prohibits that because it's seen as woo woo or sort of like.

Speaker 2:          22:32          I think actually one of the things that I'm sensing is it sort of a part of this is to do with Patriarchy and misogyny. The oppression of the female principal of the flow of things in a male nurse is a kind of a self contained idea in a way. The female femininity as it relates to creativity, both biologically and socially is a sort of a. It I sent down, I'm being very basic here, but this is kind of a flow to the idea of femininity. I wonder, uh, how this printer, how men can embrace their own femininity and how, uh, the feminine principle being bought into life and it like as sort of these, these ideas of connectedness that you talk about, uh, how, what do you think is the significance and how can we learn more and how can we enact them? I think that the men this modern age is a confusing one. I think there have been so many changes. There's so much more androgyny. Women obviously, and rightfully so, at least getting to a point where there is more equality, certainly not equality, but in the western world there is more equality. I think that the thing that men need to acknowledge is that firstly, the human

Speaker 1:          23:46          animals and the need for connection is absolutely instinctual. It's not about them being weak because they need somebody to support them. When they vocalize their pain and men just don't vocalize their pain as often as they should. That's why it kills them. That's why suicide is such a high rate in men under 40 for example, we know this, but actually taking that step, that brave step to say, I'm in pain to say I don't know what to do, to say I'm confused with all these stereotypes and schemers about what a man should be. To me. When you become at one with yourself, male or female, you recognize the very thing that you need as a human is to just say, I'm a mess. I'm a mess sometimes, and within that mess is something incredibly beautiful masterpiece based. I tell all my clients and particularly in the man who struggled with the authenticity and the ability to just say I'm in pain and to not know what to do is to acknowledge that that's a completely generic feeling.

Speaker 1:          24:53          That's the human condition. If anybody tells me they know exactly why they're here and they know exactly what they're doing, then I think that they're not being honest with themselves. I think, in fact, it's the wonder of not knowing that makes life the journey that becomes the potential to make everything that you experience in this world feel that it has something more guttural, more cerebral, as you said, like there's something more, I don't know what that is, and it's okay. It's the not knowing of knowing to some degree, so what do men need to do? I think they need to trust themselves more. They need to trust that you don't need to have the answers to find a way and that there'll be people around you who will offer you that spark of support and that the only way that we can start that is when we give permission to each other to follow that through.

Speaker 1:          25:40          So for every man to give another man that permission for every woman to meet that permission with care and compassion because it's not just a male thing. If we want our men to be protective leaders, then it's very difficult for them to be weak and vulnerable. Likewise, women want to be leaders as well, but at the same time the androgynous confused and, and I think that that's why we're having so many of these problems because it's a very simple process. Acknowledge how you feel. Tell some day, vocalize it, received the support, work up, support a move forward. It's not an atb experience, but it's certainly a place that begins the change we need to connect more. We choose not to is a choice. Everything's a choice. That's what we're choosing to do, which using not to. We're in a tender world, a throwaway world, a world where actually deep connection is something that's almost becoming avoided just because there is so much able connection that isn't really with those things are compromised and goes.

Speaker 1:          26:45          As human beings, you know, we used to be this kind of really small group of people as you would know and you know who did use things like divination, things that kind of made sense to them and in that community that worked effectively. We see that in the past and yet for some reason with materialism and capitalism and as you said, the politics and let's be honest, the place where it doesn't serve us to care for people because that's the wider discussion, isn't it? It doesn't serve people who are doing well to some degree to care for those who are not. And yet the answer is that that's the answer. And everyone who really thinks about it, I can see that. It curious how on a sort of a very basic level, things like eat the food that's in season in the place where you're living is like a sort of good for you because I like, they're sort of like, there's a sort of a little code that's all there.

Speaker 1:          27:36          So if a food's known season, it's haven't been transported, it won't be good for you. Like, so I wonder if there is an analogy with, like you said, with compassion and um, and sort of a subtler forms of feeling. And I wanted to ask you about sex and sexuality both as a therapist and as I am mother of both your sons, teenagers, teenagers, two teenage boys. So how do you. I'm like, you're a therapist. You produce, so like gender and sex. They were recovered with time where all of this stuff is being repoed and reexamined. And so like as a mother of two sons who are presumably at a point where these kind of ideas are integral, how do you, uh, what kind of instruction, what kind of work do you see your role? Um, in my role as a mom since day when it has to have conversations with them about everything.

Speaker 1:          28:35          And I mean it, I don't care who judges me for that. I don't care who judges me because at the end of the day I'll talk to them about porn. I've talked to them about what a girl will want on the first day and what she definitely won't want. I talk about the political standards that are given to women as far as their objectification of their bodies or sexualization of young girls. The expectations young girls put on themselves. I constantly tell them that they are essentially the future generation of young men and that they have to consistently accept that women girls are equals and I'm absolutely honest. I mean we'll still, I'm so honest, you know, they know what porn is. They know why porn exists. They know what that does some degree to women and they accept the things that they see if they see them. That's not real.

Speaker 1:          29:23          That's not what we're looking for in good relationships. Whatever you want in a relationship is great. Whatever suits your fancy, that's okay in a loving, committed, connected relationship or at least in a mutually respectful relationship. Mr. Do you think then that the porn is the sex? What our action movies to life and, and, and if so because I've started to think of porn is very sort of toxic and dangerous thing and I have a relationship with it. There's a bit like, you know, I find it hard to not look at pornography and it's one of the things I think that shouldn't look at porn. Porn is bad, but like if you like, but you also are you less puritanical kind of thing? I don't think that porn is necessarily bad because I think that it has a place in chain Cina. We're obsessed with bodies.

Speaker 1:          30:07          We like watching people have sex. We liked the fact that people have different interactions and fantasy is really important and particularly for men and women who like to have visual stimulus when that happened to masturbate, that can be really, really helpful for them. What I don't like about porn is it consistently places the woman on the whole as a submissive and it also suggests that women like certain things that I've never met a client particularly who likes the fact that 15 men are going to come on their face. I have to say that's not something that the average one wants, but that kind of footage is viewed again and again and again. Do you think that must be the men when looking at pornography? The fear must be a component. I'm getting if, if, if Paul needs to demonstrate men as being powerful, it seems to move it.

Speaker 1:          30:51          It might be catering for the fact that men feel impotent and powerless trying to redress that, so there's a an a bias in pornography to men being powerful because in effect men feel powerless and impotent and afraid. I think that's a really good way of describing it and when I feel almost like there's an underlying rage within porn when I see some of it, you know, when I constantly look online to see kind of what is being mirrored out there at the moment. No. So what expectations would be informed on 15 year old boys and girls are looking at the expectations and what they should want in relationships or in one night stands or whatever. I feel this like rage that it's almost like we have to abuse her. We have to destroy her to some degree. She has to enjoy it even though it's not clearly enjoyable and that concerns me, but it also suggests that there is some kind of change in the way that we are playing out our sexual fantasies.

Speaker 1:          31:48          I want people to realize that whatever your fantasy, that's okay. As long as it is respectful. As long as the other person is premium party to that, I'm willing to be within that fantasy itself. I don't think anybody should be afraid of exploring it. I constantly teach my clients that shame is the worst thing you can have in sex, and one of the things about porn is I think that's a big part of it. That same rage and shame that we almost play out these things on screen that are uncomfortable. Why is shame find its way into sexuality? Because we're shocked because we're ashamed of our sexuality early in life. I think that we are taught shamed so much in our society. I think from day one you are told that sex is bad. You can only do it at this age. You should only do it for this reason.

Speaker 1:          32:37          You should only do that with this protection that you kind of have this rhetoric already, but then at the same time, because we don't just have these really open, honest conversations when kids are growing up, you know, how often does somebody go into a classroom and talk honestly about sex? Talk honestly about relationships. So honestly about how good it is and how bad it can be so that you've kind of got rid of any need for the shame and you've engaged with everybody in a way that they can acknowledge they don't need to feel stupid or embarrassed or humiliated. We formed those norms because our mates at school are kind of making us feel that what we're doing, if we're having sex, it's promiscuous or what we're doing if we don't have sex, frigid. Those kinds of conversations occur because adults aren't guiding them. Like how do we help kids grow into young men and women who love sex and embraced it for what it is and feel no shame.

Speaker 1:          33:31          We do it by just being honest with them and people are horrified about that. I'll talk about on tv, I'll say, let's just start educating them from day one and people think you're stealing childhood, but you're not stealing childhood. Your creating solid allard. Adults who can become well adjusted in the way that they feel about sex. How can you do that sort of with a group? Because I suppose the reason that there's the, the, the suggestion or you're still in childhood is because it's like these children are not interested in sex and your imposing it on them, you know, so there's an argument of normally like around in a way enforcing and establishing norms around types of sexuality. Isn't it like in clause 28 being a famous example of like, Oh, don't teach kids that are almost sexuality is normal because otherwise they'll find out that it's normal.

Speaker 1:          34:22          So, uh, so I suppose the, how do you teach a group like a group of children because presumably there are children that have different expectations, levels of curiosity around sexuality. How can, how can you teach it? I think that you teach it early, really, really early. And when I say honestly, five years old onwards, I'm not talking about having sex at five years old. I'm talking about what sex is, how you arrive, why your born. That starts the beginning of the conversation by when kids. Because presumably what, when, when I was thinking about it before he was answering, I was thinking right when I would teach my kid about sex will be when the kid asks. No, I wouldn't talk about when they ask because children are full of fear children. I think that so many adults forget to look back to how it was, you know, I can remember clearly when I was four and five years old, I used to suffer from really terrible ticks as a child.

Speaker 1:          35:14          Like I had really, really bad touch which have been twitching about our terrible, terrible techs have every single one of them from linking. Next let's try to getting. And um, it was anxiety. It was a physical eyes. I didn't want to feel anxiety. So I use text to manifest that. And it was because I was so aware of everybody else's judgment around me. People would say things to me and open. Like I remember a guy saying to my dad, oh, she's such a funny girl that was there. I was far. I was five. And I've looked back on those times and always transplanted the recognition that these kids out there that everyone thinks it just these naive little players in life, they're hypersensitive, hypersensitive and they're having these conversations and they're worried about friendships and they haven't a clue why the world's working the way that it's working.

Speaker 1:          36:07          But you know what you can do. You can make them feel so safe. Adults can make kids feel so safe. When I was working on projects where the young people had had no education, where they were involved in the criminal justice system where people had completely given up on them. The first job that I had was to make my boys and girls feel safe because it was a feeling that everyone assumes people know, but very few people really know how to do it. By being authentic is number one. By reassuring them that they're okay. Even when some of that actions are not okay, that fundamentally within them there is an okayness that we can find that and we can manifest it and that they can move forward. My boys and girls and I say my boys more than my girls because my 80 percent of my boys came to the projects, about 20 percent were girls.

Speaker 1:          36:57          So I run um, crime concerned projects. I run college projects. It was Pru, pupil referral unit. So when kids had failed in mainstream education, they would come to me, but they would come to me after that failed in a mainstream pru. So I got the Pru, Pru, kids and I remember that. I remember my life that are low. That's wild though. Yeah, well I remember like those times with summer, I honestly in my head, summer, um, I still keep in contact with some of the young people if I'm honest. It's a long time since I worked on those projects, but what I recognized immediately was that they hated me when they first bought, they hated me. They were like, one called. I was called posh batch was number one, even though I'm not working class, but my accent was different to theirs, but it was okay.

Speaker 1:          37:43          So there's a scowl. If you've been kicked out, the thing that you go to when you're kicked out or things you might feel like audrey hepburn after rex Harrison is my fair lady, but you know what result, that was the key. The key to me was one, always being myself, always using the opportunity to inspire, not to take away my boys particularly. You had had their self esteem eradicate it to such a degree that but nine years old, they weren't in the classroom. They were sent outside to play. They didn't know how to read and why at 13, 14, 15, 16. If you can't read and write, you don't feel like you belong. You don't have access. Shamed. It's horrible and that's the other thing when you talk about academia as well. Academia is amazing. People are really bright. They seek out and suit themselves with that area of expertise and it's brilliant, but at the same time it creates a elite.

Speaker 1:          38:37          My boys would look at people in education, even people with gcse is let alone doctorates and professorships. They would see an us and them. My whole experience in life with my clients, with the young people I had the privilege to work with, with my children, I want it to be as an author. I want it to feel like there is no difference. We are human, therefore we're equal. I may know this and you may know that, but there is something intrinsic. I say to every single client that I have when they're questioning themselves more than nature, as you brought up nature before and everybody has their own opinions on this. Personally, I think nature has an answer for absolutely everything. I think she's incredibly bright and she knows exactly what she's doing and why she's doing it. Whether we see those solutions or choose to ignore them, whether politically we're allowed to have those solutions or have them with help from us.

Speaker 1:          39:28          That's the difference in that suggestion, you know, but one thing I know is that every single human being out of all these billions of people have one thing to print. I don't for one minute believe that mother nature decided to give every single human being a marketing so unique to them that that wasn't reason and purpose. I teach every single child that I ever worked with. Every client you were marked, you were marked with something that stands you out from every other person. Finding it is the issue. Finding it of beautiful. I think that that word communicate. It means create community. Create connection. Absolutely. So you're good at doing that. Then it was this thing up, so add to get rid of them. Terrible ticks, which is a phrase that when it first came out, I'm sure called Constellation in an audio medium that might be a new teller for show.

Speaker 1:          40:22          Actually terrible ticks presented by Mr Kenney with several ticks, but do self down. I'm higher, I terrible texture. I am still happy. Where's your, where are your tie control them? How sometimes I go to the toilet and I go back for a bit. I still have my texts I have is um, it's physicalized anxiety. So I'm quite, I would say I don't really feel low. I don't really feel anxious, but I'm aware that like anybody, I have a certain amount of stresses and strains in my world and my life, so my brain kind of just go, ah, just give yourself a bit of a twitch that's better than twitches and I do, you know what? I can still remember my mom when I was seven years old and I was quite a cute little kid with blonde pigtails, but mum was working class, but you know, a really, really great mother and she would put my hair in pigtails.

Speaker 1:          41:15          She put me in a red coat. She always coordinated everything. We didn't have a lot, but she made a real effort. Me and my sister would look like we were kind of quite well to do kids, you know, walking down the road and then I would cough, do my neck, do molag, throw my shoulders out and she would just look at me with absolute despair. There was a correlation between those two things with what Darwin you up or nice and you twitching eye out like some little punk. Back in the day. I didn't know how to verbalize my pain and at the time there were certain things in my life that felt painful and that was a way of using my body to express my sadness. I'm only learning now quite late in life. How muck of it being a person too much or in the intellect and the body is where so much happened.

Speaker 1:          42:01          So you go get into your body. Yes, yes. That's a big thing for me. That has been a huge learning curve for me. I used to analyze everything I used to feel that I had to work out every intrinsic piece and cellular experience that I had and it created so much noise and volume and what I've learned to do more recently is find this acceptance of silence and switching off and allowing myself to kind of meditate on how my body feels like how my body feels, not how my mind is and it's been so soothing and so helpful. Pop Mindfulness of course, isn't it? I'm like, I, um, like do Jujitsu and I'm probably one of the best people ask it in the world by one hour a week, one hour, where are like body. Yeah. I'm in my body and like sort of I'm physically close to another man wrestling.

Speaker 1:          42:51          It's sort of like, it's our love it what you said before about sex that is probably a really good way of describing how the perfect sexual encounter is. It's when you're not in your head is when you're fully engaged with your body. When you see yourself as playing and having pleasure and getting pleasure and having no shame and just allowing yourself the experience whether that's in a one night stand or a longterm committed relationship and it's possible and it's practical, but you have to work through all of that volume and get to a position where you accept your body before can move forward or how do you block the territory. It's a return to a point that we, uh, like we started. But then you sort of terrible ticks. And then for meditation like, you know, like introducing the subject of sexuality of children. You said don't wait for them to ask about it.

Speaker 1:          43:43          Start introducing this one. W, W how? Just have conversations with them. You know, from a very early age, I started to talk about the anatomy of my body, my children. I was a single mom for quite a long time, so as a single mom I had one bathroom in my home, which meant that my children always saw me naked, so I started to have conversations with them about my body so that they understood what my boobs were, what my vagina was. They still laugh at the word vagina because we really had fun back in the day discussing all of those things, the differences about that bodies then how they came about, why they existed, then what sex was and why it was and why sex is something that they should one day enjoy and always feel that I'm the person they can come and converse with the barrel, that both my boys are 13 and 15.

Speaker 1:          44:31          I don't know how I created them. There are a lot better than I probably deserved if I'm really honest. You know, they're great kids, but one of the things that strikes me about them is their emotional intelligence and they do not have fear. They do not have the fear that I had about asking, you know, my son will talk to me about porn. He'll talk to me about the fact that his friends are talking about sex. He'll have conversations with me about them and it's so, so reassuring because it was simple. It was simple. I just made the communication clear that there was no shame, no embarrassment. It was open. I think it's because you want imagines that it will not, you know, that child's going to go into an environment where, like in a moment ago, we were talking about the kind of what exists in the world of porn, the kind of access but young men, boys, girls are going to have to pornography.

Speaker 1:          45:21          But he's giving them some given a curious, um, usual on my assumption is dangerous messages are, how is your life, how do you feel as a therapist? Is My prejudices Mr Kenney human being. But how, how is like a sort of a natural understanding of sex, sex, Julie consensual, loving adult play where we communicate how like how's it going to survive that kind of institutional a deviation. I fully believe that human beings know how to find that way. I have a hope consistently. People say, how'd you work in certain circumstances? For example, with sexual abuse or with murdered children, you know, things like that that people would really struggle to work with. How do you work with it? And it's because I always have a sense of hope. My belief system is hope orientated. I think that no matter how much you present people with these caricatures, these characatures of sexuality, these characatures of having sex on screen in such a way that very few people would ever want to encounter.

Speaker 1:          46:28          In the end, we don't want it. We desensitize ourselves to it and we move on. I hope that women, if porn continues to hold itself in our society as it seems to be doing, I hope that women start to feel that they should be involved in directing and creating because fantasy is lost. There is no fantasy in that. It's so physical and mechanical. There has to be something deeper. Can I ask a question like, because we hear this idea of like, of course that is a one vision of female empowerment is women being involved in the creation of pornography, but in a sense isn't that a sort of coopting of femininity into a mountain bike because like you know when you sort of say, you know, to raise a May being prime minister, is that good for feminism? Was Margaret Thatcher being present? And of course it's good that women are in politics, but I feel like like it's not actually doing the job that we're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          47:25          I have a second. I would say, don't get me wrong, I would much rather what we have in our society is a far better relationship with sex. It's as simple as that. I wish that every young person growing up and every adult could learn early on to feel that their body is an incredible tool that something they can really relate to. They can enjoy that. We could have experiences in society where people can go to lessons and actually have sessions with people where they can really construct an identity with the sexuality, whether it was correct help for people who unfortunately have horrible sexual experiences. You know, the statistic is harrowing. One in six children are sexually abused before the age of 16, one in four girls, one in eight boys. That's real. So people are growing up with a dysfunctional identity towards sex. So a lot of it is the unraveling.

Speaker 1:          48:17          And when you say about porn, porn kind of volumizes the negatives as well. And I kind of wish that there was more regulation around that because I think you're never going to get rid of porn, but I'd like to see women as equal players because you get these really kind of stereotypical vibes about what women should want and it's turning the. I always thought, I know this sounds awful by. I say to people when I'm talking about sex, you never been talking to younger people. Don't expect anal sex and fisting when you have sex for the first time. That's not what women want and it's not what you should feel you're pressured to do, but if you're watching this kind of stuff and that's your learning experience, you absolutely think that that's a potential in the room scenario. What pressure for guys, what pressure for girls, so to some degree it's the regulation, but will that ever happen?

Speaker 1:          49:07          Of course not because it makes a lot of money and money will always be the bigger winner in life is extraordinary. The way we have to incorporate these external influences on what is governing the flow of what is normal, what's determining normality. It's interesting when something comes up as a a, a, a bowl. The word in a podcast as listing. No, not at all. Please don't apologize for it. Of course. Like I record, like I once heard about when there was earlier attempts to regulate the pornographic content for fisting was one of the things that they looked at without considering the role that that plays in nonheterosexual communities. I'm like, sorry. So regulation can often be used as a tool to normalize as opposed like when we're having open conversations about what sex is, what sex should be, but it's very important that that remains open and inclusive and nonjudgmental about different types of sexuality and the thing that I heard that made most sense to me was consent, consent, consent, and who can't give consent, children and a more mentally ill people.

Speaker 1:          50:18          Yeah. I think though that the whole porn area, it's one of those places that could have purpose, if that makes sense. Could be something that could inspire or it could be somebody that could free years and allow us our fantasies, but to some degree the fact that a lot of people feel intense. Shame watching porn plays into that dark psyche anyway. So I would like to see more people just normalizing the conversations around sex, about talking about that preferences, about expressing their fantasies without fear. I think there's so much fear built up within the sexual arena.

Speaker 2:          50:53          And Kenny, thank you very much because I think communication is going to be vital in all areas of mental health, all forms of human expression. Verbal and sexual and it feels to me like the way that we relate to our feelings, the way that we relate to forms of expression is vital in this time of disjunct, in this time of Fisher separation conflict in so many fields like you know, to once again find union, but between people that no matter only I suppose start with communication. What an incredible journey it's been. It seems for you from a great communicator to communicate. I think you should have your own podcast and that should be the strap sex talk obviously will be the title wherever Kenny, but the strap from what was that a true and it's a congruent communicator. Brilliant. Listen, thank you so much. Thanks for coming.
