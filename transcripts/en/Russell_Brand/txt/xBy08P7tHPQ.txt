Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Thank you for downloading under the skin with me, Russell brand. Here's that bit where I start asking you to do stuff. Could you go a pod survey.com, forward slash brand and fill in a survey. You might win some kind of voucher. You probably won't be. We'll feel good about yourself and because you give us a five star review please. Particularly. Well, I mean I prefer genuine ones, but we will take fake ones. It helps us to glean power and may help us to at some point get a sponsor, but for now under the skin with Russell brand is sponsored by me, Russell brand. Come and see me on my rebirth tour. It's good stuff. You know you're gonna. Love it. Particularly keen for you to come. If you want to see me in woking on the third of my Oxford on the 10th of May, southport on the 23rd or may or ausberry on the sixth of June. What foot on the seventh of June or skegness on the 15th of June. If you want tickets to that, go to Russell brand.com. There are other data available, but we particularly need to sell those ones under the skin is sponsored by Russell brand, rebirth tour under the skin. Have a look, but never smelled it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Today's guest is Adam Curtis do now. Adam Curtis. Have you seen hypernormalization his new film? Did you watch that thing better leg? Did you see the power of nightmares? Did you see century of the self, the Mayfair set? I've seen all them things and that is why a much more clever than what you are in this episode of under the skin. I talked to Adam about what all manner of things actually, but he's a brilliant political mind. If you want to understand what's going on in the boat, trump, brexit, terrorism, the way that media news narratives or contrived conspiracy theories, what their value, then you could do a lot worse than to watch Adam courtesies films. I've become friends with him actually, and I find them to be an absolute darling man. Do you know? You may not know that he was actually made films for that life and that if you're a person that's about my age who were born in the seventies or eighties, you meant protocol.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       That's life of restaurants and where she would get sort of like, you know, good news type stories like a dog. Don't start talking. The same sausage is sort of pap mindlessness, what Adam coast made that, but he went on to be one of the great narrators of our complex media age. If you're an American listener and not familiar of Adam's work, you want to get familiar with it right now by checking out his blog. But, uh, he's a fantastic storyteller on great sort of cultural events such as a leaner, like defining events such as nine slash 11, the grip of the Berlin Wall coming down and it gives us an interesting perspective there. Check out his stuff. Check out this interview, remember to go and give me a nice positive review. You're listened to Russell brand under the skin. I've been giving you your intro the whole time that you've been shambling through the corridor. It's like a gray ghost laundry like Jacob Marley,

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       with the chains being your own archive, saying most wonderful things about hypernormalization. What do you mean that we're living in an unreal world as some sort of simulate? What do you mean by it? What is the point of this film? Hypernormalization. Tell us what you mean.

Speaker 3:          00:03:17       What I remember happening, I mean it's done. What I meant by hypernormalisation is that it got the term comes from a guy rather than just guy who write about what it was like to live in the Soviet Union. That late in the middle of the 19 eight is where the Soviet Union was collapsing because it wasn't really any protest at the time, but what he pointed out he is that everyone knew that everything was not right. They knew that those in control had no control. They knew that those running the economy, we're not in control, that everything was corrupt and often completely faked because the leaders were pretending they were in control. Everybody knew this and the leaders knew that. Everybody knew this, but nobody did anything about it because there was nothing else. It was normal and he coined the phrase hypernormalization to describe this, but somehow you knew that everything was a bit odd and a bit unreal and often fake, but because there was no other picture of the world and you were so within this system, you accepted it as normal and just went on and what I'm trying to argue in this room is not in any way.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       We're like the Soviet Union were a very different society, but what we do share with that time is a sense among a lot of people that things are a bit odd, an unreal and sometimes fake and those in charge know that they're not in charge and they know that. We know they're not in charge of things, that everything is a bit chaotic, uncertain. We distrust everyone in charge. We also know those in charge allow a great deal of corruption to carry on without doing much about it. We know that they're not in control of their economy and they know we're not in control. They know that. We know they're not in control of the economy and in that's, but at the same time we. We are so much a part of that system that we don't have any vision of an alternative, and I include by that the left, the people who argue that they do want to change things, they don't have a vision of an alternative. So we accepted as normal. So when you, when you see another newspaper article coming out saying, Oh look, they were actually supplying arms to the Yemen to allow the Saudis to bomb Yemen. We go, yeah, well we sort of expect. Yeah man,

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       I know what you mean because I did hear that we were supplying arms to the Saudis to bomb Yemen. They have a day on a four. Oh yes. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       A very good example. The reaction is the most interesting thing of our time. We sort of expected the, the, the arms industry and the government in this country would allegedly allow arms to be supplied to this war that we know is causing horrific civilian deaths and we have no way of controlling it. We know that and we just accepted it's normal, but actually it's wrong, isn't it? But we know that however much we feel it might be wrong, nothing's going to change.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Is it a condition of five? Normalization then Adam impotence.

Speaker 3:          00:06:23       It is impotence in the face of a chaotic world. We think that was in charge. I have no control over, but we accept it. So it's not just impotent, it's we're passive and we accepted. So in a way we are as complicit in it as our leaders, but but we do that because no one has gives us any alternative. We accept it as just normal. When the thing, when you have an alternative, you can see suddenly something. It puts it in perspective. You've got an alternative, you see, you see things truly for what they are, and you can pull back, detach and go, I don't like that this is better or you don't. At the moment there isn't an. I think one of the great faults lies with the left who say they do one change. I mean the real changing moment is coming from a strange, weird mixture of right wing nationalism and racism as far as I can see. Yes, but they're failing to offer any alternative.

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       Yes. Alternative visions is that what you're saying is that the alternative visions are always going to come from the periphery or from the subculture and that the left is unable to provide a legitimate and genuine alternative. There are in fact involved in it

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       rhetorical exchange. Now it feels more and more like rhetoric. I mean, I. I point out in the film how strange it is that in the recent years, all the attempts to change the world radically, which had a great deal of force behind them. The occupy movement, the Arab spring and tire square in particular in Egypt, seretse in Europe, all of stalled. They had great power behind them. They had great goodwill behind them and they stalled and I argue in the film, it's because they confuse process with content that they did. They they assembled. They were very powerful. They had a great slogan behind them in the occupy movement, great deal of emotional goodwill from people who would not normally support revolutionary movements and they just stopped.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       So what I said that sounds. There's two things. One, it tells us the, the, the, the bleak observation one can make is that there is no coherent, clear alternative vision, but the other thing is that there is a desire for change. That's the positive thing that we can draw from that, that when all put their mouse or whatever rises up in those cases from, I suppose I'm more close to there, to the left, if not a traditional leftist movement because it's embracing technology and sort of populism. In some ways it seems novel if not entirely new. Uh, there, there is a genuine appetite for it. Yes. What do you imagine Adam is the, what, what is the problem that, what I mean in a way, why

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       would we expect if the world is changing as radically as it is, if it's a result of technology and sort of a racing or rapidly advancing economic realities that are conventional and traditional left would be the answer. Why would we imagine that? I mean, in a sense, these are centuries old ideas that have not been modified it because we're no longer living in a version of 20th century capitalism are we. So why would like so why would a 20th century socialism be a response to it? In a way, I argue in the film where I try and demonstrate journalistically in the film that we know we're not living in the old idea of capitalism than we used to think about. What we've shifted into is a a new system of power, which I see as being fundamentally managerial. It's the reverse new bureaucracies around us, including things on the Internet, but also in finance and in and in management systems in all the closest that many people work in.

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       The aim is to essentially keep the world staple. I mean that's what finance is desperate to do it. It's always wanting to monitor the world. Looking for risk. Risk is a fascinating word. I, I. This is Oregon. I did a word search on Lexisnexis, which is the cuttings filed of all newspapers up until about 1988, 1990. The word risk hardly features in German, so obviously there and then suddenly in the nineties it rises up and it's this what drives modern managerial capitalism. If you can give it a word like that is this desire to avoid instability, to analyze the past, look for patterns that are happening now that looked like dangers in the past and then adjust that. There's always a sort of a right thing to be, and I. I see it in our own personalities as well. There's always a right way to be psychologically.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       There's always a right body mass index to have. There is always the right stable thing to be understand. Now I'm going to insert for like first availity. One can place conservatism keep things the way they are. Stop things from changing over that necessarily mean conservative in the conventional political conservative party. I mean don't let things change and for risk, the tool that's being used to preserve this basis it fear is a synonym. So the fear is being used. Fear of change. Yes, that's it's very deep. Not just within the conservative mindset, but also within the liberal mindset in our society is fear of change. Look what happens when you try and change things. They point to Iraq for example. Look what happens when you try and change a country. They point to nature and they say, look what happens when you try and change an ecosystem.

Speaker 3:          00:11:39       You can never tell the consequences of it. And then they point back and they go, well, look what you try and do with the Russian revolution. Look what happened there. So you always have this constant being blind. Look what you tried to do the, Oh no, I'm sorry, but what they ignore is the fact that you live in a society that comes out of a revolution which has got fantastic and wonderful freedoms at it. It we had a revolution in this country. It can be good, but it can be dangerous at the moment. We live in a static world where were absolutely terrified of all change. Whereas someone like me would argue is the change can be dangerous, but can also be thrilling.

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       Yes, of course. No, of course. Someone like he would argue that. Now, what I think is very interesting about what you're saying Mr Curtis is that, um, is that when I listened to the arguments that can be sort of rather complex on the things I very much enjoyed about your films, is there the accessibility and the populism probably coming from your inaugural sausages, the movie in which a deluxe says sausages or seems to because Mr Darcy, she revealed to me that the man manipulates the docs larynx. So the, they'll probably wouldn't have said so. I suggest if left alone long enough. Well, I think what is the ultimate resource if all of these things, and don't be afraid of a little bit of comedy, Adam Curtis, is that a little pal? Allow the GNOMIC peculiar presence, the Elfin presence of mischief to be present in the room. Allow a tender law to, to advance up your thigh high school, the on pondering whether you use comedy as a way of defense.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       I use it as a means for attack as a matter of fact. So what, what I was saying is, is that all of these things come from the personal. But when you talk about keep things like, because one of the themes of your ipad normalization is we're saying, oh well, who's like, you know, the politicians aren't powerful. That's one of the great tropes of our age. It doesn't matter if you switch out cameron for Theresa May or indeed anybody, because there's a self seems to be some self regulating system that asserts stability regardless of what a opposing force a place in this way. Now we're like, Ooh. Then is a certain. There's power. Where is this power upon which we can't get any purchase that evidently isn't the political establishment as we understand it. Where is this power actually situated? Would you say? It's as simple as that. You know, follow the money is the great economic interests. Global economic interest. This is a good place to start as any. I think it's

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       John bureaucracies are grown up which are intimately related to our politics like finance. I mean, the interesting thing about the 19 eighties is everyone thinks that Thatcher Reagan really were successful. But actually if you look back and increasingly historians looking back and go, no, they weren't they, they came in saying they're going to regenerate industry. But by about 1986, 87, most of the industry is in Britain and America had collapsed because of the economic experiment. So what factor and Reagan did was they said they turned to finance and they said, can you help us? I mean this is effectually what happened. And what finance did said is, well, we'll lend the money. Wages weren't going up, wages. We're actually collapsing at that point. So what happened is you had a switch and they gave power to finance and finance came in an introduced the idea of lending on a much grander scale. And the politicians allowed that because they facilitated all sorts of new acts of parliament

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       that allowed for that to happen. So what you've got is a shift away from the idea that you are on a constant travelator have increased wages, increased security in the industries you worked in, the, the, your income stagnated. And it was supplemented by lending money. So finance, for example, I've got a great deal of power now. Underlying finance is a deep desire to keep the world stable, to avoid chaotic situations. So we began to move into that world where we're always trying to avoid risk. What then that happens is that that idea begins to spread out, not just literally in terms of you lending money, but the idea avoiding risk becomes a central thing in our society and I would argue that we've all become terrified of change. I. One of the things that I've sort of. She's conservative, yes, of course, of course. One of the things I've intuited, but not yet fully articulate it because I imagine it's rather complex and have a tendency to be a bit sort of a ad hoc shoot from the hip of spit from the lip ask questions later.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       Type of a character is that Qa chaos and their use of chaos is required. That there's this sense in me that the induction of chaos will be beneficial when looking at this sort of contemporary politics. I've felt as you have articulated and from my own experience with the truth and one of the reasons I was very keen to have you as a guest as a matter of fact, that is of course like a sort of like waist deep in like the political discourse, get an ed miliband round the flat and interviewing him and sort of being very outspoken in what became a very combatative. And uh, what I want to say dialect it kind of difficult exchange with Britain's media particularly, is that I felt like this is really hard to get any traction. It felt. I felt very quickly myered, you know, and like being around like the political class.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       It will be briefly around Ed miliband and the cheeks. It felt like this doesn't seem like it. It felt like a very sort of a kind of jangly and neurotic sort of Coterie of people I didn't think like, oh, this is the advancement of power. And then from being the recipient of the kind of, um, uh, sort of, uh, what I would say a curtailing of managing forces from the media. That was interesting as well. It felt like it's so interesting to become the subject of such negativity, not only from sort of established media but from people in general because when you talk about change, when you talk about chaos, when you talk about letting you know, like people like it's very interesting like what I felt like he's like in the story of the emperor's new clothes is like that. In the end you'd say that kid just shut up.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       Stop saying that about the emperor parades like the in the. And people get angry to let people get angry with you. If you say something like, right, doesn't make any difference who you vote for, you'll get the same political system anyway. People know that's true and they know it's wrong. And so they become angry with in this case me for saying it instead of like sort of thinking, well bloody hell that is a pain in the ass. But that's reality that that's true. Or you know, so. So what, you know now I find myself interested in sort of bigger and broader topics like you know, both historically and sort of a,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I know historically history. I think what is likely to be the next transition given that you know, liking your film hypernormalization and like you've just said, it seems that the political world is at least a once removed narrative that doesn't seem to respond to protests, doesn't seem to respond to activism. It merely absorbs, it digests seretse, presumably pajamas. It can handle the occupy movement and as you've said in a in hypernormalization than in other aspects of your work that people that have got an established idea, which usually comes from religion, like the, the, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. When people can go, look, we have got an idea. It's this, it's fundamentalist Islam. That those, those ideas are more potent and powerful. What do you think that we can learn from that with take from that,

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       but you see, I think that why it doesn't have any traction change. It's our fault as much as them. You can't just blame the politicians. It's us as well. One of the great, enormous changes of our time is the rise of individualism is the. It started really in the 19 seventies in modern terms and it's this idea that you and I believe that what we want and what we think and what we feel is the only authentic thing and we shouldn't be told what to do by people. It's really strong. It's really powerful and it's it, it. Mrs Dutcher was on the coat tails of it. Punk movement was on the coat tails of it. It was. It's really it. It dominates our society and the problem for politics of the rise of individualism is that it can't deal with it. Politics requires you to say to people as a political party, come with me, join with us together and we will use that collective power to change the world.

Speaker 3:          00:19:38       But to do that you have to accept that you're part of something. You have to surrender yourself to something. And for the radical movements, that was a disaster, but more than that, it was a disaster for politics generally because political parties understand fell away. So what? Then politicians there. Let me finish what politicians being aggressive. Jeremy Paxman no, this is. This is important thing, which I don't think because it's not just the politicians. What they were then faced by is the fact that they didn't have mass support, so they couldn't do the main thing that mass democratic politics rose up to do, which is to be your representative, your bridgehead into power. Because we had become like scurrying little piglet. It's going all over the world and not have become a Skyrim piglet. I've been a strident cantaloupe and not joining together to form a collective action.

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       I understand that. Now what? There's one thing I wanted to pick up on that. When you say something that Adam. This is a popular podcast, right? So when me say something like the rise of individualism, what you're, what you're saying is that like, you know, I think we can all say that I primarily my worldview comes from, but I'm me, I'm Russell, I want this. I don't like that. I've got. Right. So I've got feelings now like in that that's something that people haven't really examined individualism as a component and a sort of an unavoidable evolution of a mechanistic worldview and of materialism. Now we're like, what are you saying? Like when they became chronic or more noticeable in the seventies, so my assumption would be then that these conditions of individualism is a side effect of marketing of liked, but the reason why is it convenient for people to see themselves primarily as individuals because that's how people really are better.

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       No, it's not a side effect of marketing marketing comes in to make it work. Individualism comes basically out of the hippie movement, the counterculture movement to the 19 sixties where you were encouraged to be authentic by responding to yourself. That was the idea and it was a reaction against what was seen as conformity and it was a reaction against old style of politics where you were told what to do. It was just, I want to do what I want to be. You know? It was just that. That's what happened and it was about finding the authentic self. Yes, but that was a

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       the defined as much as anything else, bites, cohesion and bias, this pursuit of civil, civil liberties. These were people that were were like a lot of change came out of that. On a, on a civil rights level in the United States, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:11       That's absolutely true, but that didn't come out of the hippie movement, the civil rights movement, which is incredibly important movement. In the 19 fifties in the 19 sixties, white activists and black activists joined together and they spent years giving their lives and many cases literally up to try and change the world, which they did and they surrender themselves to that. Out of that civil rights movement came what was called the new left and the new left said, well, if we can do this for civil rights, we can do this for everything. And then the movement stalled somewhere in the mid 19 sixties because what began to happen was I knew what was called counterculture rose up and the counter culture was different for the new left because what the counterculture said was, you're never going to check all the man the power. You haven't got the power to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:58       The way to do it is to change yourself. It was the rise. It was the. It was the sign of a new individualists and it didn't want to be part of it. Didn't want to go down to the south and spend years at an anonymity in danger, trying to change the world. It wanted to change. Here. I don't want to go down to south New York named Ian Danger. If I might say say you are an arch example of hyper individualism of our time. I find that I'm going to write that down or look out when I get in. All your responses are characteristic of exactly what I'm describing. So what then happened is that the, the the argument shifted away from the idea of saying we can work together to change the world to saying no, if we can actually be be the vanguard of changing ourselves as people.

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       Then you change the Saatchi like that. You change the people first and then society will transform and that sort of work for a bit, but then bit by bit the politics moved away and you are left with this idea. You just transform yourself and you have all these radical psychotherapy movements of the 19 seventies come up, which is you need to find your authentic feelings. That became the goal and the idea that you actually changed his society as a byproduct began to disappear, and what then happened was that this strange thing began to emerge is if you are going to be a self expressive individual, which was the ultimate goal, where you're authentically expressing yourself, how'd you do it? Because actually not many people knew or had the confidence to do that, and I argued in a series of films I made that that really what happened was the modern consumer capitalism said, we can help you do that. We can actually supply you with lots of different things to allow you to express yourself from ranges of cost ranges of close to all sorts of products that you can use to express your individual identity. Which was fantastic for consumer capitalism because they could make lots more different things.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       Yes, but you're not saying then that consumer is like that. You're saying that the consumer is in mass market culture was a response to that need? Yes. That's interesting. I like because I'm, as you know, a fan of the films of century of the Self, which doesn't qualify me to know more about them. In the new [inaudible] you've made those films but like what it means, but what how I see, I said, look, on one level we're deal the source material for all of this is human beings feeling so even when you say something like, I'm an arch example of individualism. For me that means that I'm closer to to the precipice of breaking through to realizing the limitations of individualism and what the implications of the individualism is. Limits are which is transcendence. What happens when one, once more transcends willingly and with volition through the limitations of individualism and back to a communal experience and back to a cohesive experience as a member of a tribe have a community of a society.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       Experiences that are somewhat the night as a pathway to somewhat being dug up. It's not so. It's no longer clear what is the direction for people that feel this yearning and feel the limitations of our experience of individuals of forever living in our head, of living, in our anxieties of not knowing what is real because we are living in a very limited version of what is real, the fulfillment of our base drives and base desires. That's a limited experience of being human. Who Will, who, oh, anthropologically history historically are designed to live communally connected as a harmonious part of a group in a harmonious part of nature. And what's interesting for me about what you sit there, Adam, is the. I've always regarded the consumerism and mass market culture, uh, has recognized all right, there's this need in people that can be fulfilled through selling them stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       But by you know, by your own unique ipad, ipad, Ipod, by your own unique torn jeans, participate in culture and expressive individualism for consuming. But I suppose what we've not yet gotten to is the, the architecture of these concepts if phenomena. Like, do you think there's someone behind it designing this or, or some interests. Because like when you're saying these bureaucracies are organizing this state system stability, like the financial bureaucracy, you know, who benefits from this, who benefits from people seeing themselves primarily as individuals because it certainly isn't the people of the Yemen and it certainly isn't us as individuals. So who is it that's preventing change from happening? Yes, of course. Ask because we can say we're not participating in a, in a, in a like a potent movement because one doesn't seem to currently exist, but what is the. What is. Why is this idea continuing to dominate?

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       I think the point is depart consumer capitalism is capitalism is not a. there's nothing inherently evil thing. It's a, it's a moral. It will always spot an opportunity and it will go for it. And what it spotted in the late 19 seventies that were there were these people rising up who wanted to be themselves and they realize that that allowed you to make lots of a much wider range of products that you have previously done before and people went for it and that allowed capitalism to make lots more money and become much more. You know, you saw those adverts in the 19 eighties, 19 nineties, express yourself, be yourself through Nike. Just do it exactly because I'm worth. It was the great phrase, but then what happened was I think a great shift happened, which we haven't fully recognized, which is of what I'm trying to get out of the film is that is the genius of modern power, is that it managed to do what politics failed to do.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       Politics can't deal with individualism because how can you have a political party where everyone wants to be an individual and not be part of something? What modern manager or system has managed to do with square the circle? Look at modern social media. It manages to allow you to feel that you are totally yourself expressing yourself online, typing it angrily or beautifully or whatever you want to do out into the, into the Internet what you feel or the time yet at the same time, what you are as a component and a series of very complex circuits that is looking at you. Doing that and saying, I'm on. If he's doing that, then he's very much like these people over here, which we've categorized like that, so we can say back to that person in the circuit. If you're doing that, would you like this as well?

Speaker 3:          00:29:11       And you go, whew. All right, because it's a bit like what you've just done and it makes you sort of feel secure within your individuality. So what they've finished to do increasingly in the modern systems of management is except your individualism and your expressiveness allow you to feel that you're being more and more expressive. Where's the same time managing you quietly, unhappily, so you become part of a very large group. That university because you are just the little components and the circuit, but the computers look at you and go, oh, well there's about 300 million of those sort of types. We're putting them in that group and I'm not a conspiracy. It's not a group of people going, Oh, we'll do this. It's a system that can see from the information that it's reading from you and lots of other people, the patterns that you are part of and saying, well, we'll fit them all together into that pattern.

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       Absolutely. So sort of complex interlocks, taxonomies that designed ultimately to go, if you like this, your property,

Speaker 3:          00:30:08       that it's benign in terms the. If you talk to the tech utopians from from Silicon Valley, they will go, this is incredibly efficient and they're right. It's an incredibly efficient way of managing the problem that politicians can't manage, which is our individuality and our desire to be self expressive. It's problem is, is that it's fundamentally conservative because it's feeding back to you more of what it knows you like or things will change. Yeah, but it sounded like a bit like Christianity in a way offered a kind of have a peg around personal interaction with Christ. Your own person or salvation Christ loves you as an individual. Yes. You could argue that modern protestantism especially was again, another way of trying to deal with the growing desire for individuality, which has been going on since the renaissance or before the enlightenment decide. Did you want to be yourself?

Speaker 3:          00:31:03       So question to some said, no, you don't have to be what Catholicism says is just part of something you're told to do. You can have a personal relationship to God and there is a very important posh academic book written back in the early part of the 20th century which argues, but my uncle Max Faber that argues that protestantism and the idea that you have a personal relationship to God was one of the great motor forces that allowed capitalism to come up because if you can actually achieve a relationship through your own actions with God and achieve salvation, then you can actually say what? I can achieve all sorts of things myself in the here and now before I dive, which may save me for when I die. So it actually made you more of a heroic figure. Protestantism certainly that advances the idea of individualism used their sort of star of your own life accruing goods and services so that when you and when you die, you will, you will be a good person and you will go to heaven and that gave capitalism this idea that it was a fundamentally good thing to try and achieve you where we will work, and you'll see this in the 19th century novels where they depict great capitalists.

Speaker 3:          00:32:12       They see themselves as heroic figures who are not only helping the world, but they're saving themselves. Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       I suppose in a way don't we have to get beyond the kind of a journalistic judgment so of like ideas like capitalism, socialism or any individual is either good or bad sort of is it that we need to sort of look up functionally what's occurring or like this seems to have very positive results. This seems to very detrimental results and when you're talking about this online collation and people put together into 300 million man or woman hurts, that can be marketed to and as you say, it's benign. These things, not this not happening in a vacuum is there is like, so when you're talking to these that that is the exertion and that's the ex, that's the exercising of power. We're witnessing witnessing there, Adam, that's not happening sort of in a arbitrary and natural light because the people's interests are being represented through those resources.

Speaker 2:          00:33:06       Facebook is not neutral. One of the things that I'm sort of learning about because you know, I'm going to university, she very kindly wrote me my reference which have not yet seen and I would like to see because I want to know what kinds of things you said about me and sweet and adorable, sweet and adorable students. I hope that I'm right now looking at the context you're using that in. It makes me think that you fought sweet and adorable. It was patronizing which, uh, I suppose in a way it is, but it's also being nice is patronizing. Then I'm patronizing. So in one of the things I'm learning about in that Adam Curtis is a, like the way that secularism. And just so for those of you that were new listener to this type of podcast, the division of Church and state, that division of political interest and religious interest has always posed as I neutral force like addicts, expansionism and interventionism has been justified by that we can go over to Iraq and stick our origin because we are a secular society, a neutral society, and they're doing all sorts of Wacko stuff with that where the government has got a mustache and metal from that and they need to be brought down to people to now this a positive as neutral of a, whether it's secularism or the sort of cyber world is one of the ways that power has always concealed itself by saying this isn't power tool, this is normal, you know, sort of social services, normal markets.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       So sort of a sort of a capitalism derived from protestantism, normal Islam not normal. And therefore subject to regulation. The threat someone wants to the great the, the sign of a great ideology is something that doesn't look like an ideology that you just accept as natural and normal. So for example, if you talk to technological enthusiasts or utopians from Silicon Valley, are you talking about facebook shutting people off into their own little echo chambers, but they'll say, but it's sufficient and what they mean by that is it works. It's actually dealing with the problem I was talking about of individualism and it's allowing people to be assembled in groups yet feel individuals and they're absolutely right. It is incredibly efficient. But maybe the whole idea of efficiency used in those terms is actually a political ideology because what they're saying is we constantly keep people in this situation by reading stuff and feeding stuff to them. And that's conservative. That's a conservative idea because then people but get get, they'd get frightened of change and if you get frightened of change then you are actually feeding the power. And what I keep

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       on trying to point out in this film is the real power works not just, it doesn't work by saying you must do this, it works well when we are complicit within it because we accept it as natural. Yes. And we are guilty of that. So for example, do you remember the, the um, March against the war in Iraq and in London in 2003. I think it was about 3 million people went on that march was terrible. Did you go on it?

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       I was still on drugs to care about that actually. I think I did go, but it was still on drugs to care about it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       But the interesting thing about that march is it was really the biggest, probably the biggest protest march since the suicide thing in 1956 or even bigger. And everyone thought that's going to change everything. Yeah. And then everyone went and they had a slogan which was not in my name, which is again a very individualistic like it as a slogan to you. Well, I'm not in my name, you know, but it's the wild doubt my finishing your name I think because we've got some more lemonade we got. Okay. I suppose it was an interesting slogan of its time. I don't know how the pomposity of it sincerity you. Everyone marched 3 million people march and they were totally sincere about it. Not In my name. And they then went home, all right, it's not in your name. And they said, well, that's not important. Well, that's exactly what what the profession was. You go back and the war is not in my name. That's not what you don't anything more about it. Whereas real change, real political change would have happened if those 3 million people had again and again and again marched and again and worked and given themselves to that they might. What I've had a chance of stopping. The horror has now happened in Iran.

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       It's a bit of my Adam, I've heard you argued before, the stability is the enemy of change and we are obviously participants in this because we like, oh, do you know what? I don't know if I will be going on a million person March every day because I've got an x box and I'm moderately comfortable. Isn't in fact the ingenuity of a much of contemporary secular life is that we're for the significant majority. We are sustained at a comfortable level and we can tolerate in our insular cells of comfort the discomfort of others. Because our empathy and altruism has been eroded, these impulses and instincts have long been undernourished because they're sort of familiar. Communal institutions of themselves began to disappear. What protest becomes feeling? Well, it, yes it does add him and actually that shouldn't be to our disadvantage because when you sort of talk about me as the arch narcissist of our time on what I think this means is it's like that for all things.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       Returning to the point makes my point for me that you are the narcissist of our time. I did it as a passing comment.

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       No, because, um, it's something that I'm, I'm interested in because I actually think it's legitimate as well as this sort of a blip aside, you know, that sort of, what is it about my, my personal conditions and the conditions of our time that make soaks,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       that make me so infatuated with my cell phone, my own perceptions because in a way, how is that different from, you know, really from anybody else. It's not really, it's more pronounced, it's more observable. I don't imagine that. It's not like, you know, how could anyone possibly know because no one except me knows how to be inside my own consciousness and I'm not even sure that I'm that convinced of how to do it. That my point, my point is, is that everything's a source is people's negotiation with the external world at source. Everything is the way I feel when I'm interfacing with a society or another human being or a product or my own feelings coming back to me and because I have experienced many of the sort of the sort of the icons of success or the icons of consuming, you know, have been famous being a proper drug.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       Addicts being proper, promiscuous. I've like seen, oh right, these things are not that nutritional or that helpful is that he's helped me to reach a point where I'm willing to consider ideas such as being part of a community, you know, and like isn't that is law. That means surrender. Right. You know, sort of like the idea of surrender comes up again and again in a sort of spiritual and religious ideologies that these drives. In fact, it was the other one said to me like, you know, like a, we've been told that freedom is freedom to fulfill, are trivial and petty desires, but real freedom is freedom from our petty and trivial desires. But you know, in being able to sort of by yourself an iphone or have a Wang in a train toilet, you know, think of this as a kind of blissful utopia. But what have you just fobbed yourself off with? In my case, it was a 10 pound fine.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       No fear. So serious. Why are you being so serious today? What I decided. You're the funny guy, so that doesn't matter. We can all, we can all be silly together. You know, what are the lights? So the reason I'm using like returning to make a serious point at that point, that's what I was working serious is because. No, no, no. Because you've touched on something really important to note that there are to calm you down. Honestly necessary. I consider this a form of resuscitation. This is, this necessary was if you were lying on a beach now. So we are all clever in those edits with your archive, but really what he needs is a cuddle that come on. I think I'm actually trying to show that I don't want to be controlled by your comedic persona. Power of comedy is very controlling messages. That's what I.

Speaker 3:          00:41:05       my point is, and I am as much a narcissist as you. I want to set the agenda as well, right? What I want you to see that that's the trail and what I wanted to point out was that it's not that there is the real kind of freedom isn't. It's a religious one. It's a different kind of freedom. There are all different kinds of freedom and the idea of freedom that we believe in now and we believe is inevitable or natural and natural to state is not. It's a construction. The version of us at the moment is a country of freedom is a construction because there are many others and one of the most powerful is the very opposite, which is a religious one which says in whose service is perfect freedom. Is that what the religious idea is that the self which we worship at the moment is actually a terrible prison.

Speaker 3:          00:41:55       It's a cage that you are trapped and again, you are an example of this in and in what you've taught them. A terrible presentation is that when you give a young offenders, when you get trapped atriox short term desires, it's a cage. You've got, you got locked acuitus. I mean even your logically one could imagine that the process of consuming is this stimuli and response. Maybe it's good to escape from that daily grind of having to listen to your consciousness constantly saying, I want this. I want this, I want this. Which we're encouraged to believe is liberation. Yeah, maybe it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       No, I think you're quite right. I mean, when I like, I like Eva, I'm sort of quite pop spiritual orators such as Eckhart Tolle will say to you that this incessant in a narrative, the relentless thinking, there's no freedom in that, you know, in some and watched where those thoughts take you. Sometimes. You know, I sort of, I'm, I'm, I'm walking my dog in the field, so everything's basically not the reality. This material reality is I am a man in a field with a dog. I mean in my head, what's happening is, Oh God, what did I do that for? This will probably go wrong. What's going to happen? Who are those people over there, but I'm not trying to stick again. He keeps bringing it back, you know? So that is that there is like a sort of a self imposed tyranny to that and I don't, you know, and obviously like you have just a sort of implied capitalism or consumerism or modern culture, whatever the hell it is, isn't gonna solve that. In fact it perpetuates that would. Because the interesting thing about time is you're right,

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       people live inside their heads very much because they're encouraged to. They're encouraged to think that is, that is the end point. That's what we're heading towards. Yeah. But, but actually what's going on in those heads of things that people don't really want to tell who all the sorts of things theory, learning a stout. Because actually if you are going to be the right kind of individually, don't have that, you mustn't have that and you see this on social media at the moment. Everyone, the, the politician who is going to get real power and take us somewhere in the future, it's going to have to deal with the things that are inside our cubs, which is loneliness and fear.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       I'm lonely. Fright. I woke up this morning. I was so lonely. I'm a tell you something else. God. I was shit scared. It took me. I'll give you a bloody pajamas on. Foreign knew it was sad. I'm lonely. I'm understand is coming down. Bloody wanted me. Slippers fallen off. That scared me. Stepped up. Appalled that misread his bloody things. Maybe it will only ever and ever. And I'll say time you have to tiger on the box. And frosties. Well I was scared. Witless. It's great. It's too bloody late. Tony. I said to you this little opportunity to have a sip of water. So anyway, like what people obviously want is I say like, you know, the solution to this. There were two solutions as they, uh, to submit. There's a subjugation of self self in terms of, you know, because of course self is an amorphous idea, isn't it all.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       So we're talking about the kind of self which is this sort of relentless driven in a narrative that the two ways I have found, because I've had to do this because being serious for a while to snatch your mantle of pompous, pious back backpacks for 10 seconds, I myself have had to battle quite sick because I believe that the disease of addiction has it its core, a kind of circuitous self centerdness that can only be ended well first by the removal of the initial substance that one identifies with, in my case, it was like crack and heroin at the time I got clean. Once those things gone, you recognize those drives are still present. If you, what is it? And it become obsessed with food. You become obsessed with sex, you become obsessed with work and other people's opinion. And in the end, you recognize that the only way to end this, this, the, the torture of self obsession is for ideas that have always been present in spiritual and religious doctrine, service, connection in it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       What was that? In his service, we are free in whose service is perfect freedom and whose service is perfect for self up to something beyond yourself. So beautiful. Even give yourself up is an idiom that implies that there is an output transcendent to trajectory. I mean the other interesting area that, that in this is the modern ideas of love are about satisfying yourself. Whereas the old idea of love, where you live, you, you surrender yourself to someone else and it's thrilling but frightening because you, you, you give yourself up and that kind of love has disappeared. It would come back. Would you say your love for me, it's a little bit like that. You're a bit like a sort of a modern archive. Troubadour making wonderful. I know that hypernormalisation was in some level of dedicated to me, it could have been called hyper Russell brand ization cut. This could actually remember, I love you. So you're quite safe. Me, you have like a school teacher. So I agreed to come babysit, not being pilloried confusing love.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       Go to pitch it. Conflict with the muppet show, Russell, it's already been out last week. So

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       the, I am, look what I want to get from you is this now what you've just said is like someone is going to make headway in the political sphere and you know, and obviously like I assume on some level that would be me. He's got someone that will know how to close that gap between the solipsistic circuitry. If self obsession, you can't this world out here that we're all forced to. Like you can't put the genie back in the bottle, you just can't. The individualism is here to stay. It's, it's, it's part of the future. Um, what, what a politician in the future who's going to change the world will do, is somehow allow people to still feel they're individuals. Yet at the same time will say if you come together, we can actually the world and something

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       extraordinary and, and, and, and it will be thrilling, but it will also be frightening. And take them into that world. No one's managed to do it. The moment what's happened is a lot of the managerial systems have managed to make people feel they're individuals, but manage them. And we've got to transcend that. I mean, I think it may somehow come out to the internet in some way or another because it's a mass communication tool. It can create constituencies globally. They're not defined by geography states and old, but at the moment the technologist, the engineering people who dominated applying an engineering model to an engineering models are about feedback and they say they constantly read you in the past and feed more back to you. It doesn't have to be like that, but it needs. What it needs is a content or a vision of the future.

Speaker 3:          00:48:14       And it hasn't got one at the moment. I'll work it out by the end of the podcast now. Well, there's some of the more prosaic, uh, aspects of a contemporary life. What'd you think of old Trumpkins Pumpkin then? What do you think? Why is this happening? I have a very cynical theory about Donald Trump got one. Well, as us politics became more and more deracinated and what does that mean? Deracinated thinned out the resonated and sort of less and less substantial and less and less able to change things or confidently able to change things and power shifted away to all sorts of other things that we were participating in. Really what people like trump part is, they've become, they're not really politicians, they're pantomime villains. They've turned politics into a Vaudeville. And what will they do is they come on stage and we go, this is outrageous in big capitals.

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       This is absolutely terrible. We packed, we tap away on social media saying this is really, really, really bad. And as I say in the film, uh, a marketeer for online. So every once angry people clickable and clicks are gold dust. And really what those cliques do is feed modern power and everything stays the same. And do you mean feed modern power editor? But if you, if, if you click a lot, yeah, you're actually, that's what social, those who run social media benefit from, you're actually keeping the whole thing churning over everything. There's a lot of power in that world. If you have something like facebook, which in its newsfeeds increasingly gives you what it knows you like and what you you and what and what you hear is what you like. Then that's incredibly powerful because it's actually people's reality because you are shaping what they know and you're shaping a Bible.

Speaker 3:          00:50:05       What you don't know. Now, those who run social media, we'll say this is efficient. They're not. They're not ideologists. They're not saying, we must tell them this, and in fact it's the algorithms that are doing that. Of course they've designed the algorithms, but the algorithms function is to give you more of what it knows you like because that's efficient, but look at what that means. That means that you only know what others like you know, and then there's another group over there who know what they know that the others in their group now and they never meet. I mean, there's a fascinating quote of the day after Brexit from a social media activist who was a remainer. He wanted to remain it, but he wanted to find out what the other lot felt like who were the triumphant that day, and he went onto facebook and he tried to find through the custom feeds, people like that he couldn't do it and he was actually shocked.

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       I won't read you the whole quote, but it's. It's absolutely fascinating. It's a man realizing that there are two halves of the world now, so separated from each other. That one half can't actually actively go and find out what the other half is feeling now. That's called power. Now, I don't think that in facebook there is anyone saying, this is the world we want. They're saying this is efficient, but that, look what that efficiency is. It's a conservative world that holds things stable and implicitly. What that means is that things aren't going to change, and what that means is that those who are in remain making power, so power, power cannot move, cannot move.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       Revolution is about reordering, reorganizing power, distribution of power, redistribution of resources, so a powerful forces for stacy's, however, a anodyne they may present themselves as being, if not benign, then then they are in fact the agents.

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       All the establishment. Yes, and then also in those chambers, anyone in those in your little network or big network who comes along and says something that the others don't like, gets up silently, ejected immediately. The book that that journalist John Ronson wrote about what it's like being shamed on social media is a very good sort of anthropological example of what happens to people within the network who say the wrong thing. It's like being in a village in the medieval times, you're just ejected if you're the wrong person, you're thrown out of the out of town after the city limits, so, so everyone's. Everyone remains, remains thinking the same and that's conservative. We're complicit in it. And what's an everyone? Everyone knows it. They know it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       One of the things that I'm very much interested in, you've said this several times and there's a bit in my standup of like talking about the morning of the cameras election and he gives that speech and it will. The thing that struck me on a personal level actually, because the speech that he gives, the speech that Theresa may gave, like the speech that you often hear politicians give, is kind of utopian. We're, we're going to build a Britain where people are prepared to work and we get the opportunities they need with the most vulnerable members of society are looked after we at what your religion or your race is. You'll be taken care of. We'll be able to case you've Britain where everyone can participate. You think fucking know if that what you were saying, then it was the reality that will be okay, but I know that what you're saying is bullshit and you know that it's bullshit and you know that we know it's bullshit and yet it's perpetuated.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       Now for me, this is the distillation of hypernormalisation is the disjunct. Now this other idea of there being two, a tandem narratives concurrently running takes place, doesn't it? You don't need to consult the external world to get ratification of that, but it has because it happens internally as well on individual levels of any individual's consciousness. That one census, there's the part of the part of me that is married to the fulfillment of my stimulation. There's the part of me that goes, well, that will just happily use this podcast as. Right, okay. Then what is another way that I can assert myself in the public conversation and in public life powerfully? How can I get? Because you know, like I've tried sort of vanilla fame of being sort of Hollywood actor and I've had this sort of like this activism, feynman that weren't quite fulfilling. What's the next version?

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       Proper religious, spiritual devotion. Now that will, that will do it. There is a lot, you know, so these things don't. In a way the stimuli is the same. You know, the object is shifting in Hollywood fame, money, drugs, sex. The object is shifting, but the drive remains the same. Now it's only through like know was only through a kind of a sense of actual detachment, relinquishing and service, but I can alter the kind of, I don't know the modem, I can know I can alter the engine burst or if there is such a thing as an essential self beyond the biochemical drives, beyond the biographical recollections, if there is some self is consciousness is something and not nothing, not some inadvertent byproduct of the working of the mind, the brain rather then then there is surely some value in this info in attaching to. This is quite simple and religious idea.

Speaker 3:          00:54:53       I do think that the one thing that's going to come back onto the table, his religion, because I think the real weakness of the modern systems of managing us as individuals is that it cannot deal with our own mortality because the great. I mean I'm more, what's the word? PROZAC and functional. Then you have Arabic religion, but I do think it's. It's main function in society has been to give people constellation in the face of their own death that the sense that that when they die, something will go on and they will be part of something that's going on. It's really powerful and it's really necessary and that's the in the modern, rational, efficient, utilitarian, technocratic world of managing the individual. It cannot give you any constellation and I think a lot of the pessimism that you find on the left is from that they're actually projecting onto the world. They're saying there's not really as good day everybody's going to die and it becomes this sort of terrible, terrible fear of death, which then colors everything which then stops them being optimistic about changing the world.

Speaker 2:          00:55:56       So That's interesting. And when you said before about fear and loneliness, these, again, these are sort of a. that's an emotional conversation that, that they're kind of a dry creaking arguments of socialism and unable to have now. Like I, I think about this also often remember that socialism came out of religion, especially in this country. I recognize that it was sort of certainly departed from it because, you know, for understandable reasons around dogma and because of the, you know, sort of necessity or lifestyle for the revolutions of a century or so ago meant that, you know, that that kind of state church and state power had to be dressed and harmonized and somewhat knew it. But for me, what that, what is required is a sort of a, um, I used to once again distill and recognize what the function of religion actually is to help us deal with the experience of being a human being that you know, that politics is no longer able to do and no longer aspires to do and which consumers in artfully done for the previous 50 years.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       But it seems to be filtering at this point. And now you're saying that these sorts, of course we're talking about kind of a niche market really aren't because most of the world don't sit around on facebook. Are they not in like Africa or uh, you know, sort of Latin America? Are they, I don't know. I'm not there, but like so, so like you know, what we're discussing is a is a particular phenomena to our kind of cultures, but it seems, but I obviously agree with you and in fact, even when I was somewhat directly involved in the media and political conversation, my, what I felt was this isn't actually all. That's what I've found. I thought I felt like this isn't the conversation I want to after. This is the new shy and Trivia. I'm interested in something that is very direct and very real among and understand a person like what?

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       What can you sort of think that all saints get? Not the band science and although they were bloody good. I'm very true. I loved those sisters reached the point of altruism. Service. Surrender becomes sort of kind of simple and almost indistinguishable from mental illness in it. A lot of cases I'm talking particularly if Francis of Assisi who wouldn't want around your calf, Adam, bringing goats in, ranting and raving, playing the pan pipes on the stairwells, meddling with your cats, putting them all in jumpers and telling you that, that the spirit of Jesus in them. Because let me tell you, that's what he would do. And like so, like, so this hypernormalization I suppose what it's doing is, is we're living in a spectacle and anyway, it's just, it's too, now that the words come up, it's pretty similar to some of that deep boys idea though, that sort of late, uh, late 60 situation is in French situation isn't.

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       I'm saying, hold on a minute. Well, bloody hell is this. It's not real. And then you go, what are you, who are you? What is my role in the world that we have no access to what he's real, but we are living in an impersonation of reality. I've never really got along with all that debord stuff. It's all men in black, black punk music. Talk about that sort of stuff. I think it's more mundane than that is that every, every age creates its own reality. That's what power does. I'm in the functional Paris to tell you a story about the world. Our story wins. Yes. Because what is reality? It's just a jumble of masses of things. Gas, real power is taking the reality and shaping it. And at the moment, I think what you're talking about is also is that we are becoming a bit distrustful of the stories those empower tell us and it's all feeling a bit Janky and falling apart and what we're waiting for

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       is another story that comes in on. What I find it a bit odd is that actually rather than celebrating this moment of sort of transitioned from one big story to another, we're feeling so frightened rather than actually celebrating it as a moment where you can shape anything the way you wanted it to be. I think what's lurking around is not just religion. There are two things sitting around waiting. When is religion, the other science, the thing that no one ever talks about the memory because scientists has got stuck in many ways in dogma, in sort of weird dogma, but also because it's all about serving the individual. These days, scientists spend their time getting grants by doing research that tells us that if you eat this, you'll die. Or if you do this, it have a bad effect on your health. And then next year I'm telling you the opposite about that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       Here's another one that is sort of reductive. It's been reduced to at our imaginations, whereas somewhat science used to do was tell us extraordinary things about the world that hidden things that it could reveal, and this is sort of Austin was waiting there to be rediscovered and I have this instinct that what might happen in answer to the sort of rather strange, utilitarian stuckness of our time is that someone will find a way of fusing scientific ideas, religious ideas to produce a certain, I don't know, a vision of an extraordinary world that somehow has a logical power to it and it will. The science and religion will fuse and it will. What it will offer is a way of us still feeling that we're individuals, but there's another word we can go towards. What do you think would be the role of traditional religions like Islam and in in this changing world?

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       Islam is interesting because it, it, it, it combines an idea of individualism with the sense of community and it's powerful that. I mean it's. But again, in the western world, it's very difficult to discuss his lab at the moment without getting a wave of, of what's the word, fear and disapproval because it's been so demonized. I mean it, I'm not trying to praise Islam or, or, or be rude about it, but it is fascinating religion to look at and I think I gave you a book once which was the history of the world told from the Islamic perspective and when you read it, it just makes you look at the world differently. And that's what we do these days. That's right. Destiny disrupted. It's fantastic book because it makes you pull back and look at the world differently and we just don't do that these days.

Speaker 3:          01:01:50       I suppose people aren't really willing to embrace that kind of mentality or change unless there is some sort of desperation typically. And traditionally people don't like, you know, say like Latin revolutions in sort of a bit off this mic. People are concerned, but my voice isn't as deep and booming dominant as he me. I'm like that, you know, typically revolutions happen when the conditions are correct, when people are galvanized. Norml is an element of desperation, but done. There's always someone who comes along crystallizes it. I mean, I've always been fascinated by the Iranian revolution, how many came along. I mean he and, and he managed to assemble three or four different groups in society and somehow gave them a common identity. He didn't just killed off about two of the other groups. He's going really well and he's got, oh, the few execution is towards the back end of their evolution.

Speaker 3:          01:02:39       A master's right. But got up until then. Well, I mean, what Romania did is he realized that there was a whole massive group of people who'd moved into the cities over the last 10 years in the 19 seventies who were really pissed off and felt completely alone. And he saw that group and he also saw that there was a group of middle class left wing activists and he put the two together because what he did with this lamb is he said, no, we can put it to the size it. He pushed aside Islam, especially sheer Islam, which had always seen itself as quiet. It wasn't going to take an active role in the world and that was its tradition and he did it brilliantly and he then took power and you got rid of the middle class activist. He's just shot them around here. Well, it revolutions are brutal and frightening and this is the thing that one has to go back to.

Speaker 3:          01:03:32       If you want change, if you really want to change the world, you have to tackle power and when you tackle it's quite rough and things will get quite. What's the word iffy and I think the middle class is might find it a bit difficult and I remember once having at a thing with you when we were talking about this, just turning to the audience and saying, well actually really? You talk about revolution. You talk about change. Do you really wanted it? Will change the world massively for you or do you just want the banks to be a little bit nicer? Is that it? I think, and there was complete silence because actually I do think at the moment in the West people genuinely, they're nice, they're good, they really want change, but they want change that isn't really going to disrupt the world and I'm not sure that's really possible if you really want to give a voice and a power and a sense of confidence to all those people outside the city who are feeling lonely and uncertain and living completely.

Speaker 3:          01:04:33       What's the word? Uncertain lives have no sense of their own confidence. Confident Future. You're going to have to change things quite substantially and you're going to have to take on really vested interest. That's going to be quite frightening. You got to be willing to give up everything is it. I think that like the difference between a priest and a prophet, someone explained to me was the, uh, the willingness to live it, the willingness. They were like, yeah, I'll sacrifice everything. And I go back to the civil rights movement in the 19 fifties and America white middle class activists went to the south and they gave up their lives for years to do something that they thought was morally right. And as someone wrote the other day, you cannot imagine that happening now. They'd want to be telling everyone that they're doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Because that's how you get validated these days as an. You want

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       people to know that you're doing it, but you're right. Most of the heroes of the civil rights movement, especially with remained anonymous, of course. Precisely. Now again, what you're talking about is a I vialed spiritual idea because that is about, yes, it is because it's about the transcendence of your individualism that you can't. That you're not going to receive validation from anyone in here who surface. We also politics. Politics is about giving yourself up to some, an idea beyond yourself. So it's religion and it's its, its dominant idea about how you, how you deal with a dynamic world. At the moment, we pretend the load is stable, but it's not going to be. It can't. Now, and in fact it isn't, I mean the fact that I had a wicked quote from derailed our show and it sort of rings incredibly true given the actuality, the cosmic actuality, not just our time, but of all time said, uh, of someone brought up society and he says, society what?

Speaker 2:          01:06:12       The society. It's a clearing in the forest. You know, that this will be reclaimed by nature. We are in infinite space. So your point about order and stability, these things are always temporal. The idea of ongoing stability in limitless chaos when the actual code we are being cradled by absolute chaos is, it's an anathema and it's unsustainable. It is unsustainable. It can't continue, but it will review. But it doesn't mean you can't try and achieve good things. I mean, there are two now. It doesn't mean that there are two types of political ideas have changed. One is that you can actually seize history and Tony or way, which is sort of what Napoleon has tried to do. His great example. The other is, is that you, you, you understand that the world is chaos and you see a moment where you can use the chaos, morally achieve what you want to do.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       And that's the other way of changing the world, that it's about opportunity, but you have to do that. You have to have a picture in your mind or what you are trying to get towards what you think is good and then you adjust as the chaos around you changes. And, but, but, but we do know that we think this is it. These ideologies are all. I have to be sort of pretty reactive in a sense though, Adam, because otherwise, how do you fashion them? Even if you talk about one of the most, sort of a radical, murderous, but sort of a vivid narratives to emerge like knit sort of 20th century fascism is like, that was a response to economic and political conditions. You can't just out of nowhere go, let's do this thing. The land is alive. We are a folk and that's where it's frightening change. I mean that was a response to chaos in the 19 twenties. Um, and, and, and remember that they were socialists to begin with finances. Yeah, national socialists and they had seen the chaos at the market in America and in Europe and they reacted against it and said, no, we are going to organize this and we are going to go towards this. And it's very dangerous. I mean, the other argument is that all rhetoric about revolution

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       at the moment is just rhetoric because the experience of our generation of our time is a century of revolutions that went badly wrong. Yeah. And the last thing we want is one or more of them. And then actually what we were creating in reaction is a very conservative moment, a counterrevolutionary moment. That's what we're living through. And it may go on for quite a long time. And all arguments about revolutionary change are just like quarterly behavior. We do it, but we don't really expect it's ever going to happen. This is a cynical view, but maybe that's how history works. You go through a period of intense revolution which does change the world and then you have a counter revolution which which is actually born out of the the, the, the social classes that came out of those revolutions that failed, but it led to a new class breaking through and now they want everything to be stapled and that the argument about what people like Mrs Thatcher and President Reagan we're about is that a new lower middle class which we're confident rose up in the 19 seventies and wanted its place in society and they let me read.

Speaker 3:          01:09:22       Thatcher and Reagan left that class through economically new labor, let it through culturally and socially and gave it confidence and now he wants everything to stop and be stable and the systems of management that we have got him placed. I'm talking about keeping everything stable are a reflection of that class, that path, new classes, desire for stability and we may be in this for the longterm longterm,

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       but of course again, these things, these are quite isolated interests like on a global level, aren't they adam? I mean, or do you like. Because when I'm. When you take something that I think ultimately there has to be a resource, like any management of power, the resource has to be sort of the feelings of the people, you know, and of course people can be manipulated, directed, encouraged. There's all sorts of things that can happen to, you know, but we'll look at the way we consume, look at the things we do, the places we go, what we were. Obviously people's desires can be management related and moved around the question. But like when you're talking about when you sort of, um, when he becomes quite defined and specific is it just did. When you talk about like, you know, like sort of a, a generation of people going through batteries and then sort of is in or whatever we would call it. And now that makes sense to me as a narrative. It makes perfect sense. But again, we're talking like to wield such incredible influence. We're talking about a very small phenomenon, aren't we? We're talking about sort of a class of people in Western Europe.

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       You're living in America where we're living in our bubble, in history and in geography. There are all sorts of other, I mean the sad thing about our time is there are all sorts of other things happening outside our bubble, but because we're so scared of change and we're scared of looking outside and we're scared of the future, we don't really see them. I always think the thing about our time, which is sad, is that we're a bit like, you know when things go wrong in an airplane or you're encouraged to adopt what they call the brace position, where you hunker down, you're too frightened. Jakarta window because you can see the wind going up and down like that. That's where we are at the moment. We're, we're refusing to look outside and see another. I do all my plain Jane is embrace position since I've got on before they bring the food. Braise, braise, Mr. it was still brochure.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       Yeah. We're embrace position at um, we're looking at your phone. Say, look him. I've never known anyone so keen to manage and keep things stable. Then Adam. Curtis, it's bloody you. Every time a little bit of chaos comes from the underneath, from the upside down, from the other world, from the Nether region, from the other place, from the shadow lands. You look down at your smartphone so vehemently and aggressively. Not Enough, having met. Don't like Lord Palmerston. Do you know much about no pack course? Are these appropriate? A stove pipe pattern?

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       Oh No.

Speaker 2:          01:12:10       Lord Palmerston, a biography by Russell brand based on noise and one fact, fact bearing his name. I don't even know if he was. Which part he was in liberals, conservatives. I don't even remember the names of Adam. Thank you for coming in in here. Pleasure. You know I love you very much. I do know that. I wonder where you fit into all this in your emotional life. You are happier this some things manifesting itself. I don't think it's just pure narcissism, but even if it is, it's very powerful. Too Real. I wonder what's happening for you in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:12:50       I was being serious that you. You are a sort of the persona you have created as a comedian is the arch narcissistic or age you. You play on that and you, but you are self conscious about it and in that sense you are, what's the word and example of modern social realism because everyone lives in their heads these days. Like you said, they just do. They don't live outside and most modern novels or or the internal monologue anyway, you're an exponent's your you, you, you, you demonstrate that in three dimensional space. You, you're very good at doing the, bringing out the consciousness, the way people live in their heads all the time and you express it in a big, what you would call comedic way. Well, it is objective. Really. Comedy is a discipline. It's an art form. You don't have to call it what you would call and what you're keeping bumping up against is what lies beyond that. Yeah, and is it religion or is that it? Oh, it is

Speaker 2:          01:13:52       these religion in the sense of like that I in spite of being on a course of religion and global politics where they tell me, this is not the definition, but I believe that religion is where we interface with the divine. We're like, this is where the thing. I think I said this to you on the phone the other day, I said, ultimately our capacity to understand information will run out. We're there is a limit to our

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       ability to understand information that the information will not run out. So at some point faith, but isn't that what religion is it a sense about? It's about the acknowledgement of everything we don't know and a story that is based on face trying to make sense of what we don't know. That's right. I've always thought that's what religion was about. Well apparently plus constellation in the face of not knowing everything will. It'd be nice. I'd like. So I think humility might be really good for our society in the future and maybe we've reached the limits of that individualism, but maybe we haven't. Maybe this is it because we think of trump as a sort of like a sort of a gargoyle decoration on the priapic thrusting hard on, have an invalid journalistic and you could look, you could look at trump as the fag end of that sort of individualism that started back in the seventies.

Speaker 3:          01:15:01       It means Fagen. English American isn't. Yes, I mean this. Yeah. The decade end of that, that the sort of the counterculture sitting around in the 19 seventies going politics is shit, man, is it ends up with trump sort of amazing, you know, and I can see he has as many roots in the punk movement as he does in, in the libertarian, right wing of the sentences. And he somehow a PR moment where all those currents have come together and are showing how to cade they've become. Which means again, we're waiting for something else. Yeah, I agree. Well, it's time for something else. So I've been listening to the Russell brand forecast with the Great Adam. Curtis' hypernormalisation is available and BBCI player, if you're American, you can probably get it on youtube by now. You Slippery Hill and the British licensed payer paid for that and what did you do? He threw out tea into the harbor in Boston. Will enjoy their film. Not on nod pendant. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       That was russell brand under the skin. I hope you enjoyed listening to me interviewing Adam. Cut and now an advert for. What would you like? Well, dot tonight basket. Get yourself a biscuit biscuits available down at the shops there. Which ones you're going to get that? Well that's up to you, but do get yourself a nice biscuit.
