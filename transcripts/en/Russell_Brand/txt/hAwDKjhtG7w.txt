Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Sophie scott is a British neuroscientist and senior fellow at University College London, research in the neuroscience of voices, speech and laughter. She's known for our public engagement work, including performing standup comedy and was featured in BBC radio four program, the life scientific. Her research investigates the neural basis for vocal communication, how our brains process the information, speech and voices, and how our brains control the production of our voice. It's made me really self conscious of my voice that has now sophie professor. Thank you, Professor Sophie. Sophie, professor, thank you for professor coming here and doing this interview with me. I'm very grateful. Thank you very much for inviting me. I saw you on Jimmy Carr. I'm a fan and indeed friend of Jimmy's and he'd done a horizon where he talked about the neuro, the neurology of laughter. Can you just summarize what you're doing on that show because it will help me to do a show with you now.

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       Uh, they came to me because I'm one of the few people researching laughter in the UK. If you go onto, um, the major database of science papers and you do a search on emotion expression of fear, you get back over 4,000 published papers on fear and if you do a search on emotion expression, laughter, you get back 150 papers there, just no papers in it, did no research going on into it. And so I was lucky that meant that they will know what else they could ask about how, you know, how and why we laugh. Um, and that's something I've been looking. I've been looking at it from a perspective of how, how we communicate with each other. And I got interested in positive emotions in communication. And as soon as you start doing that, you find that laughter is just weird. It's everywhere. It's continuously founding conversation. People did much, much more than they think they do. And we coordinate it really nicely in conversation. And interestingly, if you ask people about laughter, those what makes you love when you love, they'll talk about jokes and comedy and humor, but actually out in the wild, most laughter is just happening in conversations and people aren't laughing at jokes. Let me do laugh at jokes and comedy. People are laughing to show that they know each other and like each other and understand each other.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Oh, you mean the social wild ocelot humans, monkey, human, primate people. Exactly. So like, yeah, I do notice that. I listened now for that sound. And one of the aspects of laughter, humor, comedy and communication I'm interested in is the political discourse. John cleese has it. Brilliant thing. I wonder if you're aware about a serious and solemnity seriousness and solemnity. He said like, people prohibit the use of humor in particular areas of the public sphere because of its potency and its ability to disrupt. And I've always found it interesting that with the emergence of political figures like Nigel Farrage, Boris Johnson and date Donald Trump, people that are sort of used a different type of rhetoric, uh, kind of accessibility and a kind of humor. But of course, humor has always been a part of the political discourse, if you know, they, they make jokes all the time in parliament and in Congress. They use humor to make people like them. And I always think the, um, some of the idioms around comedy or interesting make people laugh is a form of control. What have you got to add to that bloating?

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       Well, no, I think you're right. It's an incredibly nuanced behavior in adulthood and it, it's interesting to think about its roots because its roots lie in play and play behavior. That's what happened when baby's first laugh. When the parents take a little more picky with people, you could move with them and that all came out wrong. Play peekaboo with them. Then that's a, it's a response to a playfulness. There's no joke there. There's no bigger structure. It's a, you know, I understand you're engaging with me in this fun way. And it's absolutely basic to pro or primates. Mammals. It's a map that's a mammal behavior play. We understand that there are strata of behavior. So there's one by via, wherever you. If I said I'm very offended by what you've just said on this podcast, you would go, you would recognize that as, oh my God, this is serious.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       And then if I thought really, you're absolutely gorgeous, then there's sort of a sense of relief. Yeah. So lack of. It's the acknowledgement that there are frequencies you saying and these frequencies are vocally expressed, but they're real logically understood. Another demonstrable. Is it like something that's happening in play that neurologically that is not present in serious in the communication? That's a good question. And I don't know. I don't know if I can give you an equally good answer. We know that, um, play is incredibly important to mammals as they're developing all mammals play. And even if you grow up to be a completely a Social Predator mammal, then you will see that would be like a tiger, a, yeah, an old big cats. Um, or even now I'm going to explain this really badly paid. Even if you'll grow up to be a very frightening mammal.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       It never plays a, um, well it big cats. I'm auteurs and that's not true. What I'm doing this very badly. Gorgeous. Now please tell us what is it? Good. What is a good a printer that's not playful. What about that gorgeous gorilla with night eyes? I saw her on Gogglebox. Well, gorillas are a good example of they're not predators. They're vegetarians, but they are. They continue to play throughout their lifetime like humans do. Like artists do, like dogs do. Most mammals play in juvenile period and that's when they're learning. We've got these massive brains. We have this extended period of being juveniles when we're training those big brains up and this is all mammals and we we learned mostly play, not entirely, but that's one of the structures and then in adulthood most mammals stop and a handful carry on like our dogs auteurs other primates doing this playful behavior and what you find is that a behavior like laughter starts having a relatively simple role.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       It's social bonding, it's playfulness, and then as we get older it becomes more and more complex tool. By the time you were an adult and you're hearing laughter, it's almost like a hall of mirrors of interpretation. Somebody. It could be laughing because there helplessly laughing. There could be laughing because they're embarrassed because they're frightened because they're trying to cover up being angry because they trying to make somebody like them because they're in pain. Studied all these different reasons why laughter starts to appear around you and when you're in an interaction with somebody, you're normally pretty good, normally pretty good at reading that. It's often when you're inhale, after going on, it's part of something that has maybe nothing to do that. Okay, what's. What are they laughing? Listen to them laughing and it seems those pigs, they didn't even pigs. What do they love? What's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       Well, actually even worse, you think they're laughing at you. You know, because that's another thing. Am I included in this lover and my explanation? The love. So it's, it's. You're always thinking about it. It's always meaningful. Even if it's got apparently nothing to do with you, you will pay some attention to laughter and try and work out what's going on because it is such a meaningful behavior. It's interesting that laughter is vocal but nonverbal. That is sort of a sort of super linguistic is beyond language life, it's what you look to to communicate in situations where language isn't of use to you to try to connect to people for it after. Absolutely, and in this it sits with a set of things called non verbal emotional expressions which are more like animal calls and they are like speech. So when I'm talking to you now I'm doing something no other no other animal can do in nature I you, we are.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       When we talk to each other, produce this incredible sound that starts down at a rib cage and we're making sounds at our voice box of them is shaped that with our tongue and our lips and our jaw and that's. This gives us this sound literally unparalleled in nature and then when we are in a really pretty extreme emotional state, we don't bother with that at all and we just squeeze the air out and we make screams and grunts and sounds all laughter and they're really much more basic sounds. I listen now sometimes when I'm talking to people to hear the sort of noises they make. There aren't words like a sentence paragraph, what are you doing? Just up to there when he made that little grown. It's weird, isn't it? It is odd and I know we signaling, signaling, glean availability, power status, what's going on, professor? There's that. There's a rather unfortunately named term called back channeling, which means, Oh yes, I know it fairly well. I'm afraid. I began back channeling on my 17th birthday, never called again.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       What it means is people show that their listing, so they tend to make little noises they might make loves, but they also make all sorts of noises just like I'm here and I'm engaged with you. He's like, icontact. I'm using it to indicate that I'm listening. I might also use it to indicate I'm ready to speak to. Also, you know, we, we don't sit and receive messages and then start emitting them at somebody else. We we speak to be understood and we listened to show that we're following and that's making funny noises can be part of that. It's extraordinary what's happening beyond the understood signifiers within language. Is it, you know, whenever you hear that thing of like, oh, 90 percent of communication is nonverbal, how can it be if someone's doing a speech for a guy and we're going to be raising taxes by this amount.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       You're not freaking my attempt. Like those eyebrows you have. So thinking the information, what's going across, isn't it? It definitely is, but it's, it's interesting that as soon as you have a person talking to you, there is never just the words. There's always a voice. Yes. And you do get a lot of other information from that voice. Um, I was thinking about this this morning. I was listening to the, the sex pistols and that, you know, God save the Queen and that came out. Everyone's like, Oh God, this is so shocking. And they keep going, oh no, we love the queen. And I don't think they might.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       Yeah, that's a loaded voice. Exactly. And that I was just, you know, pre pubescent at that time it seemed incredibly threatening because they definitely pretty certainly don't have the queen at all. And it was all coming from how it's phrased and how it's being used in all the sound that's contributing to the noise that they're making. So I came into this area working on speech. I thought I worked on language. That was what I would tell people. I did languages well eat. But even even that was made when I was started scanning brains and you could find all these brain areas that we're responding to, uh, the words that you understand and all the linguistic stuff there. But you also got all these other brain areas that don't care at all about words, but they absolutely care about someone saying it. And of course they're always there if there's someone speaking, there's a voice. And as soon as there's a voice, as another channel of information that you are processing really strongly and the brain cares at least as much about that as it does about the words in terms of activation.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       Because if I think about this, if you were to suddenly be turned into an austere mail from like sort of the Ukraine, who was just saying the exact same content to me in this world, Russell, of course love to bond. I think having a totally different experience. Of course there's all sorts of physical and aesthetic data, but that, that what is contained in the voice is communicating in a powerful way. So the reason that I didn't understand, oh, 90 percent of information is nonverbal. It's because I'm precisely unaware of the way I'm being affected by sound because we don't know how to categorize it. I mean it's language is about what's being said. It's about distinction. I'm saying this and not this and it's easy to categorize and understand less easy, I suppose, as these aspects of communication that are non not vocabulary.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       You're super linguistic. Absolutely. They don't directly influence what your. The words necessarily that you're saying all the can interact with it, but as soon as you, soon as you hear a voice, you've got a person, you've got a good idea at agenda, you've got a good shot is an age, socioeconomic status, geographical origins, mood health. That's very empowering and it's also aspirational. People talk in a way that they want people to see them as like when I've been on the phone to my mum, I taught like my mum for about half an hour afterwards and you know, loved my mom, didn't really want to sound like it, but I'm showing all this stuff about our relationship. As soon as I started talking to her and all of us do that all the time. I'm talking differently to you now because I'm trying

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       to project a particular. What is it? World? I'm hoping it's competent scientists. I'm hoping I'm probably landing on it so much more. Sophie Scott and so much more, um, what we're projecting onto the world and the way that we want to be received and he's sort of laughter somehow a supplement to that or a disruption to that. I think it's, it can be both, so a lot of the time it's something that you're actively using to try and effect interaction. So here's an example. I was on the cheap last week and not particularly full tube coming away from Heathrow and there was a suitcase with no one anywhere near and I suddenly realized I was unattended suitcase so and there were empty seats by it. So the, how many happy, you know, they all know I'm gonna have to say something so. Okay. Right. Excuse me, Dan, you know, everyone, people I'm with going, oh, she's going to say, excuse me, is this anybody suitcase?

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       And there's one right at the other end of the character goes, Oh yes, it's mine. And she came there and I was, she was saying, oh sorry, I didn't realize that become available. And I was going, oh, don't worry. We were both laughing to kind of go, this is okay, so I'm not telling you off. No one's crossed with you. It's all right here. Signaling to each other. This is cool. This is absolutely. We all have the external reference that an unattended bag could mean death and it's in that context. I mean I have seen people get really told off or unattended luggage so you know, we're both trying to make it clear we're not doing that and she's also very sorry, but in fact that is a really nuanced use of laughter that people that that was not helpless. Laughter. I was not in any sense of mused entirely to try and make it better, less threatening.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       It was an expression of a kind of relief. Of course, right? They're sort of like, because there's the process. Of course, if you go now this isn't a terrorist attack on the tube, but also that your social interaction has not failed. It has not been misinterpreted that you've successfully communicated, Oh, I'm another concerned person. Yeah, we're all good here. And if people, if that goes wrong, of course love to can suddenly be really inappropriate and you do encounter situations where people will be like, what? You think? This is a joke. You're laughing at me. I hate that. Like in Goodfellas or it's an awful moment. It's that. It makes your blood run cold. It does happen quite a lot. That's basically a continuum in my life ever suffered. Let the rhythm section of my life is people going, what? You're trying to be funny mate.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       What's that then? And it's awful. It's interesting that it actually in the rhetoric of a violent conflict and we try them and expert like the sort of like what you're trying to be funny. Do you think you're funny that that's sort of like a bit of language that comes up a lot, isn't it? Yep. Because it's undercutting, I suppose. Of course humor is disrupting their. Say there's a standard frequency of like the Banal exchange of information with whatever independent personal inflections you have as your default. Then humor is subverting that. Oh right. I'm in here too. Good to introduce some sort of jackets, spikes all of this. And then another person for power can go, no, this isn't funny, or I don't like that feeling at all. I've made myself nervous just talking about it. Quite a lot of the behaviors that we do. Um, light, laughter and yawning, blinking, contagious.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Most of the blinks you do, you don't need to do your blinks. Blinks were blinking our lives away. Pointlessly thing. If you watch a baby, they don't. They don't do this because we should. We learn contagious behaviors. We learn to pick them up from people and laughed is a really big one to watch my baby. I do watch her. She don't blink very much. He's actually bloody exhausting. She won't have any blinking, but with laughter with the baby, I noticed that. Well, yeah. Well if I got turned around like that and stuff, she loves all that. Yeah. She loves sort of monster play and biting and all that. Not Hard. Not they're not aggressive, but it seems like that there is a function and it's. And when I think about what is my impetus to initiate that behavior, is it recognizing she doesn't yet have language, but I want to feel bonded to her and I want to feel closeness to her and I want to touch her and staff so that place seven, the function of a, of reiterating and compounding our connection.

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       Absolutely. Isn't this very interesting. It is quite striking that we laughed so early. You know, we, we can cry pretty soon as soon as we're born. You know, humans are born about three months too soon because of our massive heads and then around the time we would be born we start laughing, so probably it should have been there right from the outset and then ages later we start making other sounds and it's very interesting that the second thing that comes in is this incredibly potent positive vocalization because babies don't catch laughs from adults, but the adults love when the babies love and you start teaching them about it starts becoming an interaction and there's very nice evidence that well before babies are linguistic in any sense that they can speak at all. They're probably understanding a lot, but they can't do anything vocal. They will pay attention to. Their parents laughed and they will start doing things to make their parents laugh. Precisely because of this communicative linkedin is giving in this interaction that it gives you so long before you're having conversations. Babies are using laughter as actively as you're using love to now to, to drive interactions with you

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       more efficiently. In the case of my baby and me, she's a very funny trial. So like what I'm thinking then is that there is power in laughter, there is power in laughter as a form of communication and barefoot comedy. There is power in it. So like I wanted to. One of the things we've done some pre production here and that's very rare for us. We've got a like examples of politicians using humor and uh, I wonder if we can analyze this is part of our podcast because we are professionals now. Cenk or you'll have to make sure that we can hear it. Maybe you can play into that mic. What Mike is that, that you're on Mike, for what? That, what's that one? Gower. Does that make it go on? You want to play in there? But will we actually able to hear that in the room?

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       I wonder even growing. They're just. So the first one is the first person that's using humor is just sort of a comedy staple of the British political world. It's Boris Johnson using humans to communicate 14 to try and bikes to Holland boomerangs to Australia sands exports of, but we do still export wine to Italy and I'm delighted to say Nigel farage to America now. Boris Johnson, I think is a really good example because I think he's one of the things that human does. Izzy, I think signals and awareness of another seam of communication. Like if you're like, if you're using comedy, you're sort of saying like, I know that on one level we're having this discourse like eat there. Boris Johnson is given a speech in some sort of context like business and economics species to the next selling sand to the Arabs, which is a racist trope actually, but he found a way of have taken out the most obvious racism and making a dog whistle racism.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       One of his great skills actually Boris Johnson and uh, but it's like he's being deliberately humorous. What do you think Boris Johnson is doing there? If I'm absolutely honest, I think Boris Johnson is very carefully cultivated a kind of clownish persona to cover up a tremendously powerfully interested in success politician. He's there was a very interesting essay by Jonathan Coe pointing out that Doris Johnson didn't used to be funny. He used to be just the Pashto in the nineties. It was this, here's this, here's this, another privileged individual from Eaton. And he was on, have I got news for, you know, I remember that. And the first time he was on, um, in his lap, kept having a go at him about a phone call he'd had with the journalists could turn to someone called diaries. Gfi was trying to get the details out of Johnson and Johnson doesn't get mad with very well and his just would not come by way from.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       It kept coming back to Katelyn back to. And in the end I think Paul Martin [inaudible] you got a bit bored, made a joke about it and that was funny and the audience laughed and it somehow simultaneously got Boris Johnson off the hook and somehow the laughter stuck to him not to pull them out. And He'd actually made the joke that was like Batman when Batman was in that cave of bat and became Batman. I'm funny, man, if I'm funny, I don't ever have to reveal my mackie eventually in self interest and a huge political ambitions. I can just laugh my way to the top or at least to the middle and that certainly what Jonathan Co makes quite a good argument for that which I think contains a lot of weight and it certainly needs. It points out that the laughter kind of surrounding Boris Johnson, he understands very well.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       He knows it's not a sign that people are thinking deeply about his intentions kind of. It becomes easy to teach them as a joke and then he can use to a certain extent and it's a double edge sword, but you are licensed to do different things. If people treat you as funny and that works for you and it can work against you and he's been very good at making it work for him. He really has because they're so things like, you know, those allegations about his private life that blokey sort of lost his way out of sort of lots of contentious decisions made while mayor fancy sort of like he's reverse or this brexit stuff and now he's repositioning as sort of an attack dog for the conservatives in this election with that. So if I noticed, he said that he's got beautiful. I mean he's obviously incredibly intelligent man, brilliantly inexpensively educated man and when he sort of contrived an insult like mutton headed mug one lot, I think that's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       Bit of language is a really, really good attack. And like all good comedies, it's got a sort of a specific revelation and a specific intent is a cervic and lacerating piece of language that. And, and I, I feel that when he's doing that stuff that there's a great power in it. Like, you know, I don't think we've seen the summit of Boris Johnson's Korea and luck on what's happening across the water is an indication that there's this type of charm and charisma is a useful way of attaining power. Django, can we put up an American one now just for the purposes of keeping some balance and I'll put that mic up again. So this is what this is this Donald Trump being funny. Obama or trump or Obama? He was. Well funny. He's good because he's charismatic as all hell. He's good looking.

Speaker 3:          00:21:41       I liked Bernie. Bernie's and guy. Apparently some folks really want to say a pot smoking socialist in the White House. We could get a third Obama term after it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       So Nice. Nice little joke there. I mean that. That's how. I mean that's a scripted joke. Obviously. It's a very sort of clear where it's going. Once he says pot smoking socialist, it's playing on his own, sort of like public awareness. So I think Barack Barack Obama's isn't an excellent politician and he states mentally and humorous in a way that doesn't diminish the state is I would say Boris Johnson. He sort of pays a kind of an ethical price, vichy mode that's just more perhaps more to do political stance.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       I think sometimes, and I, I'm, I could be being unfair here, but the Nigel Farrage joke though was basically a not funny, not funny, not funny, isn't funny. You know, we've, we've, you know, people love audience. Laughter is highly sophisticated. I don't need to tell you this, but people will laugh. People laughing as they do in conversations to show that they approve or they agree or they understand or they remember or they've noticed something, you know, as much as it is to do with the movement, and I'm definitely not saying it's not amusement, but the knowledge of project was a kind of like a here is that in in the same way people up until recently used to produce it and there's Donald Trump in itself is a punchline and larger. Just a punchline. Whereas the Obama joke and I fully accepted may well have been written for him, his self depreciating and slightly more complex in terms of the structure of a joke.

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       It's not just a, here's a funny thing. Will laugh at that. I may be biased by as we all are, when we're appraising humor about personal feelings here and that's it, but I'm interested in Obama because in a vocally he just, he's, he's articulate and he used his rhetoric beautifully. He's a beautiful speaker and he's April of capable of dropping into humor at the right time, in the right way, in a way that it's done well. So he kind of excels in how it uses his voice and he's made humor. Part of that. Although one of the things, the things

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       he was also doing in that drug and this not stupid perhaps to do with your area of or certainly not mine, but like he's also diminishing the seriousness of Bernie Sanders, which I imagine the point that you made the point that I don't know when that speech was happening, but clearly it was the point when they were undetermined on who would be the candidate. Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. And it's interesting that sanders is at that point used as the punchline of a joke. So like, I think that I'm very interested in the relationship between comedy and power and I'm very interested as someone who's been ridiculed for entering the public political sphere out of a comedic background. How actually in reality the people in power often used comedy and humor to get what they want and to create the kind of impressions that they want. Should we have a listen to Nigel farrage being funny now because he's, he's another politician that sort of, I think, you know, like you can't sort of whether or not you agree with people's politics, is there the power of their tree and that their ability to have an impact. Is that something that sort of, you know, even in humor is something that we have to take seriously and then we've got the prime minister

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       or should I call him in this context? Piggy in the middle. Oh, that's a good joke.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       Now obviously that's a joke that he's doing that when David Cameron, as we know that the former prime minister put his genitals into a pig's mouth. That's just the prime minister of a country putting his genitals in the mouth of a dead pig there. Um, so like, um, like, ah, for Raj, I think he's an interesting case because one of the things that humans being used for in all of these cases is, I'm like, you, we're like one another. I'm not on the other side of some chasm of puppeteering you and using power. Yeah. There's a, there's a sort of, some element of sharing their people won't. If people don't agree with you or don't like you, they won't laugh, you know? It's um, yeah, I hate that that's happened to me before and it's, it's certainly, uh, you know, I can think of comedians obviously, not you, but I can think of comedians that I would never see something about them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       I don't like them and I'm, I can't imagine what they'd have to do to make me laugh. Now that's just me making it place. Literally, literally nothing to do with them entirely to do with my biases, but it will affect my behavior around them. So I can appreciate, you know, with frauds, I can recognize the structure of that joke and how well it's gone down, but I'm still not smiling because, you know, again, like voices. It's about who I want to be. I don't want to be part of that human. I don't want to be sharing that. But you're right, there's a strong element of sharing and agreement. Yes. That's how it's being used. I mean, because even the word communicator means creator of community creating allegiances. You're communicating. We're not one. We are many that are bonded and I see Alan Moore that are graphic artists saying that, you know, they use like spelling, but we spell that there's a magic in words.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       You can create feelings in another person through what you say. I think that this is a powerful and appealing idea to me. Um, and at this time I suppose it's sort of a pact. Is it a postmodern phenomena? I know I'm not qualified to say, but we're sort of seeing an emergence of a different type of politician and that its apex I think is Donald Trump. And I'd like to talk about him and his use of humor and his ability to communicate because this is a thing that is sort of difficult to say, but I'll ask anyway. So I'm, I kind of like, I mean, he's personally attacked me, like, you know, like literally I've got, we use it in my standup show, rebirth. There's like huge. Like there's a bit of him guard Russell Brand Byron Idiot. I really like naming me and attacking me. But before he was president actually.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       But that's, you know. But um, it's kind of what I like about Donald trump is a sentence that's not easy to finish, is that he's kind of, he's kind of certainty. And like there's something I think quite likable sort of shrugging. He always seems like he's shrugging off and I find it sort of interesting when things are so, so because I suppose my particular take on politics is that there's a lot of concealment, a lack of transparency. Someone like Donald Trump, I sort of think, well, there's a plainness of bovine obviousness. I'm rather enjoying that things are being revealed that shouldn't be. And things are being concealed. That shouldn't be like the top of his head. There's, have a, let's have a listen to. Um, I just have a listen to Donald Trump saying saying, you've got it there. Django Hillary

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, pardon me, this is the first time ever, ever that Hillary is sitting down and speaking to major corporate leaders and not getting paid for it. The media is even more bias this year than ever before. However, Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it. It's fantastic. They think she's absolutely great. My wife, Melania gives the exact same.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       That's actually a good job. That's the best joke because he's the victim of it. That is so self effacing. I mean, NASA. Gosh, that's dangerous. Now this has been an argument like the second one was obviously in front of Hillary Clinton. He criticized there again accurately. And you can say, of course, like, you know, communicative skills become more important in a time when there's a lack of trust. Uh, talking about people generally speaking, feel like the politics doesn't serve them, that democracy doesn't serve them. If someone turns up that's kind of applicable or appealing in a way that's surprising. Hey, so it has a particular impact. What was there? What did you think about that? He's certainly has. He has quite a strange voice because he doesn't do a lot of the things that people kind of get pushed towards in a liquor. Certainly for British and I know that has to be a provider that obviously I don't understand American accents in the same way, but it doesn't sound communication.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       It doesn't sound like he's given them any insight into perhaps don't do that strange high pitched thing when you're going for a job, but you know he's because he's got a high pitched voice and he sounded, you know, it's not. It's a bit nicer with there some restriction going on in there and it's kind of, I can't do it, but they're there. It's got a quite a, quite a limited range of 30. He doesn't. What does that mean? The music of your voice and we go in and out of fashion is unlocking that. If you remember back to when Neil Kinnock did that amazing speech about militant and the grotesque chaos will leave. It comes a little lever counseling. It's just a beautiful piece of music. It's just, it's an amazing speech, but the, the, the, the music of his voice is absolutely extraordinary. Is furious, absolutely furious.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       And that's gone largely out of fashion. You don't find in u k political rhetoric that that kind of use and the voice in that way because it sounds hysterical. I bet it doesn't sound managed or managerial bureaucratically. Like one of the things that came in with Tony Blair and actually Debbie Cameron fully did this as well, was that kind of like, well, we're just having a chat sort of quality. I'm talking to you now. This is because you can trust me. It is new labor. Look, I'm just actually just saying stuff like. Yeah, I know what you mean. There was sort of, it was my friend Adam Curtis says that it was like, you know, like sort of Clinton and Blair was heralding of a sort of a managerial type of politics. We're just managers. What we are, we like middle managers at work. You don't. We're not sort of powerful demagogues.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       We're not sort of people that are would like them. It's not like an outfit that punching above his weight there from the podium fishing the skies and roaring like as people just meekly giving you data and quite an affable way now like Tony Blair continues to grow ever more presidential while damning his own party. But at that point it was like there was a kind of an unaccessible ordinariness to him. Exactly. And and it was obviously it's conveyed in many ways, but it was really big part of how he spoke. I'm aware that there's that phrase isn't there to, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail and I bring everything down to voices except there's other stuff going on. But in that, in that context you can even sort of seeing Obama was returning, it had elements of a more kind of a classical rhetoric in his style and the way he uses voice and your point to make here.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       I imagine that he was afforded a different kind of exoticism because the narrative that is present presidency was African American and there's always an American politics. The idea that that is an inclusion from outside of the mainstream. Using that to inflate the idea that the popular mainstream is ethical look after all, we've got an African American president and I suppose as if he had a different type of vocal license. I don't know about different kinds of political license because there are sort of different constraints. We're talking about a particular issue, but it's interesting that you had more. What was that word again? Oh, he's just got a bit rhetorical. President used the music of his voice quite a lot, but I suppose it was also

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       interesting. I'm Deborah Cameron's done some work on this woman from Oxford University professor at Oxford University and she's described. Have you looked at. Come on. If you look at a gang culture and you get a very particular linguistic use for them, gangs, people use that to mark their membership. If you look at female members of gangs in the US, they will very often be the most kind of like classic users of the slang because there might be other stuff they can't get involved in, but they can get the words right and it's marking your, I deserve to be here because I'm doing this right. And maybe if Obama had been less formal in his speech, people would be more like, oh, well I'll just can't do this at all. You know, um, you know, it was marking I deserve to be here and I can damn well you into this was perhaps held to a higher standard.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       But you're saying they're very, my voice now. It's killing me as you can hear what you're saying. Like Donald Trump sounds a little bit strangulated and sort of, I mean his voice. In fact, sap, like he very much positioned himself as I'm going into. I'm draining the swamp. Every said I'm going to go there. I'm going to mix stuff up. And he, even on a vocal quality like the voice is interesting isn't because the voice in some ways is a ghost in the machine, is the vibration of the vocal cords. It isn't actually there at all. Your Voice, your inhabited by this thing. So isn't there something essential about voice? This is part of your, excuse me, essence who you are or vocalist who you are at your core or your soul or something. It is. There's a real truthiness devices. Um, if I, when I got here, I was nervous and I was aware when I was supposed picking to jen and when I first met you, I could hear the tension in my voice because it absolutely you can't get with very hard to get past it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       It must be crippling to know that much about vocal communication and then to still be subject to rules that are beyond that kind of regulation. And I'll know what the hell is this adrenaline doing? Some of vocal folds. But it's um, and, and that's just true. So if you are in an emotional state, it affects your body and your voice is being made by your body. It sounds stupid, but if I don't use my voice, you won't know anything about what I sound like. I have to do something. It's an action as much as it is language, the voice. So it's uh, it's, you can get information from my facebook photo. If I was asleep, I was dead. My face doesn't need to do things for you to take a picture of you when you're dead. This has gone very much. I'll be in touch with the coroner was really silent witness, but you, you, you, you have to do something for a voice to be there. And that's why it is. You say it's this weird ephemeral thing and it's very, so much and it's so. And it can be an incredibly strong tell to your emotional state and while it can be very hard to work around so because it was what it can, what it can do to your body. It's revealing. So the more sort of masking techniques and manipulative techniques that you can get into it, the better, but I suppose the, all of the, in a way that is hard to hold up an absolute standard because

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       like in other areas, Barack Bama is being judged in a different way to Donald Trump. Nigel farrage, he's being charged in a different way. It's, it's reasonable to make Theresa May, I think, a bloody horrible voice. Three to my haven't being funny, but there's no sort of gargly, Strangley, post-coital sort of warble oh, there's something in there. I don't like much. What is it? I think um, it's very immediate. It's very hard to judge voices outside of everything else you know about somebody so that, that's, that's a difficult part. What you're saying isn't evil voice. He's got that kind of cracked bell quality. Like there's a. I feel like she's striving to do something with a voice that she's not quite landing on and that's not. But she's having them lessons. You know, when people get really famous that they go, you're going to stop talking about that mate, your prime minister now.

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       It's really interesting. I'm listening to Margaret Thatcher now because she was told, expressly told you, speak to women, speak with pitch to two eyes, speak lower men with men won't take you seriously, and when you listen to an hour, all you can hear is the effort. She's taking a voice down to somewhere where she probably didn't really want to be. And that's the majority of the argument. You hear the falseness for like that sort of. I'm down here, I can't even catch the lowdown as the, she again, she, I didn't remember that. So these things. So the very fact that so much effort expended on it means that it is a real thing. It's a huge factor. I can think of, um, you know, significant politicians in the past few years who've been largely undone by aspects that people have heard in their voice and that they haven't been able to work around. Well, ed miliband would be an example of somebody that seems like it sounds a bit. What was it, Buddy Hill? Oh, they'll go. Both. Just filled it out. My buttons quite nasal quality to his voice and quite um, it, it, it sounded like it was difficult for him to speak. No. Normally he sounded scared of his voice. That's think something that was said to be sounding voice. So I've worked with someone.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       Listen, he sounded like someone who kind of knew that people were going to be critical of his voice when he started talking. I Sat, it does not, it's not an election for not giving me a bit of fun. Well, I am. I've worked with a performance poet who actually has a very similar voice to ed miliband and he does poetry out, you know, he's out on the streets doing poetry and never, never because it was a bit nasally. I don't think people are enjoying this because he's just, I'm doing my thing and I really wished they'd bill banker just love his voice and forget about what people might say about it because actually it was him, sandy anxious about his voice. His seat was often the thing you were picking up on, like how you lose losing erection if you think about it too much. Sorry. I said that now, like now could we have listened to theresa and then

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Jeremy Corbyn's see if we can judge their voices here that are in parliament. We are going to hear Theresa May's Voice, which Sophie Scott was already said she disliked.

Speaker 3:          00:38:44       What? Did she support the reopening of Wellingborough prison some program or would you rather just sing happy birthday and I'm very happy to wish him a very copy the estate today. Many happy returns. I hope that Mrs Bowen is going to treat the occasion inappropriate manner in the sex club, a sex

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       quip. So for Scott there is some. I mean it feels unfair to which those people's voices, because we've kind of got what we've got and we're criticizing someone's foot, but it's that there is a source of like a foot mouth won't shoes that were too tight. I can't tell you exactly what's happening, but there's something going on that a couple of points in the evening that joke where she lucky tent sound in a vocal folds is giving a weird sort of all. It's a lot. I can't do an impersonation of it and Widdecombe does it a lot. It's got a posh word speaking. You think that. Alright, so we've caught all of this stuff. There's obviously a neurological component until after we have discussed this, but there's an anatomical component of course to voice it says something that's happening at the level of the vocal chords and you think that sometimes there's a little strangulated how you hold at.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       Well, you know, bearing in mind everything about your voice is reflecting a lot of complex stuff about you, but actually it's diff. Big differences do come in and how you use your, your larynx, your vocal folds. So, um, that's coming in in terms of just what have you got. So men have larger vocal folds that are thicker, so just like a larger musical instrument, they make a lower sound. And I'm the French horn. The producer of this show plays French horn. So I just gave me a little look then because I knew we'd be thinking about.

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       But even then if you, um, if you hold your vocal fold slightly differently. So I, I'm right now doing something called modal voice and they just, you know, that's how, that's how I know using tricks, how I am vibrating, the vocal folds. So all you do to vibrate them as you bring them together and then you're, you're, you're using your chest actually to produce a very finally controlled flow of air out. So they fly back and forth and make it sound. Just like Gareth playing. He's French horn when he's doing the same thing at his lips.

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       That's where you really can play. So you've got this, you've got this musical sound here, but in fact even if you hold them under slightly different tension and I'm not, now I'm doing something cool, creaky voice voice and it's, it's actually holding the vocal folds in a slightly slack away. So they vibrate differently and you get this, you get some soda, sounds a bit more laid back to us actually. Although they porsche wave speaking David Cameron and incredibly creaky voice. That's that. And it's a massive part of American accents. So it's actually one of the main one, the main place where you'll find creaky voice

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       of my voice. Right here I am. This is me just talking. Now. I'm trying not to be self conscious. I'm trying to be a normal man. I have got a little bit water caught on the Tom and Jerry Punch. Whatever. You just get that. If you know Tom and Jerry Punch bag proper. According the Tom and Jerry a punch bag, you have a very interesting voice because you really do use melody a great deal and you're obviously you don't. I'm new here. Comes in, comes the scientist to tell you that you also speak quite quickly, actually combines to give quite a pleasant way. Christ on Mount Sinai. It would've been good at talking one day. Jesus. He must have been hearing from us well into it. Let's face it, it caught on. There's actually something really central about humans standing up and talking and people or doing things with their voices.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       People like watching it. We like watching somebody speak with skill. We like watching somebody saying, we love watching somebody big box. We're like watching actors. We, we actually, there's something really entrancing about the performance of the voice. What'd you think about Hitler then? Not as policies. There's face it now we can say that he was a cruel man, like he's vocal style. Putting that to one side moment for crimes. He seems to have been a very engaging public speaker. There's a wonderful quentin crisp quote satellite. Someone asked him, why did Hitler have charisma and credit? Crispin said, well, I suppose he must have done otherwise. You wouldn't have an awful lot of people now have a certain age wandering around Germany saying, well, I really don't know what came over me. So he was obviously able to. Yeah, create the same man. Quentin crisp offered this definition of charisma.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       The ability to influence without logic. Yes. An interesting definition of that. So like, because like when I watched hit lab, we're trying to do for science against Hitler obviously, but I think, I don't know if I'd like someone going on like that at me. He's really ranting and raving. He seldom mellow. Well I think it's, suppose you just get these big fashions as well. So we've seen it recently in politics, big changes in what we think sounds like appropriate. You just don't get Neil Kinnock style rhetoric in government now for us here, we've moved very quickly through that and you, you get these big changes and even see it in acting. If you go back, you know, over the last century styles and what looked like naturalistic acting change a lot. So what we want to see in a talker can be highly variable. If you get that in and everything, it's what humans do, what we are cultures learn and develop and change.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       We don't tend to sit with just one thing going, this is the best it will ever be. What are the external factors that are changing? Something as seemingly fundamental is natural, but you know, like this is what is natural with natural alters. Because natural means essential. Natural means without inflection. Natural means absolute and total. And if that changes as a result of acculturation, what is being expressed? And one of the reasons I'm interested in voice, you know, to share that shit with Juliet says in Romeo, Juliet, like voice, voice, be breath and breath be life. But it's like it's something about essence. And like in the beginning there was the word or the vibration, and I've heard these interesting sound from deep space. It sounds like gongs vibrating

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       into the infinite, that there is something like in the way that we communicate that is connected to truth very, very deeply. And if this is something that can be manipulated and managed and used, his power could potentially be limitless. Well, it can be. And you can certainly think of examples where we get caught up in this element of performance. I suppose one thing is true, it's all a performance. Me Talking to you now, I am performing being so fee. There's never a, some abstract notion of uh, sophie voice. There's always been doing it for someone somewhere in some particular context. I'm never speaking without reference to that. And then there's the performance where we as a group of people decide to shut up and let some people worse than onstage, do something with their voices were we then engage with that and what's expressed in that changes.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       So we know over a lifetime all of us treat talk differently as we get older because the people around us change how they speak and we pick up on that. Even the queen speaks differently to how she used to speak her vows. Shay, now your majesty, She's changed. She's chopped it up a bit shallow and it sounds, it sounds like a continuous process of everybody coming a bit less posh. That's back to old dvds. I even don't have to go back very far like TB programs in the nineties. You watched the news that everyone sounds incredibly posh and they will have sounded much less people in the fucking sit down and tolerate this path. Well, I'll tell you what that is. I do think whether I won't tell you because you're an expert, I'm just some bloke who's it for about it for half an hour, but what I reckon it is is that because of mass communication, we're all aware of broader context and different variables and are able to make different comparisons and now there's sort of an emerging narrative that power is corrupt and power is connected to, I don't know, poshness and elitist.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       So there's a lot of myself, my accent changes. I'm terrible. May Have bounced up and down that class ladder like little trees, football, la. Like when I'm the sort of around like sort of like my girlfriend really tormented me for a. she's that how much I love working class men. Like when we went to think it was called Drusen to pick up some gravel. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that that's my life. And there's this bloke there called mark and he came over and wanted to fight ots that and I was like a lot and I said goodbye to him in an overly elaborate way and even waved at him a second time. I went back for another bite of a cherry out the window, but no, actually I think I like that so I might turn off, but you don't need sand so that I might.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       I taught our power how much sodium or for power? The tomatoes are bloody cockney absolutely ridiculous. What's going on with it. That's exactly why we change our voices. Interestingly, the more we. Let's again, we have to change our voices to talk to somebody so soon as we started talking to each other without agreeing to do so, we started to breathe together because you have to do that to have a conversation. You have to coordinate how you breed because that lets you time voices going back and forth, the turn taking conversation, so physical. It really is, and we also matched

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       the pro, the pitch and positive voices and the rhythm of our voices. We still have to bring together because you've got this very rhythmic. He's like, he's like a dance conversation and you can only do that dance if you start to align your behavior so that has to happen to talk, and then the more you like someone, the more you will start to do other things, to change your voice, to bring it towards them. So there are studies that have shown that the more a man likes a woman will, he will raise the pitch of his voice to be near to hers just now. Like everybody's super self conscious,

Speaker 5:          00:48:03       right,

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       and you believe that you'll start to use the same words. You start to use the same pronunciation, jeep and start to use the same grammar as each other and the and the more you like the communication here. That's the whole point of it is that we're trying to make a connection with one another. We're trying to defy the material prison of our anatomy. You're feeling trapped and it's the voice, this thing that he's not really holy or truly you, but a vibration emanating from you that is your misery that you've sent out in the world to make connections and communication with God. I'm making this shit up, God, but it, and it's always there, so it's always expressing like a lot of you that you don't realize and it's also expressing how you feel about the people that you're talking to fairly unavoidably. Oh No.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       I'm going to start watching myself back on the because we do a bit of funny bit in my standup show, right where I talk about when I did this interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of the things that we make jokes about, I'm going by we. I mean me because clearly I consider myself for about nine people might actually have people that work with her in the room. I'm like, is that I love about how I go through these different personas when dealing with Jeremy Paxman, they start very light and affable. Then there's a moment where I got really serious and then I get very sort of. I like I started deliberately or not deliberately, but unconsciously referencing ethnic speak rhythms, very working class base because I obviously see myself as speaking on behalf of outsiders and I use it as an attack technique. It's very interesting to watch and your marketing, um, because we can mark similarity with it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       You can mark difference because I get right because I'm definitely not trying. I didn't go good. I knew I'd have to say. I'm like, no. Listen brother. I think it's absolutely ridiculous. It's like a grime single, but it's still playing that your apps, your. I was marking out your position to him as clearly and how you're doing that. What you're saying. I'm not like, you're not actively want to be you, God. I'm just telling myself. Right. So that's because I suppose the reason that we wanted to talk to you, Sophie Scott, is for us to understand how. Excuse me, we can use these means of communication, comedy, laughter, and vocal style, but a, Oh yeah, this is good. This is a better question than minuses gas because like, yeah, this is, it's more succinct way of saying what vocal techniques should be aware of, should we be aware of in the lead up to the election from Theresa May, Corbin and other

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       political leaders. What should we watch out for? There's very strong outbreak. If people just going back to the same phrase, strong and stable, rigging the election and just keep saying and even with the same breath, it's like they're just cutting and pasting into the stream of speeches. Why is this happening? What's this? There was the assumption, I've got no attention span and we're bloody idiot. What's going on? There is a fear. It is. I think there's very good evidence that humans are not good at remembering detail. I remember just just remembering the just you bloody idiot. They think that's it. I think they're trying to influence the just and that just you let that just be what it is. When we met with surely creditors with the ability to understand at least some different words that mean strong and stable, you know, rather than just repeat just exactly the right and foreign and color, but no just bombard people in to do if people are beleaguered, fearful and last the whole time.

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       If you just keep staying strong and stable, strong and stable, who you're gonna vote for him starting to roll out of order and if there's one of the odd things about people using lightheartedness or comedy in their voice or in their approach, particularly in politics, it can play hard. Well and it can also go horribly wrong, you know, but there is a exactly like you said, right at the top, there are situations where it's simply inappropriate and people will sort of recoil from it like that. That wasn't right then there, but in other situations it can be an incredibly efficient way of looking confident and able and like, do you know what? I can do this. Yeah, because what you're saying is I'm not defined by this context, but that is a risky game to say that I'm outside of this context. It's about power obviously, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       Because if people say it's not appropriate for you to say that in this context by saying I'm in charge of the context and if you say I disagree with you, then you're saying I'm in charge of the context is a real game. It is, and I think sometimes one of the things that we like about people who would be prepared to use not necessarily like you very rarely see somebody in politics or just like all party all the time, it just doesn't work, but drops would drop into is occasionally when it feels like, or it could have gone a different way. Now they've just sort of thrown a um, something slightly lighter hearted there. That's kind of, it's not just that, oh well I'm in here for giggles, but I'm kind of confident enough to let you know that this is easy. This is nothing to worry about.

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       I can do this. And of course that might still be a bad thing. I'm not saying it's a signifier of someone's good, but it's certainly one of the things that is sorely lacking. I think at the moment people quite seem quite frightened of what they're saying and have going off message. I think a climate of fear is what Jay is prohibitive and restrictive. I bet. Fear literally affects us anatomically and constricts the vocal cords and socially it does that. People are less likely, you know, like when when I do live shows now and as I go out of metropolitan areas, I think there's a nervousness when I talk about Islam, when I talk about like sort of subjects that we've been taught to understand as contentious and we therefore shouldn't laugh from

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       them because I don't know what I'd be looking like that agreeing with that, where we go laugh though, isn't it? That's the, that's where the communication becomes valuable, but what we include in what's humorous. Now of course we won't be derisory dismissive or cruel about things that are important, but I think humor precisely builds these bonds as it does between a father and a baby. It does between whole communities recognizing that ultimately with the same. I mean I've, I might posit dear Professor Sophie, that's what comedy is continually doing is it's sort of, it's shifting the frame and we say like, Oh, here we are. You and I are having this conversation making these podcasts and then comedy says, but we're going to die me. See, he's very, very, very temporary arrangement between us and if we don't acknowledge the truth of the fact that we can't hold this together, that there are powerful elements of not only chaos of entropy and function that are going to mean that everything's going to end.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       Things fall apart. The center cannot hold and like I think comedy is an expression that I'm all right with that. I'm okay with it and I think that like, I use this a lot, but like Tommy Cooper's act, he said, well, the reason I think is beautiful is because Tommy Cooper, British comedian, 30 $40, my God perhaps 50 years ago. And like a lifestyle of that did a photo magic act where things went wrong. And I think the reason it's so ingenious, it's because it's like his intention is like he's not even come on the stage to try and be funny. He's come out to try and do this magic act and everything will be okay if only this magic cat goes all right and the magic act never does. And that's where the intersection of comedy happens there. And if you look at sort of like musical entertainers like Frankie Howard or Kenneth Williams, they always glancing to the side, there's Harry, he'll actually uses that sort of second camera that he talks into sound that there's another layer to reality, that there's a connection.

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       I think between comedy and the trickster and the trickster is forever saying this isn't the absolute contexts. There is another world. There's another world. And in the words of Morrissey, there must be, there must be, you know, like. So that's what I think is important about comedy. Do you now think I'm clever? I'm like, you're doing an man so as you must be, but it's um, the clearly extremely well put point. Pay Them. I, we pay them to go. It is very interesting. If you look at the history of human language, and of course we were reliant on people writing stuff down because words don't stay around. If you state them, they've, you look at wherever you find people writing in human history, you find them writing down jokes. People have been making jokes as far back as we can find written words. They'd been writing graffiti on walls. There's a piece of Babylonian Papaya us with a really weak joke about how to make a fair. I go fishing. Um, you put naked women in fishing nets and maybe it works better in India, in ancient Egypt. Maybe there's a pun in there. In ancient Egyptian, they think, well there's on its own is not enough. Put Women in fishing nets. Drill fire could come into the pyramid. No, you probably can't get out of here. There's a whole

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       Roman book called the laughter lover, which is, it's preserved all the jokes and it is interesting because they have the structure and appearance. The jokes, they're not funny. Jim Bowman actually did an act where he read out from it and he had to do a lot of work, a lot of work and it's because of course the, the, the content changes. And I think a lot of the times science when it tries to look at comedy, gets caught up on that because you can't find something that's always funny for everybody everywhere. That one glance at that. But by the Babylonian joke that somebody that was so good, they wrote it down, um, suggest that, but you don't want to forget this thing. Go and get mashups of paper. It's probably a complicated. And then so you've got this. But the point is that people were doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       We have used humor probably from as soon as we had words, we were laughing before we had words and we will probably using words to try and get to laughed and maybe in a playful way or whatever way since then. But then you get this very interesting development as an art form because you see this in humans, you know, endlessly endlessly innovating and producing stuff that doesn't immediately kind of necessarily get you fed or keeps you somewhere to sleep. But which is fun and interesting and engaging. When you see the modern humans may emerge. You just get this explosion of stuff and comedy, I think a huge one of those things. And you start to get the role of the person that you say, the trickster, the person who's the jester, the person who has the role of kind of controlling that. And it's a very, very interesting evolution.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       It's worth bearing in mind that standup comedy is incredibly new art form. The only really existed as we would recognize it with, you know, some one person on stage talking to the audience since a really unfortunate man called Frank Fay. He was around, he was around sort of in the twenties and thirties, but he was the first guy who had the sort of hotspur to not have another person on stage with him. Exactly. So it was to never feed and he didn't have comedy costumes and he didn't. He kind of came on stage not going blog and I'm not putting anything on. And they had this kind of like, it's easy to find some flexible youtube because it's very. It doesn't look like I'm not the strongest material, but it absolutely slayed. And he had this kind of confidence to do this and it was. That was part of you consider themselves to be a lot better than the other comedians must have done because they just have the balls to go up.

Speaker 2:          00:58:55       They June no more light to the feed guy. Phil incarcerate must've been magnificent. We're lucky charms, comedy politics. Well actually also choose politics and the reason why it's not. Oh Frankie, he's not more frequently discussed the. He was a massive Nazi maps upside with Franklin, so very good. This guy, hold on a second. This slaughter all non Christian people killed the Gypsies about him, right? Yeah. No, frank. I'm not going to fly. You're going to need to get advocates. He used to work with. I won't work with fitbit. They bought. Why not have them all? Oh Frank. Horrible Nazi. He was running pro Hitler rallies in New York after police.

Speaker 2:          00:59:43       Pretty much people who felt that was done and dusted. The this Hitler Fella. Hey, bad tool band checked your fucking face. So he's largely not remembered fondly. Really. I'll see frank better commemorate it. Bev, you look at Bob Hope. You can see Bob Hope's act. He was completely influenced by his voice and sort of the appearance and that kind of sophisticated gentlemen act law. What's the great master? So you can see the roots of it there. So they think that that hat on you can sort of see stand up comedy is being another manifestation in our culture of this endless drive for humor, for comedy and we're still, I think negotiating the role of what that means. What's this discussion about like the written word versus or a tree because like I've heard that like there's some people like this in America. He calls himself American Indian actually, sadly deceased called Russell me.

Speaker 2:          01:00:39       It's like that. He says there's this beautiful speech which I read written down, but it begins. Lastly you, yeah, you may very well be reading this, but I'm speaking [inaudible] European people. One of the things you've given us is the written word will. Ours is an oral tradition and we believe in the truth of speech and the parents, which they never had to have a thing about socrates saying that it was sort of more important the spoken word and the written word because there isn't a central truth that can only. I supposed to relate to the voice and the presence. What does this all mean? Well, I think that's exactly because there's the person there. You've got that you're reacting to more than just the words they're saying and you can't not. You're making assumptions about that person. If you couldn't see me, you would probably have an idea of what I looked like based on what I sound like.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       They could be utterly wrong, but we do that all the time. We're always trying to work out who people are, where they're from, all this. At the same time as they're talking to us, we're adding in all this other stuff about who we think they must be based on what they sound like and it gives a power and an interpretation than sometimes the truth to voices that I think does give it a different kind of waste and the written word is amazing, but you can see and you look at people trying to write texts or emails or the way they try and put stuff back in to kind of try and give their character their the emojis or dancing. The emergence of emojis is because of the limitations of the spoken word. I mean, you remember how it used to be like there was too many problems around like miscommunication around text and email and like it was forever happening. We made. I was upsetting people unlike when I'm on radio, I steak right out. I travel. No, no, that was funny. Come on. Do you know what I meant? Smiley face. Apology face. I'm like, but like sort of. I can see that. Yes. There's a level of sophistication that the written word can't deliver

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       and perhaps in the pans of proust and there are other you. So the written word, you can sit there and do some sorts of compositional work on it before you deliver it to the world. You know, when you start talking you've got to keep going. I launched on a sentence and I'm somehow got the make my way to the end of it. Frank fry weren't a racist. Oh it is this sky and bloody well and another thing that this threat chat chat now, but he wasn't like that. He was more of a smarmy character. It was fairly unpleasant. Can't be a Nazi. Gone mostly say a cow. Oh yeah. We had this thing, professors sophie, that a aint helpin the satire satirizing trump, that it makes him more cozy and likable, ineffable somehow, and it's just not a monster vacation. It's sort of affable. I think it is sometimes the case that we can mistake laughing at somebody for being like the end of the critical work we need to do and it was associated with them.

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       So it is really interesting that, uh, it was it John Oliver a couple of years ago was going, oh, please run for presidency is going to be so funny. And it was funny. There were some amazing and it was also actually happening. And then it's actually company. It's funny now I'm still trying to keep it humorous flap just by looking at it as if it's not real, but it is real, isn't it? Yeah. This is actually happening as far as we know, it's actually there and that's now, you know, you can make. It's interesting to see how people make very good at making jokes at the stuff around I'm a trump, you know, all that. Sean Spicer stuff that they're doing so well on snl. It's harder because it's already absurd and point, you know, we were already made all the jokes they were to make about him before he became president and it seems that it's almost like a limit to how far we can go with it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       If you look at, you know, popular sites like the onion. I'm not there making funny jokes but actually not landing on trump because maybe that's already we're already too far into it to be able to have any distance enough to make jokes about it or maybe it's just that it doesn't matter. You know, if you're making jokes, you're still talking about him and he's still winning. Evidently there was a degree of sophistication to that campaign that obviously this of popular press we're not aware of and I think it's sort of like more as well as communicative. It was statistical. I think they understood that these people in this area want this message. Give them that message no matter what the people over there think they're never gonna vote for you anyway. Forget them. I mean you can sort of see as well, so communicate the relationship between communication and truth versus authenticity.

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       Like, you know, like the white sort of politics has changed in that it seems to be this peculiar. It's dance or manipulation of power now. It's notable. I think that there's a sort of now kind of redundancy to Ukip. You kind of think ukip done its job. The Conservative Party is you kip now, so it doesn't really, you don't really require one for Raj has so disappeared like an of a tenor to. It's interesting that I would use that kind of a vocal or word not just to impress you, but also because it seems right that there's, there is this something tonally about the conservative party that seems to be acknowledging exclusion that the anti immigration rhetoric, this vague xenophobia and of course the removal from the European Union itself. It's present, it's present now politically. There's doesn't seem to be any need for it now for Ukip. I mean primarily I entirely agree.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       It's, um, it's been an interesting cycle to watch it happen and there was something similar happened in the seventies, but the really far right organizations which were essentially expressly incorporated into Margaret Thatcher's version of conservatism and we've seen an nf and stuff. Yeah, the, the British National Party that can do, you know, and they were pretty full on and there was kind of an extension of what the Conservative Party roughtly colored as a remit that just started, just incorporate it. And they did indeed go away, is gangs of skinheads at rallies, but they then became the government got rid of those gangs of skin edge around. It's almost like God, the government now still agreeing with it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's very interesting. Sophie. Sixteen minutes. We've done. This has already been longer than I anticipated. I really enjoyed the analysis of the politicians. I liked the role of laughter. Should we try and find something optimistic to end upon?

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       I mean if laughter and Kim and communication and it's ultimately about creating a community, then perhaps they will always be. There has to be a role for or authenticity doesn't there. There has to be a way that we can communicate those central truths and it will bring people together. They aren't or can't be. This reductive, repetitive, simplistic, disingenuous politics that's come to govern our time. This kind of casual, halfhearted, almost nihilism of, uh, of the trump presidency, the madness of the lurch to the right across the world. Is there another way? Is there another way? I mean, I. something that you've kept talking about in your, that was really badly put. Was it something you kept talking about? You keep coming back to love and I think there's, I think we haven't been very good at recognizing the importance of law. You shouldn't be embarrassed about that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       Why? So That's interesting. There's been removed from the, from the centric the bay. We've been told like don't talk about love is stupid. It's childish. I mean this attack on Jeremy Corbyn, Martin headed by Boris Johnson were saying stuff like that. You know, if you're at eaton saying things like that probably gets you to the top. Probably get first dibs on the facts if you can come up with a little lyric like that. But like saying that, oh, he's too compassionate, he's too kind. He wouldn't nuke people willy nilly. It's not saying that there's no room for love or compassion or connection like that. These things are sort of, they have no place in the, in power, uh, but they, they're central to our lives. So here's an example that all the evidence

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       now seems to suggest that losing your hearing in adulthood is a significant risk for dementia. Whoa. Recap. And it's a significant risk. Why? Pay attention to how loud headphones on when you're listening to music. But it's, um, it's interesting because it doesn't seem to be because it's happening to the same mechanism. It's not the same thing that's affecting your ears as affecting your brain. It seems to be because losing your hearing and not necessarily getting access to ways of restoring that takes you out of social interaction, disconnect and you go mad and you wear your brain does not work as well. Everything that we know about human brains say they evolve in interactions, they develop in interactions. Everything. Your baby's learning about the world, most of it she's learning and interactions with you. She got no pressure, but that's the and it continues being the case.

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       It's our main way of making, maintaining social bonds, remained talking to each other, even in a world where you could do it all we text, we still go face to face, we still talk to each other and that is essential to our function as humans and I think we are getting less and less kind of, um, well even the reason that we don't seem to be able to get this message across the, you know, that the hearing loss is really risky for you, not just because it's a pain in the neck to lose your hearing, but it could really manifestly affect the shape of your life. We're not even taking that seriously as a problem. It's like, yeah, well that's one to watch out for them and it's that. It's the link, the social link, the human contact that that's actually preventing that. I think we start to need to acknowledge more, and I'm going to obviously I'm saying so from a scientific perspective because I think in science we tend not to take these things seriously.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       We study speech without ever considering that we talk to each other, we study emotions and never look at laughter, you know, we just don't go in that direction very often, but I think it might be a wider part of our debate about who we are as humans because you know, to be massively influenced by your interview with Adam Curtis, that the rise of individualism I think sometimes takes the emphasis off what we're doing to each other and more onto us somehow powering through life on our own towards death and actually it's not trivial. That's the contact we have with other people is not a meaningless aspects. That extra little bit of cheesecake in our life. It's. It's actually essential to being a human. That's beautiful. What a lovely way to end. Professor Sophie Scott. We must communicate. We must connect. There's more to life than being an individual. As a beautiful message. Thank you very much. Thank you for getting under the skin with me. Professor Sophie Scott. Oh.
