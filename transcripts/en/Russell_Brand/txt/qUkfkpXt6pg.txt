Speaker 1:          00:00:00       My mind is an award winning Canadian writer and comedian who's performed sent out seasons in Australia and Britain, London nominated for best show at this year's Edinburgh Festival. Her current show, Dope, examines a lifetime of obsessions, fandom, and addiction. She has appeared on BBC two live from the BBC and comedy central, and recently presented her critically acclaimed series, may Martin's guide to the 21st century sexuality. They wouldn't be an article before that may mountains guide to 21st century sexuality on BBC Radio Four. May. Martin, thank you for joining me on under the skin. Thanks for having me. I'm a fan of. You seem like a pretty advanced person. Thank you very much. Thanks. You're an addict like me in recovery for ages now. I'm maybe 10 years. Yeah. How did you know that you, uh, had a problem with substances and that you needed to change? It was all kind of.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       My teens were kind of explosive and I started doing comedy really young. I think you did. It didn't, you know, as young as you like. 11 warning has. Well, when I was 11, a comedian like got me up on stage and made me be his ventriloquist dummy so I wouldn't count that. But when I was stand, even though seeing that pioneering experience, yeah, he, he, uh, I was in the front row, I always loved comedy and then he got me up and he said I'll squeeze the back of your neck and you open your mouth and I'll make you say stuff. But he thought I was a little boy because I was in like a three piece suit. And so he's making me say like filthy stuff. And Anyway, it was fun and got lots of laughs and then got obsessed with it. Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       So then in my teens I started doing drugs and I got kicked out of my house and ended up, my parents were, well they read my diaries. Actually I'd, I mean rookie mistake had been keeping these like meticulous diaries and they found out all this stuff I've been doing. And then I guess their reaction was some level of anger and they were doing tough love. So they said he can't live here anymore. And then I think that was a 16. I was very, very young. Yeah. That's in Toronto. Is it? I suppose that's the age when I first moved out when I was 16 or so. Kind of in pursuit of addiction. Yeah. What made me leave except the addiction itself. Thinking about it now, the reason that you're a fascinating guest, of course, your within the field of comedy, you highly respected and you're doing brilliantly. But also I suppose topically you're doing stuff that's kind of defining of our time. You'll show before your last ones about gender and gender identity. You most recent shows about addiction in a sense like in anglophone and can possibly non anglophone countries. These are determining ideas like whereas people look to understand evolving and dissolving forms of categorization. We look for different ways to understand ourselves. Can you talk us through whether or not that question is clever that I've just or observation. It wasn't really a question, was it?

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       It's very clever, very flattering. Um, but yeah, I think uh, when you hear the word spectrum a lot and I think, well with addiction anyway, I think if you've had a problem with drugs and then you've acknowledged I'm an addict, it can be quite isolating and you feel like you're part of this kind of small subsection of the world who just can't handle their shit. And then it's been, I mean this is a really recent thing for me just reading about it and learning about like the biochemistry of it and recognizing addictive behavior in other. All this stuff you've been talking about, but I think you're further along with it. The man still like my mind is blown and suddenly you're like, oh, it's a spectrum of behavior. And I think it's the same thing with sexuality. You can think on this weird, you know, queer person and then you think, well everybody has a sexuality and it's a spectrum.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Yes, it's extraordinary actually. It's something I've only been learning about because I'm probably substantially older than you and I'm probably educated in different way had difference of cultural references. When I see something like 40 percent of people under 25 don't identify with a sort of a homogenous sexual group in a more interested in fluid of a, you know, even though I think of myself as sort of a countercultural person, I'm sort of. Oh, I know me too though.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       I mean I'm 30, I think of myself as pretty like cool, but then I do gigs at universities and like freshers wigs and there I don't know the right terminology and I'm putting my foot in my mouth and they're so tuned into it. They've got all gender neutral toilets and they're all have crazy terms for themselves and it's awesome. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       In a way it sort of makes sense, I suppose at what you know, someone of my age and older. Is there a very clear identity? Roles are very clear. Social Roles and I, I've been questioning a lot lately what, how I would identify it and how I've grown up if the conversation had been more advanced in my own adolescence because you know, what the main feeling I had growing up in a normal, ordinary Essex home, suburban home was not like the other boys, but turns out that the other boys weren't like the other boys. It's just that we're all magnetized to an imaginary category. And whilst there is, you know, I don't know, Canada is one of the most sort of for most places in there seems like there is a biochemical basis for at least some sort of biological and anatomical aspects of gender. Uh, but, but beyond that, the way people identify, demonstrate and represent their sexuality seems like something that we need to examine a look more closely. What was your observations on that? I think it's so

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       interesting. I think all the way we're talking about, it's all still in its infancy. I think in 25 years it'll be so different, but it's so hard to sort of disentangle, um, cultural influences and stuff in terms of gender roles. And what's normal for men and women, and you're right, there is a biological thing, but this also I'm in, it's so hard. Undo those early influences about what, you know, masculinity and femininity. So yeah, that's interesting. I think if we can disentangle those people be a lot less stressed, I think

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       we're both sort of androgynous looking people within our sort of basic gender group. You're quite a beautiful man. Yeah. I've been told I'm a handsome woman. I get that a lot. Yeah, you're beautiful. Like when I've been doing this, when I've been doing this book, stuff like, you know, when young people are coming to like sort of signings into my show, I've been having sort of conversations that have really opened my mind up. I was speaking to a young person and God now we're gonna have to say they said, you know, identify as binary. I don't identify with any particular gender. And I really felt myself on the precipice of my own understanding, my own linguistic abilities or my own prejudices. I. What do you think is going to be the key component here? Because one of the things that I've noticed around identity politics is people that are sort of our traditional or conservative often feel, I think a lot of shame and a lot of confusion and it can become quite opposition or quite quickly. Totally.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       Um, yeah, I think it's easy to experience like a real sense of vertigo about it because it's just happened so exponentially quickly and, and there's all these new words and it feels like I don't, I don't know how you are at math and stuff, but I, I used to get this panic and math class, like when they would introduce things like Algebra and I and I'd be like, it just doesn't, it's too much information and you just dropped out of school pretty much because I was like. And I think people have that feeling and I think the main thing is just asking questions and then there's the responsibility and the people who are using these new words to explain patiently and we can all just be patient,

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       you know? How, how did you look at these themes in your standup show? Where are you personally on these ideas?

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       Identification I am, I had, my parents were real hippies and um, yeah, so growing up they were always, this is, I mean I'm only just realizing and for moving to England, like how unusual this is that when I was a kid they would always say, you know, you'll grow up and you'll meet a man or a woman and it always, they just presented it as an equal option, but I saw who knows if that's by the. I've always been bisexual, I always dated men and women is, I don't know if it's because they said that or maybe they were like, well she keeps wearing suits and like

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       we should have that three piece suit. You added onto that magician show first. You were overdressed for any gender identity for a magic.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       So tie and suspenders. Yeah. So I was lucky in that area, so I've always been bisexual and that's been great. But yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       what I found surprising as a new father have a female child grant. Thank you. It's blowing my mind like it's really vacillates between this sort of spiritual sense of Oh wow, new consciousness as a merge glory. Glory that she exists and kind of little passed it out. Get off me. Like I said, it really pendula experienced because no control, no off button, extraordinary. But I've become very sensitive in a way that sort of surprises me around identity. Like I guess my wife is more traditional than I am and puts like, you know, sometimes puts her in dresses and things like that and sometimes I'm like I want to just the way things are practical for someone that can't walk up. Right. So she should just be wearing little pants and stuff, you know. And, and like I don't know because in a way you could look at this is that very sort of conventional, an old fashioned idea that perhaps I'm a man who sort of unconsciously wanted to have a male child.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       I don't feel that at all. I don't like the, I don't like any ornamentation of femininity are now because it feels like something's been put on her that's not. She's not choosing. Yeah, they did this experiment. I was get experiments wrong, but I think this is where they had a baby in neutral clothing in the room. Have you heard this? And then people would come in and play with the baby and sometimes they'd say it's a boy baby, and then when they said it was a boy baby, everyone was like bouncing it really aggressive, not aggressive, but really physical and always faced the baby looking away from them. And then when they said it was a little girl, they all turn the baby towards them and just sort of cuddled in like, yeah, that's sort of. So yes. We're not really conscious of how I talk to parents.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       One of the things you hear a lot when you become a bad as people say, oh yeah, but you know, they just do start playing with vacuum cleaners and if they're a boy they immediately signed up to be in the marines and he said, no, you were not aware of the unconscious cues that we have achieved and I'm doing that thing already. Have a lot when people go, because this is a question people like to ask me on chat shows, I like to go where you being such a womanizer, how are you going to feel when you do a $6 industry? Brings home a Russell Bronco. She might not bring home a and she might be a gay person. You don't know who she's going to come home with. Such questions worked.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       I did that too and my friend has an a two year old niece and they came back from some baby thing where they do. Does your daughter do this trick monkey music classes and stuff and all the parents are like, they're so talented like that. So they. They bring the two year old back in. Then I hear myself going, I guess in this smarmy way, like do you have a boyfriend yet to the to like I'm saying that. Why am I doing that? Yeah, right. Look at us. We're not unaware of our own conditioning, so this is some like continually within your standup comedy, is this the kind of perspective you try to have as a comedian? Tell me a little bit about your process of conception. Like how did you come to the idea that you were gonna write your very successful show? Dope. Um, I, I guess it's like we were saying like I always, I've always wanted to talk about drugs and that period and in my life, but I guess I haven't felt like I have enough distance from it or perspective on it to do it in a way where I can keep it really light and be in control of it. And then I had a this breakup like two years ago and it just felt

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       so similar to getting off cocaine. Like it was. I was like, oh, I know this feeling. Exactly. And then started reading about it and then had this, you know, started seeing these patterns in all areas of my life. So then I started improvising it onstage and it was way too dark and then just slowly adding punchlines. Is that what you do? You do like a work in progress and it's like too serious

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       and then you add, you start off your development process is to start with just being very, very honest and personal uncomfortably. So how do you feel what that stage of development?

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       I really enjoy it. I don't know what that kind of masochistic sometimes isn't it? Especially when you're like, I know there's no punchline coming so it's quite intense, but I liked that and then every other year in Edinburgh I do an improvised show where people write down questions and then I answer them and then it comes out of that too because you get to know what people want to hear you talk about and yeah, that's.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       Yeah, I like that idea. I have a similar process for me, my access point for comedy is to start saying things that are truthful often. Actually one of my guiding principles is, does this make me feel a bit ashamed? Totally. Your ears get hot. Well, I don't want people to know that about me. That's awful. And then. But that there's something about that exposure. So what, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of revelations were you making about the breakup? What kind of realizations did you have?

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Just like, I mean they've done, they've compared brain scans, haven't had like a coke addict and someone who says they're madly in love and it's so I just think the hormones and things are insane and during the break if I just, I felt so not like myself and there's such a. So the right thing to do to end up with a relapse and it just, I was using all this terminology that I was like, God, this is. Yeah. And, and not the healthiest relationship to love and how can you lose yourself so completely in it. Yeah. So a damaging relationship. It wasn't the best. Yeah, it was great. And in a lot of ways, but not, not the best, but yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Alright. Right. They were punishing components to it. I've only recently started, you know, like something sometimes I think I'm really clever, but then I realized, no, you're not clever, you're like an idiot because everything takes much too long to realize and really sort of like, I think like a convoluted, complex neurological root to make the most basic observations. Like for sure it's healthy and nature is healthy, but I'm still working on nature is healthy. Very long thesis of examination of grass, the color green photosynthesis into connectivity, the role of oxygen. I mean, I'll look at that for ages before I said, well, why don't you just go for a walk in the woods you said, so you know, like it's taken me a long time to come to terms with that. But I noticed that my own tendency in relationships without being disparaging about the particular individuals I was in relationships with was set up, um, dramatic situations, producing situations.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       And then it's so euphoric when you sued that anxiety. It's this weird cycle. You see the agenda and obviously a analogist to addiction that if you continually find yourself at a place where I'm not good enough, they're never going to call. I'm brilliant. I'm fantastic now to maintain this. Oh No, fucking only pretend to be someone else for another five years. I believe we can have a child. Exactly that. Yeah. Yeah, and that is a little. I mean sometimes I think that substance addiction is the most rational form of addiction because it's a direct route to the good feeling instead of the other ones are quite convoluted. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, and easier to control. I mean, as long as you have sort of a reliable hookup, access to cocaine and heroin or whatever drug is young people take these days is can be much easier than the sort of giddy all for a vertiginous experience of being in love.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       Yeah. So that's sort of what your show is about is it is about how your drug addiction as a young person leading, you'll be expelled from the family home. You found those patterns repeating themselves in romantic situations. Yeah, I think I always just thought I got addicted to drugs and then I went to Rehab and then I've been clean ever since and I never really thought about it with much more depth and then now I'm thinking or I mean early on when I was about six, I had mad obsession with Bette midler. Like really? I saw the world through this lens of Bet Midler that just everything's in relation to bet midler. I was so obsessed with her. Every is in relation to pet mate. Yeah. What would bet? Think about this. What's she wearing today? Like I loved her. I mean my grades were slipping at school because I was just sitting thinking about Batman and then comedy and then drugs and then relationships.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       Midler was your gateway? Yeah. What was it about? What was it beat? She's Hocus pocus at that. The one where they are, right. So you're a little kid in Canada, you're in a little three piece suit. Literally this went, I think I saw it 12, 13 times in cinemas and it just, I mean it must've been at a sexual. I must've had a crush on bet midler and I just lost my mind. I said, she's so, what is innovation capacity that she's Sassy, strong woman. She'd take care of us. Wouldn't she? Like, she tells us like it. It's going to be okay. Exactly. Then hold on a minute. It's getting a bit sexual and she'd sort of cut you down quite cruelly, but then you know what I mean? It would be a benefit flash and then beck goes, what are you going to do with that little thing called me out and she goes, oh, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       Oh God, actually I'm getting into like, you're looking at her lovingly. And she's like, why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer. Oh, come on and off for you. Like, um, once I saw her accepted an award at the Golden Globes and she said, how about these couple of Golden Globes gesturing to no breasts? Yeah, that's her style. And some food went all unusual in me, but something glitched eman. I've felt a feeling feeling in my tummy. All unusual. Now, do you think this is something essential? Because obviously bet midler isn't gay icon. Yeah. Odd. Before you would have had any over or cultural sense of a gender or sexual identity that you would automatically found yourself to sort of some sort of quintessential figure within the Pantheon. Yeah, you're right. I mean maybe it was just into witches as well though. I any kind of design, which is a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       There was another one when they were metal street, one of the others or something. Sarah Jessica Parker could have gone for that yet. Not into it. Just because she was the most evil I think. Um, and her voice and. Yeah. No, I don't know. Yeah, it must've been. That happens a lot though. I mean I was obsessed with scary spice, so as a child and then now I'm like, well, she's kind of a gay icon to look at that. So it's weird, isn't it? Because I think a lot about constructs cultural, whether or not we're attaching to these things or if there isn't a central truth in a way this crosses over with some of young's ideas of synchronicity that there is something happening on a psychic level that is relating to the objective world. Whereas of course the materialist will tell you know, these, these are just over patterns that signify nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Things are there, material value. But if you as a little kid into Ron, I've somehow happened upon gay icon, not in a particular content and I know you are. Your identity is more complex than that, but it's just interesting that, that figure is she. Because I've never understood. It's not like Bette Midler, she's not gay or anything. Is it a particular person? Yeah. I think it's her, her confidence and, but yeah, you're right, I guess. Um, yeah. When, when people in huge numbers respond to the same thing quite emotionally, then yeah. That there must be some universal. Yeah. Youngian thing that you're responding to it. It can't be just that there's a great pr team or whatever. There must be some central resonance now. Where did you graduate to a after Bet Midler, not necessarily in terms of crushes, in terms of your, uh, what would you feel like your next attachment and then comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       So yeah, when I was 11 and 13 niche comedy and I started doing standup when I was, I had braces and I'd be in my school uniform and come from school smoking this weird sort of circus act and um, did it every night of the week. And, and that's a highlight. Any other isn't it? Very much, but what was your APP like? You say, well, you've got some props, I'm guessing. No, I just, I was, I mean I went through so many different just imitating people based because I didn't know who I was. I was, I wonder phase where I was just doing, but basically bill Hicks and then smoking, smoking three piece suit, a little kid like character knighted character stuff and just tried all kinds of things. All so terrible. Thank God. Like no one had smartphones. Isn't it interesting? One of the things I identify with the May is this idea of being a little kid and not feeling particularly connected to the place where I was and feeling a little bit lost and adrift and for, for me, like, you know, when a first sort of via my cousin's heard the smiths and then sort of looked into the character of Morrissey, so I'd think, oh, okay, this guy and let you know that they're someone that's beautifying outsiderness and vulnerability and that's, that can be a bit of an access point.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       And then like through Morrissey you get to learn about, oh, Morrissey's interchange deems you start getting into that type of cinema and Morrissey's into Oscar Wilde. You start learning about Oscar Wilde and you know, then you get into aesthetics is interesting, isn't it? How sort of, you know, like as opposed as a person. My framework for understanding reality is spirituality and specifically spirituality through the Lens of addiction. So it's about understanding how I form attachments, but culture does have a great potency and can be a way to understand yourself in a situation in the world. It has great beauty in it, so and like Bill Hicks again was a very significant figure for me because like, you know, in I suppose slightly more sophisticated way and perhaps a more mature way, I don't know because I was an adult when I first saw Bill Hicks and thought, Oh my God, that's how you're supposed to do stand up comedy. I've been very curious to be a tiny little kid and trying to appropriate that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Yeah, I guess I must have. I mean it's hard to remember how I felt at the time and I must've felt a sense of otherness and then especially in high school and probably feeling a bit gay and then go in and find in a comedy club where people were not only like declaring what was different about them and weird, but then being applauded for it and yeah, that's probably pretty mind blowing. Is it true here? I'm just looking at my notes that you've turned up smoking a cigarette like quite early, like you were smoking cigarettes on stage. I just thought comedian smoke. I thought that was that scene, like Richard Pryor and stuff. So I, I, uh, yeah, I went on with a cigarette and people were just, I mean there were so it was silent, but they were, it was like concerned silence because they were like, who has allowed this to happen? Who should we, should we notify and yeah, there's some notification so that you will, it was the famous

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       second city of the second series I started in Chicago, but it's sort of like a byword for sort of improvisational brilliance and sort of the sort of vanguard of comedy. Right. So you were involved when you were little kid in that world. We're,

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       yeah, I started. Um, yeah, I started out there for a few years and then, uh, and then eventually when drugs kind of took over and replaced comedy, then I got banned from second city for two years from. And that was devastating because I loved it and idolized all those people. And I think suddenly everyone twigs, oh, this person is too young to be so high all the time in this building. So then I got banned from there. But what we're doing, I mean everything like mostly coke was, it was the big one.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Yeah. I was disposable cash from comedy to. I think I just don't give a teenager any money. I know it's a very natural conclusion to have reminders attended. What are you going to do? Can't do what? Buy Models and factory. And even then there's the clue. So you, you're going to find your way to substances. If you've got cash you can pay with cash in hand for gates much. Yeah. And then it's around and, and then I guess I obviously had this predisposition because a lot of people to coke and never want to do it again. That's right. Yeah. We have the predisposition. Are you doing drugs with adults? Yeah. Big Time. That's weird, isn't it? Yeah. Looking back, I think it's weird. At the time it felt so natural because I wouldn't give a child drugs not going to come out on a limb. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       But so I suppose thinking about it, the first time I got heroin it was often children, like they really. So far, I mean I've got that now. If they were Turkish, I've always assumed they were Turkish, but that's just my personal bigotry because they were so young, dark skinned, glads in Hackney, 19 myself, but they were possibly 13. They're adorable, jared guys to skinning up with heroin and I've got some off of him. Absolutely. Terrific. Because you might imagine, and really that's of it is interestingly, so you've, you've had the access to the world of comedy now, but you sort of blended headlong into the, into diction, I suppose you were dealing drugs as well. Yeah, I was very, I think I was with these adults who were doing drugs. I think it was very convincing about not being a teenager. I mean they knew I was, but I was.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       I think I really did my best to put everyone at ease with doing drugs with me and, and it's not a big deal. And so I don't, you know, they weren't villains, but there are definitely some inappropriate behavior for sure. Yeah. That's not judge them. What about the, uh, the drug dealing in any good at drug den and we're now tell me the key problems. Just it just terrible at it, bad at math, but at selfcontrol I'm sort of going a lot of people, a lot of money gets quite scary very quickly. Um, yeah. Probably you broke biggie smalls. He's golden rule. Don't get high on your own supply. Learned from biggie theaters. I did a small amount of miserable measly, unsuccessful drug dealing myself. Yeah. My mate mark gave me quite a lot of amphetamines. He said sell that your school and you couldn't make some profits and this business model.

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       But the problem was is that I was friends with a couple of bigger boys and like took some of those drugs and I couldn't keep charging them because of just, it was like they was too much fear in the relationship and I ended up swapping my bicycle and I took too much of them amphetamines and it ruined my performance was macbeth, if I may say so I think I'd feel a lot better. I would pay so much money to see you doing macbeth as a teen. He wouldn't have liked it maybe because it was regarded as a failure when you were at drama school. They divide up a play into all the various, you know, like, because everyone's got to have a go at being macbeth in it. I was just doing one bit the bit I was doing this, it's just murdered king down Kinedyne.

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       I feel familiar with the play and he comes out with the DAC is right or sort of he's just done a terrible murder and it feels awful about it and I shouldn't have done it. But because I wasn't the type of actor would do any prep instead of crap. I fought speed. Right. So I've done some speed instead of like learning about dockers and murders and stuff like that. So I come staggering out as a kite. We've got butter knives out of the canteen. But. So the fact that you wouldn't be able to murder a king with those butter knives. Richard. And did you had you learned the words or not? Oh yeah. I learned those words, but I think what it would have been like an amphetamine drug. It's going to make you. I think it doesn't put you in the pit of your belly.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       It takes you into, puts you into the upper Chakras, whereas I think doing a murder, you'd probably be really in your guts. It's very earthy thing, isn't it? To murder someone, particularly for your ad out to do it with a butter knife. You'd been plunged into those ribs. You'd have. I mean, your pupils are dilated to be sweaty, but yeah, you're right. I know I fought that while I was doing was a good job, but you know at the end when they tell you whether or not you had done a good job, the teacher said that was not a good job. Unanimously. Only one lad in the year below said off what you were good the way you've done that. It was mental. I said, thanks. I'll clean mark where he was not a person whose opinion could be relied upon and it doesn't have any Kudos within the school system.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Certainly I couldn't use it to press, you know, that loud in the low year for I was good. Well, whereas when I was in year four, I guess maybe I was eight or nine, I did Charlie Brown and I played Charlie Brown is like my crowning moment in school and uh, I took it so seriously that I did this monologue in it and I cried real tears. Like I really went for it and there was. So, I mean, it's like, it's a comedy. Everyone was horrified. They thought something had gone wrong. And why was it about Charlie's monologue that made you think tears would be appropriate? My, well, I'll tell you, he's sitting at lunch and there's this girl over there and she's ignoring him and he just wants to share his peanut butter sandwich and then he, he's like, oh, nobody likes me. And that I really went for it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       I got a really felt that my parents were like waving at me, crying a little ice age, floods of tears. Charlie Brown over what some would think of as a minor misdemeanor, but I think in that were the seeds of what would become a great career as a performer. One of the things you've talked about in your show a dope is sort of neurological and scientific representations of what you've experienced personally. Just a little bit about that. Well, I mean, I've watched some Ted Talks I've read. I definitely will get it all wrong I think, but I think there's this some addiction specialist called Gabor metallic. Do you know him? Yeah. I'm fascinated by him. I was reading this book last night and I think we're going to get him on this podcast. I interviewed him for him and he's like, he could have a cult. He's so amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       His voice is so deep and he'd be. He'd love to speak to him. We interviewed him. Tell me all about it. Well, he, he talks about dopamine levels and I'm like, uh, if you. One of the theories is if you have a dopamine deficiency, then when you do get a hit of that pleasure chemical, it's so overwhelming and then the cravings really intense. So that's what he talks about and about looking at the origins of addiction and in early childhood where your brain chemistry is all getting wired up and stuff like that. But that can be quite uncomfortable. I think looking at your own early childhood, I don't know. I. It's hard as an because you want to take full responsibility for all your actions and you never want to feel like you're casting blame, especially on your parents who you. But everybody. I mean we're so fragile and we've all got weird.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       You know, one of the challenges I think my, if the logical model of addiction is the kind of places people that are addicts in the position of a kind of sufferer through anything about it and we'll Poli. It also lets the culture of the hook. You know, where there is sort of so many cultural forces that you want imagined and it seems to suggest exacerbate addiction inequality, poverty, persecution in talking particularly about within America. But it's true. It's interesting to note the theories of the dopamine deficiency could be the biochemical root of what we identify as addiction. And it would also make sense of the idea that the patterns are replicated regardless of the object, whether it's a sort of a crazy relationship of substance, a career in comedy or Bet Midler who sort of chasing the same thing. Yeah, exactly. And I think, um, I'm also been really interested in.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       I didn't realize how like how malleable we are and how your, how, how you can affect your brain chemistry with just things like your social environment. I mean even now as adults and you can boost your dopamine levels of exercise and things. I just didn't know. We were so malleable. You're right, you had a sort of a fatalistic model of just like, Oh, I'm just this, this is how I feel. This is something I'm learning that now go and live in the country. Don't stimulate yourself into a frenzy to meditate twice a day, do exercise, don't look at pornography. Like sort of like very sort of simple rules of how to create a spice in your consciousness. That's pleasant. I'm still getting there. You've. Yeah, everything he said. That sounds so nice. Why? What's your life like now? My mind just running around, I'm on my phone a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       I don't know. I probably drank too much. I mean, but I, you know, I exercise, I eat, I eat really well. I'm trying to like, it's balance isn't it? I know I should live in the country. I should live in the woods, but it's hard, isn't it? Yeah. It's pretty hot down. Then would say, well why haven't you got embraced an abstinent model if you've identified as an addict's quite early in your life? And I'm going to be a really puritanical and judgmental now for a bit. It's a good question. I mean, I don't, I, yeah, yeah. I've never, I've never, I don't drink every day. I look good. I know you're right. I think the next thing to go probably, but um, your foot a, you're successful. So. But it, what is interesting when you in that position, because I had these weird little rushing early life.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       I was like 24 and I was being on MTV and I had a radio show on Xfm. Maybe it was even coming out of one of these bloody rooms, like this one was certainly this building, but I'd like at that point was escalating as a drug addict, you know, when you sign, when you, as a young person you had access suddenly to ready money, like just addiction fuel, what they must have paid me. Heroin saved me the exchange, you know, so like now that you're, now that you're at this position, you're becoming successful, you're on the precipice, I would imagine have a sort of a different kind of success, that tipping point where we're probably going to get your own TV show soon possibly, or make a film and those kinds of things we're probably going to happen. So like what are you going to do to stay stable?

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       Straight and narrow? I think, um, I mean I, I've practiced pretty rigorous, um, you know, therapy and things. I go to Ebay and I and I surround myself with really good people and yeah. So you're in support groups and during therapy I go to support groups and I'm also in fair Ipi and I'm always, what I'm continually looking for is what is the most recent, you know, like or covenant rather, what is the current manifestation of my addictive behavior and that's when it starts to give them the, as we've talked through your root in a sort of a seemingly innocuous and culturally recognizable and acceptable forms of addiction, right? Until he eventually necessarily in fact deposits you if you're an extreme. Addicts were right in the ass end of chemical dependency or if you'd have a less severe strain, one can hover along, you know, sort of in banal forms of mental tyranny through addiction.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Me, what I have to do is sort of like look at like the thing that I like about a 12 step recovery, the top recovery I believe in is it brings you to a place that's recognizable from other forms of spirituality. I stay in the moment trying not to be so self obsessed. Do Service for other people, like things that like, oh, this crops up in every bloody religion. This doesn't, it sort of really, really works. That stuff keeps cropping up. It's got to be the route to the solution for sure. I think, um, yeah, being vigilant and uh, yeah, I got to get into nature though. I mean it's, I'm really bad with technology. How are you with that with your five? Like if I like what I've done now, my friend over there, Jenny who works here, I don't have my password no more for um, for twitter because what I do is I tell myself I'm just because I'm on a book to just having a look for business reasons for long, you know, you get too deep into it and those, all of those apps are designed now.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       People that have been there come from Silicone Valley and works and those projects are saying, you know, that will deliberately designed to sort of trigger a response. It's not painful. You might decide that they're attractive and appealing. That's what you do. You're not going to make an APP. So it's bloody bullring done to do that, isn't it? It's crazy. And everyone, I mean everyone kind of casually says, oh yeah, we're all addicted to our phones and it's like, no guys, we are all addicted to our phones. It's quite, it's quite bad guys because like one of the things I've said in this article that was written in the Guardian the other day was that like, is something that your attention is being continually competed for. You don't. You don't know how to come down. But sometimes the desire to look at my phone is so overwhelming.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       It's ridiculous. Things like light and the guy, this guy that designed the like button for facebook before that, it had been some other type of button. He came up with it. It's just some sort of 13. I don't know how he does it, drop it. I can't even conceptualize my mind. But you came up with a light button. He says he don't even bring his phone upstairs no more. He plugs it in, in the kitchen at 7:00 PM and that's it. That's the end of it. He's like it. He's had his personal assistant deep like take all the child proofing on his phone. So he himself can't download apps, so the people that know the score about tech saying watch it because David Foster Wallace perspicacious Lee 10 years ago or whenever he sadly died was saying we're going to win this before handheld phones. Really, I think, you know, suddenly smartphones, he was saying we're not far away from a society where you're staring at a screen all the time and the people on the other side of it don't love you and they just want to sell things to you.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       And now we are living in that. Yeah. And it's also worrying with parenting and stuff. I mean you see families out and there's this screen between the child and the parent and uh, yeah, that actually, that doctor talks about it, about gap or does, he says it's because it's not a physical separation with the child, but it's proximal separation because you're not making eye contact, you're not connecting. And that stuff is so crucial for brain development. What does that mean? Proximal separation? I have no idea. I think it means not physically separated, but you're separate because you're in a different space. Ultimately like approximate approximately proxy. Yeah. Right, so the little kid in this case, my little kid in the night garden on this bloody special ipad that bought for children because a like the thing is is that the child does prefer in the night guard than to us.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       It's like given the choice, like if you asked it, it was you want to live with in the night guards or your parents would go in the night guard and I don't even care about them. They're idiots on board, particularly if that one with the beard been like that is what people might call it, a cheap joke, but it's a joke nonetheless to be encouraged in my ongoing quest to make up jokes. Yeah. Come in and my mindset is you identified as an addict quite quite early in your life. You're a person that's on the periphery and precipice of interesting cultural ideas. You're old enough to understand it and to present it. You've been working from lived experience, mirror, important, fascinating. Figure. Tell me what you're going to do now. I'm about to go on tour. Oh yeah, but it's my first tour of dope.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       Yeah, it's a very different tour. The show called dope. Yeah. Yeah. And it's uh, I'm getting untrained, some stain and ibis hotels. I'm doing it tomorrow. Yeah. No, I mean they got like a machine in the corridor that sells food. Yeah. And it's even be in the bed and also washing your hands at the same time. There's like a little sink like the bathroom is within. That could be convenient in some circumstances, but mostly it's troubling. Yeah. My best hotels. I'm an Ivus hotel option bird. You're washing your hands in the sink. You're laying there in the bed. You're on tour. How you started? No, I start tonight. I'm going to Oxford and then a local playhouse, a glee club. Glee Club. Ready for this? The glee club for your whole touring life? Yeah, I think so. It's not that crazy. It shows a week. Something about 18 shows in total, so it's pretty cash.

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       I think I'll get friends to come visit me and I think it'll be fun. And then I meant to be writing a book about, um, for, for 14 year olds about sexuality. So. And write it while I'm on tour. Hold on. Let's quickly promote properly the main mine in a standup show. Dope. How do people get tickets for that? Um, I think they're on May, Martin Dot net. Go on my mind. Don't net buy tickets to see my mind. What can I anticipate in this show? I hate that question when I'm asked it. Let me see if I can pose it better. Tell us something about your show please. That's good to promote it. I mean it's everything we just talked about, but with them jokes kind of. What kind of meetings do you go in? Are you mostly in this type of mood or do you sometimes go jacket and Matt or shouty or like, you know, your Charlie Brown performance?

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       I mostly like there's, I guess I guess I get a little more energetic, but I'm mostly like this extremely affable banks. I think I'm, I think I'm affable onstage. I'm, yeah, you're likable, aren't you? I tell you what's good is, um, while dealing with this complex new language around identity and, and people, the older people having to reexamine their unconscious prejudices is nice to meet people that are potentially able to explain and convey that information, but don't press buttons that you know decade or so ago would have prevented progress. I get loads of people. Well, one more when I talked about sexuality a lot on stage, I'd get people bringing their parents and then coming out to their parents in front of me. Like they'd, they'd wait to meet me and then they choose that moment to say to their parents, actually I'm, I'm gay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       And I'm so not equipped to kind of mediate that exchange. But it was amazing and I guess they, the parents had just seen the show. So they're feeling of, you know, they were in a positive mood and, and then one time a girl said, I'm data, I'm bisexual. And then her dad said, yeah, me too. It was crazy. I know. And then they asked if I wanted to go to ga, why our CEO Bisexual? And he was fucking every night he's like, why do you think I have this earring? He literally said that. That's my boss texture. Leering that are way out. Yeah. That's amazing. Because you go like the priest of a coming out into sort of a modern gender fluidity and sexual fluidity and freeing yourself from previous paradigms. I'm more, I feel like I'm a ill-equipped sometimes, but I get people off and confessing their gay things to me.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       Like people going, my wife is in the toilet, but I just need to tell you. I did give a blow job once and I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to show that just using you as a sort of a vessel for their shame about their sexuality is a great pity, isn't it? That we've become unable to live our own shadows. That our culture has taught us, that there are aspects of our sexual self and identity self. They're unacceptable. I don't want to live feeling shame and stuff and nothing's going to come see your show. God knows what the post show river.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       I don't know what was going on. I kind of stuff. Do you get, I'm now talking about addiction. Do you get loads of people coming after shows and talking about their own experiences? Yeah, there's been a slight hiatus in. It was. I've been deliberately and studiously promoting the book. I've not gone back. I'm back onto, hey, this is good. I'm back on tour, so like I'm going to be like Ross brand.com. I'm on tour again for the next six months. Right? Yeah, and as you I'm sure are aware, I do my level best to appear messianic and romantic while on stage. Go into the as even in the intervals to solve swan about like some classes with ccs of all like, oh, you'd really like it. Like I imagine it's the end of old show now. You're going to be happening now, right? Y'All could be off somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       You should be enjoying your maltesers. Oh No, I'm just wandering around in the auditorium. Positive my top off looking all I'm sad about something on the age of my mind about saying he wouldn't understand. It's too deep. Then people come up and like maybe get. So my friend Matt, or do the radio show, we've. I've seen too many folks are on instagram looking at your to impressing, walking through touching babies and the dash. Right. I'm doing a lot of that. Yeah. Just very entrepreneurial. Like I said, like why don't you try a bit of that walking around. Yeah. I'm very available to available after the show. Are you a single person currently? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's dangerous on tour, isn't it? I mean people. Yeah. I do get a lot of couples actually. That seems to be my niche. Like we want to have a go.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       That's the propositions I get from that. I think. I don't know if it was because of the old inculcation and acculturation early in life, but I've never been that at ease around males and sex. I've been at an orgy where there's been men and I was a younger man. I was involved in a few free sums that had to man in them. I don't need the gentleness. A nurturer of femininity very much resonated with me. When you talked about Miss Midler's, Po Matriarch, some of the energy I'm going for, of course, that sort of literally a married man with a baby and incredibly happy now, but if we're going to talk about one sexual brand, is that stuff but you couples, is it? I get, I get. I get propositions from couples. Yeah. Post your show. It sounds amazing. Blow Job Punch. Hey, I'm going to go. Why do you want to come home with us right now?

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       Coming on May. It's pretty exciting. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I just get straight back into bloody cabin. Back to the MYP. I spoke to a manager. I'll be slamming that vandal shut. Locked me away. And the Ivus. Yeah. Is that really an Egyptian bird? I think so. It sounds like that might be true. It's probably some sort of store probably deliver of new life. I mean why would they have selected that word will work out eventually everything reappropriated by the corporate world. Everything rebranded. So do you ever take up these couples on their mat, officer, Mr. wildly inappropriate personal question, isn't it? Why would you answer that? Um, I ha, I have but not post show. Yeah. You got to meet up any good or do you get sort of caught up in the social dynamics? I think if I think, I wouldn't mind if it was three individuals who just met my favorite days because with a couple they've got their own thing.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       They keep telling each other. They love each other throughout. Oh yeah. Newer on the age. Nobody loves me once as a younger man in freer and more liberal type day from love. Share your beautiful say that. Uh, like I, I was sleeping with two humans and them to humans really liked each other more than me, but I just thought it was nice that they found each other via me. If they weren't, they were very happy together. So it was quite amazing because it crossed over from carnality and it was the thing that sort of interests me about sex. Actually. I've never been an overt mechanized ca conventionally mail person. It's actually, I do enjoy the opportunity tunity for a kind of transcendent union that can occur that there is even in the most promiscuous in fleeting encounter as a kind of thing that feels like love very much and it can't be sustained in a relationship, but you're not asking it to do that if you're just banding about the hybrid.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       I'm banding about. I agree though. I think, um, those. I mean, you're just getting a hit of those hormones. That's the same feeling of just as A. Yeah, temporary. Yeah, that's right. I sort of want said like the, uh, well, why is longevity? The key component? You can fall in love with someone just in a moment and that's enough. In fact, George Orwell writes, and I quote this a lot, it's on the first page of homage to Catalonia, one of the few pages of homage to Catalonia that read it goes like he's in line to sign up for Poom or some anarchist group to fight in the Spanish civil war. And the bloke in front of him was this Italian gazer with ginger beer. And he said he loved him and he knew that he could love him, like just in that moment and he's never sort of saw him again because there's something about the man that was very, very beautiful and you know, these sort of senses of solidarity that can occur in crisis.

Speaker 1:          00:47:53       This thing that we are looking for is connection. Definitely. I think. Wouldn't it be nice if, because I hate breakups. I hate it. I don't know why we do it, but I think I'm imagining if there was a two week time limit, so you meet someone, you fall in love but you both go microchip or something. But if you after her weight, I haven't thought it through as much. I'm done with this. It make someone two weeks months, two weeks haven't like euphoric and then you both know after two weeks you got to never see each other again. This is all good. It's good because it prevents any attachment. Yeah. I don't know to be heartbreaking if I got two weeks. The one thing about like marital life or not one but one thing. One of the many things we might listen to this, she won't, she don't care about my career, one of the many things just in case one of the many things that I like about my old life is the sense and I had it this morning when I got out of bed.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       It's like, oh please God, be going to bed with this person again tonight and I don't have to worry no more and hopefully this life will be a continuation of going to bed with this person and then one of us will die. That's terrible. At the end. Will building in your version yams in a fortnight too much, too quick. I know you're right. I mean my, my parents are. I'm madly in love. They'd been together. Yeah, it's, it's crazy. Having that model of monogamy there, there. I mean crazy. Like talk about their sex life all the time and just you can just see it there. Hang on each other's words. It's crazy. So I guess that can happen. Also, it's given you, it seems like you've been developed in a crucible where you've been able to embrace yourself outside of what was formerly known as convention.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       Now what about this book you're writing? That sounds quite fascinating. Tell me a bit more about that. Well, that's tricky. How do you, how do you do it? How do you hit deadlines and be disciplined about it? So tricky. I'm trying to write it now because it was a day. What's the total 50,000 words a day? You've got to make that commitment, but it might be hard for you to do it while you're on tour, but it flows out of you. I'm like typing like this and uh, I um, yeah, but it'll be good. It's the, the idea is to write the book that you, that I wish I had when I was 14. Brilliant about sexuality. It's a sort of fluid sexuality and so cool. And then how's it going to work? So I don't know. Oh, I had to write it. You're not the pragmatic.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       What is this? What did you wish you had when you were 14 year old? You? Um, well I guess I had a unique experience that my parents were amazing, but it's, um, it's a combination of pr, embarrassing personal anecdotes about sexuality, want to do and embarrassing anecdote to one to one do an embarrassing anecdotes. I mean, I think I'm going to tell this story about my brother when he was a toddler. One underneath the. This is not embarrassing to me. So it's easy to volunteer people. We all heard about an article titled Under the Table And my dad was like a nudist. He's always naked and uh, has an enormous penis. My father and he is sitting there and my brother toddled under the table and bit that the tip of my dad's Dick. And um, my dad, I forget what the punchline of the story, fine one because of the story is your profit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       So if we don't find some conclusion, we're all left with the image I know to do with helping 14 year old come out with gender fluidity. Now so far what we've got massive willy little profit goes onto the Typo by showed that on the Willie and we've made the wrong choice with anecdotes asked for an embarrassing one. Well that was challenging. That was a challenge though. I think. What the. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the only dirt I have in my brother. He's lived the cleanest life and I remind them of it. So that's good to keep me with your property is just trying to get on with his life as a professional person. Here I am doing this. That on the tape. So that's before you start judging me for being at the vanguard of new identity politics and being a book geiling and Roger in this one.

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       The finger up on the stage, there's never forget that day were you bit down, but they all got new. Stopped bringing out when he says, Oh, I've never done anything with the guy. And I go, well, dad's massive deck and the emphasis of the size, which in a sense the story didn't need. No, I know you did that, which I think gave the story real sort of white. He never watches this here. Is it a brother or your dad? Either. We don't want anyone and that it was meant to be an embarrassing story about you may. Yeah. Where is that story? Um, I, uh, I talk about, um, I, my first boyfriend was called Ian Peach and uh, that was his real name and then um, we, he broke up with me and um, and then years later I was doing an interview and they said, why do you think you're gay?

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       Which is tricky question and I'll also just a lot of assumptions in that question, but I, yeah. And I just panicked and said, well, maybe nph. But they misquote him in. They heard maybe eating a peach and so it was a bizarre and they refuse to change it. They're like, that's what you said. No, he page. Look here, we're using the yearbook. Yeah, no, that doesn't make sense. I'll put page, but he in a page that was half, let's face it, powerful potent undertones, which seemed to have been present throughout much of this interview. And occasionally they spike into awareness in some ghoulish familial. The image of you in an ips bed. My mom has a google alert set up with my name, you know, anytime my name comes up, she gets an email, so then she got an email with that interview about eating a peach was I got this phone call like it's really how you feel as if we gave your brother the same peaches.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       I don't know what there was so stressed about it. And your father must be a man that's constantly on the precipice, worrying about the tip of his John Really off fall under the offspring, but yeah. Yeah. Extraordinary and magnificent person. You are. Let's make sure that we've covered everything that we need to cover. Right? You're writing that book. Can everyone please calm down? Right? Is that you're definitely going to call it. That one's not going to be out. I don't know if you've got other ideas. I'm coming out and calm down. Sounds quite good. Quite good. Might be too long, but I quite like it. I'm not very good at titles. Quite good. July comes out. Good. Brilliant. And also, you're on tour now and we should go to my mind.net to get our tickets when I'll come and see you. I'll come and see you somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       That'd be great. Maybe we're in the same place at the same time, right? I mean that'd be confusing for the audience. Be Very silly. That's the second joke. In an hour timeframe for a man calling himself a professional comedian, charging money. Zero jokes. But I've had a nice time. You're very beguiling and charming after a book signing recently, this person identifying as binary and I, we ran into each other in the park and we perched on a bench together and I said, explain this to me. Will you then as we're here. And they explained to me, well what it is is like I don't feel like I want to identify with either of those categories. I'm an actor and now we're going to go to this school and learned about acting. And I felt lucky. I felt sort of both old and young simultaneously as I reached across time to this person and they explained new grammar, new words, and I realized that the important thing, the thing that all of us have to learn is a kind of nonjudgment and a willingness to let go of our systems of categorization because not only are they impeding others, they're probably impeding ourselves and facilitating this bizarre tendency we have as human beings to cast our shadow outwards, whether that's as individuals or as whole societies.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       You see the role of many, many oppressed and persecuted groups being to bear the hedge monies, inability to look at it's wound, the inability or the power base of the United States to own its own wound or currently what we would term as Islamophobia or many of the things emerging from the various forms of identity politics. So it sort of. I can feel something shifting in my head that are kind of quite. Is it good? Yeah. That's so good. That's so exciting. Same though. Yeah, and it's changing all the time. It's. Yeah, it's. I think it's an exciting time. At least that's a positive thing we can. I mean I think a demonstrably positive thing that that these things are shifting and there's so much badness going on that's a really positive thing that people are changing their thoughts on labels and identity and I think that we're headed in the right direction then that's a pretty simple thing we can sort out as humans.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       You think like we could, should be able to do that overhead is making a lot of people a bit cross, but I think they're are going to be ultimately. All right, I've, I've, I think it will be very freeing and liberating for a lot of people that sort of come scrambling up to you after your show. Don't worry me. It's going to be all right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my mind. That's been a really, really wonderful interview. Let me make sure that I've done all my proper jobs, proper jobs, done proper jobs than Promo Promo Dad. There's no way my is bisexual. That's what made my thinks. We need to reframe the way we think about sexuality and refers to the Statler of scent to be 125. Don't identify as gay or straight. I like that because that for me seems like the evolution of consciousness, like young people coming through, they're smart and now our awakening, they're not gonna accept the old ways and the old old codes, brilliant friends in Canada who, I mean I guess they're straight like they've only ever been with the opposite sex but they're just not going to call myself that because what if I meet someone tomorrow and then I have to come out like that's stressful, so why not never say anything and then he never had the stress.

Speaker 1:          00:57:31       Do you know much about what's going on in affiliation with users? Is around sort of no platforming, particularly within academia within Canada. Do you know anything about that sort of stuff? Not really. I hear that phrase. What does that mean? It means like some people can't talk at colleges because I've said something in offense or something offensive often around identity politics, but I don't know much about it, but I know it's affected eg. Jermaine greer around gender identity and Pete attachable around lgb hold on a second. LGBTQ issues. So if you're my age, both of those people standard sort of great civil rights giants. So it's sort of interesting. Curious. But it's no reason why you have to be. They're gonna afford. I've no idea, but it is so interesting. Yeah. I don't know where. I don't know. It's tricky. Yeah. With freedom of speech and then also you don't.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       I'm in, you don't want to incite hatred and violence and stuff. So it's very. We're in, we're breaking new ground. I don't know if there is a right answer. I think we'll do. Why? Up to student bodies I guess to take to sort of discuss it amongst themselves and have a majority. I think you're right. I am a student. Did you know that? I go to. So as university I'm just a young student making me wait for it. I'm just lucky kid with a dream. I suppose my learning very little because I can't focus on that so as. And I'm doing religion and global politics and I think today or tomorrow I've got to go to a new module, which is the origins of Yoga in India. I think last year I was doing lots of stuff about, Gosh, secularism. The role of religion, rationality versus irrationality.

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       Beats for advent of protestantism in this. Oh my God. So much stuff. West fading tree in my mind is full of stuff. Michel Foucault. The brain's just brimming over with clap trap. So good though. It is good, isn't it? Toward Yourself. Up with the old bit of cleverness. Just in case you in an argument one day. Definitely reach into that little cupboard and knowledge. I love all that. I mean it's a whole other conversation, but I'm big into Joseph Campbell and stuff. So good, isn't it? I would. I'd like to go back to school. Maybe I could do that. Listen, you malleable kid. You're wondering around you wanting to move to the country. Your family members are fighting each other on my big frigging try to university to learn more about perennialism and myth, which I am also fascinated by because in a way we have to become the hero of our own lives.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       It's not actually about empirical evidence is about belief and faith and becoming a sort of a journey of becoming a becoming a hero in your own existence. We, I can certainly say that you seem to have been. It's been very difficult for me to not come over there and cut a little bit too hard because I'm planning to do first opportunity. Okay.
