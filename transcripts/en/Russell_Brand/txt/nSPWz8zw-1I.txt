Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Tony, how it is a professor of English at Warwick University and writes about performance in its social and political context. His book, women as hamlet include studies of the shifting relationship of Shakespeare, culture and gender in many societies an ideological situations. His work includes leading the multicultural Shakespeare project which focuses on the relationship between race and Shakespeare in modern Britain and on the achievement of black and Asian artists working on the place. Thanks for coming here, Tony. Thank you. We've worked together before, of course on a a week at the national theater where we took various shakespeare monologues and I try to, uh, use them to tell a psychological and biographical story, well, specifically an autobiographical story using the works of Shakespeare to talk about my own life. I was struck that in preparation for a, for this week of rehearsal and workshopping, you re-read Shakespeare in its entirety that's doing more work in preparation for that one event on Shakespeare than I'd ever done while I am paid to do that sort of thing as a university professor. I see. So it was no great hardship for you. Did you discover anything on and that rereading of the works of Shakespeare? Did you discover anything new?

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       What I did, the reason why I did it was because I knew that you were making a project about Shakespeare and I'd been given the headlines that you were interested in what Shakespeare might have to say about parenting and about addiction. And I instantly said, oh, well, parenting, that's perfect because Shakespeare in almost all of his plays, um, is showing you how not to be apparent. Okay, you can be a king, a, you could be a peasant, whatever it is, you will completely try to screw up your child and you'll have huge success at that. So that was no problem. But addiction I found more difficult because it didn't instantly jump out to me that Shakespeare writes about that sort of thing. Um, which I sort of had a had conceived as being a drug addiction or addiction to tobacco or something like that. And so I had to read through a whole lot of texts and in order to try and find out where that connection might be, um, but there's nothing more enjoyable than planning through the complete works of Shakespeare. So it was a great privilege

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       when you looked at addiction as analogist to obsession. Ha. That then surely it becomes completely different reading.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Yes. Yup. Because it took me some time to go to make that connection. Um, but there is a huge amount in shakespeare about obsession. I mean, um, I hope you don't mind if I sort of pepper this conversation with references to particular plays or performances,

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       difficult if we forbid it luminate people on Shakespeare, Shakespeare relevant as to modern audiences and how Shakespeare reflects the relationships, social, cultural relationships as they evolve and develop. I mean, what I'm fascinated by in particular is the way that you've studied how shakespeare relates to race, how shakespeare relates to gender because it seems to me that you see the work of Shakespeare as some sort of uber template for the human condition. So that's what I'm interested. So please don't mention the place and trying encourage to give you an obsession. I'm thinking about Richard the third. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       Um, there is a figure who is the kind of the dark shadow inside all of us. His only compulsion is to achieve power and to humiliate as many human beings in the process as he can. And, and the way shakespeare kind of shows that is to give him at the start of the play. I'm a pure wet through certain kinds of relationships. So what he does is he comes up to a woman called lady whose husband he's murdered and he woos her over a coffee and at the beginning of that she is full of anger and hatred. By the end of it, he's been successful in reducing her and it's kind of showing off what willpower can actually achieve if it's totally focused. So as a result of that, we know that he is going to be very successful. He's going to achieve anything. He wants his damn but over a dozen bodies at least.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       And in fact, he then Shakespeare then shocks us by having him stamp over the bodies of children because we can all say, okay, well we're kind of empathize with the trickster, the jester, even the devilish character, and we know that he's acting out sort of terrible impulses, which we feel, and we get to kind of have, uh, an ejection of pleasure from feeling we can criticize it, but we're also along there with him. But when it comes to killing children, which happens several times in Shakespeare, it's wrenching your guts and you were forced to decide how far I'm going to go along with this. What's very interesting is that then we find out that obsession isn't just about success. It's about self entrapment and destruction. So at the end of the play, Richard, the third, who is now the king and has to replay that seduction scene. He did.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       There's another woman who is the queen of England and she's got a daughter who he wants to marry him. So he has to go through the same thing. He says the same words has the same reactions, but this time he doesn't get the success he wants so that I think that's an example of the way that human behavior is taken into areas that we don't normally experienced by Shakespeare, but sooner or later will find that there are limits and we're trapped by who we are and even if you set out to break all the rules and to break every taboo to be obscene and you're going to destroy yourself in the process and it will be a very undramatic process.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       It seems from listening to Tony that Shakespeare is necessarily dealing in archetypes and energies that are always present in human psyche. I suppose that's an obvious point to make because otherwise Shakespeare wouldn't have been relevant at the time he was writing or relevant. Now when you take, just because it's come up, a character like Richard, the third who the archetype of the tyrant, the sort of a damaged malcontent and that for me that seems like an emblem and a figure that is relevant now. It seems like that this is a fractured and disrupted time. Maybe. It's always been like that. Maybe that's an observation people continually make. I'm referring of course specifically to a Donald Trump brexit times of malevolence severance and wrap chop. Do you, when you're relate into the contemporary world, use Shakespeare the same way that people might look at a religious texts like the Bible or Koran or whatever. And my God, these ideas are explored here because he is talking about the totality of a human being and all situations ultimately passed through the human psyche. I'm a waiver.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's, that's what I think Shakespeare has become. Um, you know, every country perhaps has a kind of cortext that's really important to it. Um, and in many cases that will be a religious text or philosophical text or a political creed. I think in many ways Shakespeare has become that for us and potentially for the English, you may offer it all English people. Um, I mean for English culture at its best, a shakespeare shows you how to live your life, which is that there is no dogma in Shakespeare. Okay? Um, some of his plays, which are the toilets with that for a second, he's an evil man and he's overthrown at the end by the first of the Tudor on it and Shakespeare is writing Chou Dynasty so you can see it as propaganda. Okay. Um, but actually the moment you start listening to the words that the new Judah kings speaks, you begin to doubt it. Um, we're lucky I think to have such a phenomenal dramatic text at the heart of our culture because that means that the writer is not imposing a perspective. His job is to be as complete and diverse as you possibly can. I suppose because he's function is to tell a story rather than to impose an ideology. But there is always a corollary between story

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       and character and between character essence. I remember when we spoke before you said that the Tempesta is in many ways the, I don't know, the denouement the completion of sort of, and this is it the completion of Shakespeare. So from, from reading that text and from obviously familiarity with all this work, would you maintain that there is not an ideology that there is not a dogma or I suppose there's a distinction between ideology and dogma?

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       Yeah, that the temperature is great from that point of view because it shows you that we all have inbuilt compulsions, one of which is that will to power. Okay, here's this wonderful magic island and we said this before, the moment you set foot on that island, you want to be. It's key. And as a result of that, you're prepared to kill somebody to achieve control over that potential utopia. Okay? And so utopia, which is in touch with magic, which is very important because it's, um, it's a political place, but also it's a spiritual place where anything is possible, where the mind can be free. But although we see that compulsion, we see others as well, we see that there's a parenting compulsion in that play. There's a, uh, the, the island is ruled by Prospero. The magician who has

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       correct there. Will you just tell me briefly the story, because a, I make a particular effort to make this podcast accessible to idiots. I mainly do it by being one, but I also do it by sometimes filling the gap. So in, uh, in the tempest of which there's been a very good film version made a character of Prospero is a shipwrecked on an island find and you've taken it from me.

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       He used to be a duke. Um, he's an intellectual and so he's a poor government in Italy. He's overthrown by his brother. He's cast ashore and with his daughter and, and, and finds his way to this magic island where he rules the spirits through the, in the, the, the, the keys to magic and science that he's found in his books by a peculiar chance. Um, the, uh, political, um, family, uh, enemies that he has find themselves cast on his island too. He conjures up a, uh, a storm, um, to shipwreck them. And then it's all about how, how committed to revenge he is going to be [inaudible], but in the process he also wants to marry his daughter off. So there's a whole load of political kind of stories running through it, but by stripping it down to a few isolated people on an isolated island in a magical see, it becomes archetypes.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       I think it was very deliberate because there's is a. There is a fusion of them. There are characters that are magical, like Ariel, there's Kaliban who sort of odd, some sort of a living piece of soil and the native priests of

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       colonialism as we would understand. It really is that. Isn't that right to say leave the colonialism for a second. I'm taking those two characters. There's this area who is a spirit and there's Kaliban who is a former slave. It says in the stage directions, but they show you how complex Shakespeare understands these archetypes are because the beast is part of the human. The angelic is part of the human too, and these pressures and impulses. They're at war with each other. And so getting back to your original point, which was about power and the tempest and the dogma that were finally given is you may have the greatest spirituality in the world. You may have the strongest access to magic, which is science we don't understand yet. You may have humiliated and hypnotized and conquered your enemy. That's what you do. Now in Shakespeare, you say, I'm giving it up.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       So there's this fantastic famous speech at the end of, of the, of the templates where Prospero says that everything must dissolve. Everything is like a play and everything is just atoms. And that seems to me that's the vision that's at the heart of Shakespeare because however solid you are, however real, the little stage or the little political, I'm a territory you control is when it comes down to it. What matters is the spiritual level, which you may see as religious or you may see as a matter of conscience or you may see a psychological, but you have to recognize that you are not who you think you are. And in a play, that can be the first step. What do you mean that you are not who you think you are?

Speaker 2:          00:13:58       Shakespeare tends to take the car, take his tragedies, um, there about ambition. Macbeth, a man who's a soldier and wants to become king. Um, it's about king lear, a man who at the end of his life is a king. Um, it may be a fellow. I'm an African who believes in love as the most important thing in the world. In those tragedies. What happens is that in some way, at some point, they're forced to understand that their, their passions and their human frailty destroy their self image. So a king must find himself a beggar. I'm someone who believes that the world is his to divide and rule or buckwheat, other people, that, that guy has got to become homeless. He's got to experience insanity. If he does that, then he's on a path towards big question mark. See, because it, Shakespeare is not. He's not telling you where to go. He's not telling you where you can be as a dramatist. He's holding the mirror up to nature. The famous phrase to the, um, the complexity of human behavior and the infinite fallibility of human judgment. And for that reason, um, he's offering you images of failure in order to make you think about alternatives in your own life. That

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       archetype or journey that you're describing, a figure or hero or anti hero with a self image who over the course of the story has that self image destroyed, seems read or learn of the early parts of the Siddhartha and religious stories where we are confronted with and and, and to draw upon what you were saying about the tempest. We're confronted with the futility of material pursuits were confronted with the futility of ideological or the frailty of ideological certainty that this experience will deliver us to impermanence. Do you think it's your academic awareness that the tempest is likely his final play and therefore the final speech in the tempest, which seems to be saying everything's just an illusion. Nothing's real. Things are temporarily held together. We're going to awaken from the dream into enlightenment without trying to give that a particular doctrinal. Ben, I, he, he don't give that over to Christianity.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       He doesn't give that over to monarchy. You said before, one of the things that you loved about Shakespeare was he seems not to be bound to any particular ideology that enabled him to play out the narrative of a young woman or a slave or a king or a murderer or a ct period, you know, like, and like it's so quite well known that historical and geographical accuracy is not what you go to these plays for. You go there for a deeper truth. Our certain ru, the, what Shakespeare was saying was we were with what Shakespeare was talking about to a degree. It made so much else was transcendence.

Speaker 2:          00:17:20       Well, we said like Shakespeare, right? The last plate, and it's called the templates as well. We know it's not the last thing he wrote because he didn't collaborate who does other people. But if you look, and this is where being an academic comes in and being able to read all the Shakespeare and get paid for it comes in. If you get hold of a big book, like the complete works of Shakespeare, which incidentally I got when my dad came home from a week at the TUC. Um, he was a trade unionist, but he'd sort of somehow gleam and the fact that I, I'm at school was sort of interested in, in, in plays, he went and bought me this complete works of Shakespeare and I sat down to read it. Um, and I remember reading King Lear while there was a football match on because it was a Wednesday, um, and I was astonished by the fact that there was so much of this guy's work and yet every single paragraph seemed to be kind of rich and challenging.

Speaker 2:          00:18:17       I don't think that's an ordinary reaction for a young boy with a football and in the background, I think you have a very particular relationship with that language, but that's possible. Um, but, but by reading so much of it, you do get a sense of an autobiographical journey or a biographical journey, which maybe isn't that conscious to begin with. He does seem to be a conventional writer of his time. He writes big plays about history. So to some extent he's latching onto the fact that it's a patriotic time. We, we've just beat the Spaniards. Um, there's a queen on board and things are looking quite okay, so let's, let's cherish her and let's boost the, the, um, the current ideology and the sense of national national wellbeing. Gradually, as you move through the end of the 15 nineties into the 16 hundreds, the queen's getting old, people are becoming more, more desperate about the future.

Speaker 2:          00:19:15       Um, that social change is happening, which involves the creation of a new landless comm class. There's terrible homelessness. Um, uh, at this time, no. Is there? Yup. Yup. Like, now, like now, like now there are people, good sturdy base beggars, 30 beggars, and if they come into your parish then your job is to whip them out the traditional English same as dealing with a social problem. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Social cleansing and, and that, that begins to come through until the place themselves. And so as the place become a richer and more complex psychologically, they're also more outreaching and awe and shocked, I think socially, well, when you get to the end of his career and he's only in his 40 [inaudible], so he's not that kind of ancient. Um, there's a religious element, a spiritual element, a mythical element which runs through a whole load of plays, uh, their names for those of you who've got your pens and papers out because we should be learning the pricklies symbolizing the winter's tale and the tempest.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       They all are mythical plays and they all deal with those ideas that you, you asked me about the beginning weeks ago, um, uh, about parenthood, but it's not the parenthood that, um, could be written up in a negative guidebook. Okay? If you read King Lear, then you know how not to bring up your children. Okay. Instead, they're about the mythical relationship between parents and children, and they're about the life journey, which every single person takes as an individual and every single person is there for tossed backwards and forwards by tempests flies between bliss and terror. But it's not a complete journey because you as an individual must find a partner. So love is part of the mythology and you as a couple must create the future. So parenting becomes the mythology. So there's a, there's a whole series of these mythical dramas which take place in a world which is partly real, partly familiar because it's about family, um, partly because it's political, it's about running countries, but it's also a psychological and mythical and finally spiritual.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       So it's not just in the tempest. Prospero is this Megan's character. Can someone named Megan. I'm Amigas is a man who has political power but also spiritual and intellectual knowledge. So it's a complete mess that you're aiming for. And prosper was a character who aims for that completeness but of really have it because nobody can. And so in those plays, there are glimpses of the divine literally divine where I'm in in the playpen. Berkeley's, which is a wonderful drama. Um, what happens? It tells the life story. There's a guy called [inaudible] who is a prince of tire, um, who at the beginning of the play encounters sexuality. Um, he's um, presented as a folk tale character who must answer a riddle in order to love and when a beautiful princess while he does that, but he discovers that the riddle is, that the, um, the father king antiochus is actually abusing his daughter and making her live in an incestuous relationship with her father.

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       Merkley's is so shattered by that. He said he runs away. He doesn't do what you're supposed to do. He doesn't confront the issue and he goes into a sort of reclusive, semi coma as he travels around the country and around the sea. I'm from town to town encountering new groups of people and until finally, um, finding the first half of the plate and it happens all over again. This repetition because we're talking about repetition is obsession because repetition is learning here. So again, he finds himself in a situation where there was a beautiful princess and this time he has to compete in sort of, um, uh, attorney [inaudible] I'm a has to defeat other champions physically in order to win her hand. What he wins her hand, they marry, they create a baby. And then there's a tempest and she and we're halfway through the play.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       Oh, plot here. That's the midpoint. Yeah. And again, he goes into a coma this time he literally will not speak. And for 12, 16 years, he just becomes a kind of a very rich maritime tramp. Oh, that old chestnut. The rich maritime trend. Yes. And He is told that his daughter is dead. The daughter was given to some other people to bring up. Well, it turns out that this is late Shakespeare and without you really understanding at what point it happened, but maybe it was the point of the tempest when nature seemed to be so opposed to everything human and when we were least able to achieve anything in our lives. And there's no point being clever, I can answer a riddle. There's no point being brave. I can beat a guy in a, in a Cheveria competition. And when the storm comes, you're done for.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       And even that perfect dream of, of love and a child being born will be devastated. Well, that's only half the story. The sea is about tempests, but the sea is about currents and currents. Drive you apart and bring you back. So the end of that play will be when it turns out that nobody who is dead is dead. The, the, the wife is alive and the daughter is alive and they all discover each other again. And when they do, there's the most amazing thing. The music of the severes happens because you're all, you're always thinking with Shakespeare, there's some sort of mythical or current or shape to these, this drama, but it's so full of detail that you can't really see what it is. But in these last place, and especially in Paris, please, you do. And um, the, the old man discovers that his daughter is alive. The daughter discovers that her father is alive and they suddenly hear the music of the spheres. And it's one of Shakespeare's greatest moments because we in the audience can't hear it. The people around these two suffering individuals can't hear it. Only they can

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       because they've been on a journey. And the rest of us haven't exactly. So later in his career it was, you're talking about divinity. And he began their story with grant glimpses of the divine in you say that there's an argument that over the course of his career as a writer or a philosopher or however we turned him, he is gradually distilling these ideas. There's a, a clarity is beginning to emerge. It, it seems to me evidence that what's powerful is that he is fueled by an understanding of metaphysics. Something that's very, very difficult to convey, but the, the, the material world, the narrative itself that which is evident can only tell us so much that we can't, through materialism and through rationalism achieve contentment of perfection or completion. Like you said, with that perfectly story. The first triumph leads to a period of unconsciousness coma. The second period of the second trial leads to unconsciousness. And it's only through s forces which cannot be contained or controlled. Also through active innocence

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       lifted out of my story is that, um, uh, the little daughter she grows up, she finds herself confronted with sexuality too. She's kidnapped and put in a brothel. But because Shakespeare is always potentially tragic, potentially comic, she's in this ghastly tragic situation. Um, it would be beyond tragedies, it's too obscene to be tragic, but she charms everybody by playing music converts everybody who goes to the brothel into being chased, which is a very funny scene. It's presented as, as, as a committee and because of her active embrace of the finest elements in life, and that image of music is always sort of symbolic. I think of that. Um, it enables her to go onto the ship where her psychotic father is waiting and she's the miracle. The turns, the key that wakes him up. Okay, that really badly. Um, but it, it's presenting you a picture of human, um, inadequacy, but there's always the possibility that if you dedicate yourself to purity of spirit and compassion for others, you can break through, break through and help others.

Speaker 1:          00:28:45       So that's quite a strong ideological perspective. That's quite sort of a religious idea, Tony. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       I mean, and it may be because like everybody, when they read Shakespeare, if they've read Shakespeare or just to see one play or read one poem, they, they think they know what Shakespeare is. And obviously I've been doing it for years, so I think I know what Shakespeare is, but I do actually believe that that's what you can see, you see, you see that journey and in those particular powerful plays, you find them acting out with increasing clarity and simplicity. And I mentioned the poems that I think anybody who would like to dash off after hearing this podcast and think, where can I, when I, can I, where can I find Shakespeare in neat form? I would say have a look at the poem called the Phoenix and the turtle. Um, it's one of his late lyrics. It's a purely abstract piece, purely metaphysical, metaphorical oncotype or about the marriage between a phoenix and a turtle dove.

Speaker 2:          00:29:47       And it's a statement about the fact that for Shakespeare, at least at certain times in his life, and it's the relationship between individuals through love, romantic love, marital love that breaks through. It's about the paradox of two, becoming one to be in one at the same time as they are two separate beings. And so the finish and the turtle is a beautiful piece of work. Um, it's very challenging in, in, in ways that kind of metaphysical, um, but it does give you that statement and that everybody is capable in their lives of achieving a miracle. And love is that miracle. That's really beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       Moving on, Tony, to Shakespeare and Shakespeare, I don't know, legacy I suppose because you've done a lot of work in a, I suppose decolonizing Shakespeare, should we say you've done a lot of work on like a Shakespeare in Gender Shakespeare and race. Tell us a bit about that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       Yeah. Well, I've, I've, uh, I've written this book called women as Hamlet, which is good. What I do is I look at performances, I look at people's detailed perception reception, um, how they channel Shakespeare in different cultures and times. And the women as hamlet book is about the way that, um, the historical gender assumptions of his time have been challenged from the moment that he wrote. So I picked on hamlet because hamlet is the greatest player in the world. That's in quotes, but it's true because it's about the growth of an individual personality or the things that we've been sort of talking about. Um, in terms of what you can see play by play a year by year, I'm in Shakespeare's development. You can see in hamlet as a play. It's about someone who begins by not wanting to exist. Um, hamlet's father has died. Um, we will soon learn that he's been murdered. I'm having it, doesn't know that. But as a result of that, and he said, oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt. He just wants to die himself. But he's dragged into life by the ghost of his father and step by step we see him undergoing transformations. Okay? Until the end he dies. And we would like to say because if it was any other playwright, we probably wouldn't be told what he has learned [inaudible] and through to me

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       be more explicit. Yeah. So Shakespeare's don't offend his audience with this is what this means because he's part of his genius, his workout, and your own consciousness.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       Exactly. Hamlet's last words are, the rest is silence. Okay. So we've all been waiting there for author's message, but there isn't one. I'm only the person who experiences complete obliteration, knows the whole story of life. And he's got nothing to say to us, unless you're in those later plays, you're going to move into this explicitly spiritual area. But in hamlet you don't. Anyway. Hamlet is a great, great play, um, but it's got to really feeble little roles for women and what our theater and got to eat a crap they. Yeah. Because they're not given much to do apart from say, Oh, hamlet and go mad and die.

Speaker 2:          00:33:12       That's right. Um, but within, within a very short time, women were playing hamlet. How, what do you mean? Short time? Um, the first hamlet that I could find played by a woman is in the late 17th century, 100 years. Then yeah, roughly roughly. Um, and that can only be possible because, um, after the restoration period in the latter half of the 17th century and women were allowed on stage, they weren't at all before that, but once they were allowed on stage, the paucity of the material that Shakespeare written for them in someplace became quite clear. Um, and so, um, it became quite common for women to take on the role of hamlet. And by the end of the 19th century, there were hundreds who'd done so, and we're not just talking about people in the, I'm a little gidding amateur dramatic society. We're talking about leading professional actresses around the world to come that part because they recognized that the things I was talking about just now, um, are so important.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       And I talked to a lot of actresses, um, when I put that book together and they said, people who played king, who played him Ophelia, or who played gertrude, the mother, they said, um, I really loved that play, but it was so frustrating being in it. I just wanted to speak those words. Several said that to me, I wanted to speak those words. They felt trapped in one tiny aspect of the geometry of that play. That's right. And so what's happened is that at particular points in history when there are major social changes that affect the way that gender operates in a society, um, almost like a canary in a cage. I'm an actress will say I want to play that part. I will play that out in now because there's is going on. Yeah, yeah, it's happening now. I'm maxine peake, maxine peake, and did it and just today they announced in the newspapers that you're going to be able to stream maximum peak performance of hamlet.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       And she did it in Manchester in the Manchester Exchange, a theater in the round just a couple of years ago. I'm in a where a lot of the roles were across campus too, so it wasn't just one actress making the big personal statement, which is really, really important in itself. It's a company which is saying we've got to embrace the feminine in these plays, but also politically, socially, we've got to give more opportunities for actresses to, um, to speak those words. So it, it's happening now. Um, and since I wrote the book, which comes years ago, um, I've been talking to people in Australia, I'm in Yugoslavia in America, were recently until years ago. They had the first black woman, hamlet on record. It's about having access to roles that give you agency, but they also do more than that and they allow you to alter the way audiences see the world. And you can, you can do that in any old play, um, but to do it in, in, um, in Shakespeare and ensures that people understand that you're challenging

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       old assumptions. I see. Because Shakespeare's like this open portal to the galaxy of what a human is. Brilliant. Yeah. You need to see black actors, female actors play these parts. Otherwise there is the hetero genius assumption that what a human is is a white man.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       That's right. So since you mentioned the, um, the, the race thing there, um, the, the big, big, big ton of archetype of figure was the great singer and actor, Paul Robeson. When is that? He was born at the end of the beginning of the 20th century. His father was an escaped slave. Bloody Hell. Okay. Um, we're that close to history. Um, and he, uh, his father was a, he was a reverend and ensured that Paul Young Pool had the best education possible. And as a result of that, he managed to get his into a black college. And then he got into a mixed race law school. Um, he was a huge success on the football field. He's the guy who first sang spirituals in the concert hall and made records, and he's most, most people know about him from the musical, showboat where he sang old man river. Um, and he was an actor as well. So many talents. It's an extraordinary, um, as a result of that, he was invited to London to play a fellow in 1930 with a, in the Savoy theater. He was allowed on stage to play Othello. He wasn't allowed in the restaurant.

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       You can't come to the after party for his own show. Absolutely. And in fact, um, some, uh, one critic walked out of the first night because some black people had actually been allowed to be members of the audience. I didn't come here to see black. Oh yeah, totally. And Paul Robeson was also politically very astute. So in fact, he made a point of telling the prime minister about this. Um, so it became a public issue on who was painting then that I do not know when, when are we talking about 19, 19, 30, 19, 30, easy enough to find out where using the Internet. But anyway, the point is that, um, he, yeah, he wasn't using the Internet because they didn't have in those days, but he was using the latest medium of radio, so a, around the first night, Paul Robeson, and because he was already so famous for many things, um, gave a broadcast to people in America explaining that the reason why he was playing othello in London was because he wouldn't be allowed to play it in New York.

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       Um, and if he were to be seen to be kissing a white actress playing Desdemona, his wife, I'm in New York, there would be severe trouble. So, and what he said attached to that was that a fellow who is this Morris African general who was working for the army of Venice in the 16th century but is regarded as basically sub human because it was an ethnicity. Um, he says that the situation that this character Othello has, which is going to end in death and disaster is victimized. I victimization. And the situation of a fellow destroyed in the 16th century in Italy is exactly the same as that of any person of color on the streets of America now, so 1930 number one Paul Robeson black actor is playing a part up until then played by white actors makeup, so he's claiming to have a real physical presence on the stage.

Speaker 2:          00:40:50       And number two, he's saying in the process that the plays that William Shakespeare wrote, all those hundreds of years ago in so far as they are true are true about the injustices of today and we're going to use these plays to make sure we're not just seen on the stage physically in the Savoy theater. We're going to be seen on the world stage and okay, you in America are not going to come, but you now know about it from the radio. He politicized that content and activated it is content that was there late and he was able to utilize. And I suppose that's brilliant activism as well as brilliant art and there's definitely a crossover. How do you see Shakespeare being

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       used in that way these days?

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       Well, to be focused purely on the, um, the um, race ethnicity aspect you mentioned right at the start and we've had a project, um, we're at university where I teach, which is called multicultural Shakespeare and it's a study of black and Asian performance since Paul Robeson's Day I'm working in Shakespeare. Um, and so we've got to get put together a big database of, uh, as many of those performances as we've managed to trace with as much information about the performance directors and other black and Asian artists who've been involved in it. And we put together the, um, the database. And I'm about two years ago we published the results which showed that number one. Um, and, and this was why I did it in the first place. There was a great history of people of color playing shakespeare in this country, which is hardly known. Number two, there's a glass ceiling I'm watching.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Two years ago we could say that there had not been a, a, a black hamlet in this country. Wow. Um, uh, they had not been a black Korea. Elena's pick a great role and you'll find that even though with um, with immigration, I'm going right back to the 19 forties in this country. Okay. Um, and with generations coming through and finding their way into new industries, isn't, isn't everything else. Although there was a big body of great talent, they weren't being given access to the really significant roles. I'm. The reason for doing this was that Shakespeare is the symbol of British culture that everyone can understand. And if you had, if you have access to that, then you have access to something at the core of our society. If you don't, then you don't have access.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Interesting. Shakespeare's deeply political then because you're continually pushing to ensure that access is given in that what Shakespeare represent and therefore what Britain represents or what power represents is challenged and altered in a and I suppose in a more equal and inclusive way. Yeah. Yeah. Why? Why? Why does it matter? Or why does it matter to you? Why this personal crusade when potentially you could be? Gosh, I suppose there's one way of dealing with Shakespeare that would be right. What does this play mean? What's the best performance of it? Was the best way of delivering that line? What females are there that you know, to a CSA? Is it not an abstraction to politicize it? Do you see that as a continuation of the content? It's the content is the content.

Speaker 2:          00:44:34       Can I read you a speech which I just happen to have brought with me please? Okay. Obviously I said a bit ago that what I do with Shakespeare or what I see Shakespeare as being about, um, is to some extent an accidental. It's me and um, the whole point about so many shakespeare plays is that they all say farewell to the audience at the end and the, the for applause. But they're saying, okay, we've had a show. We're all in a state of solidarity with the audience, but actually we're not the audience. The collective being we are lots of individuals and you will all see what you've just seen in a different way and you were thinking about it differently when you go home. So my view of Shakespeare is purely me and I'm Shakespeare is mediated mediated through the movies that you've seen or based on Shakespeare, like that excellent tempest or the production that you saw on, uh, on, on beamed down from the national theater and it's mediated through editors, um, editions.

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       Um, everybody gets in the way of Shakespeare. There is however one speech by Shakespeare written in his own hand, um, and that's a speak, which is in the British library. It's from a play that was never performed in his time and called Thomas [inaudible]. It's not a great statement by him because it's a play that he wrote in collaboration with lots of other people. Um, but miraculously one speech has survived in his handwriting is the only one. How do we know? Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you say that because that's your job to interrogate, tend to destroy a myths.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       And to some extent, we know that he wrote it because we know he was given the job of working on this particular script and through looking at his handwriting, at looking at the spelling, looking at the imagery, um, scholars have deduced that it must be him, but of course, um, that isn't in a bit of a circular argument because to say this is like Shakespeare, therefore Shakespeare must've written it is. We wouldn't hold up in a court of law, I think nowadays, but anyway, I'm pretty well 99 percent of Shakespeare scholars like me would agree that he wrote this great. And this is what it's about. Um, it's a, it's a play about Sir Thomas Moore, who was the, um, uh, I think chancellor, I'm in Henry the eighth day and there was a riot against immigrants and he was sent out to quell the right. And this is the speech which I would read out there. I think we better if you did. No, you did it. I'm going to show up. I need no encouragement. Okay. So this is Thomas Moore and he's addressing this, this group of, um, a xenophobic racist rioters in London.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       And then he goes on strangers, okay. That the, you know, do we call them, um, uh, refugees do because the migrants, um, the, the vocabulary you use will color the way people understand who they are. And in this case they're strangers you will put down, strangers killed them, cut their throats, possess their houses. Alas, alas, say saint. Now the king should banish you with what you go, what country by the nature of your error should give you harbor view to France or flanders to any German province, Spain or Portugal Ne. Anywhere that not ideas to England. Why you must need to be strangers. Would you be pleased to find a nation of such barbarous temper that breaking out in hideous violence would not afford you in a boat on earth, wet that it tested knives against your throat's spoon, you like dogs. And like as if that God owed not nor made, not you. What would you think to be used? Thus, this is the strangest case and this your mountain ish in humanity.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       So I might get struck out of the Shakespeare experts club for saying the fact that this was probably written by Shakespeare in his own handwriting and it's the only speech by Shakespeare that has survived in that form is irrelevant. But, um, it's an example of the way that, uh, a piece of text, a piece of writing, a piece of dramatic writing could be very controversial in its time. It was censored or not performed. Really? Yeah. Um, the, um, the, uh, the, the, the sensor. Mr Tilney wrote, leave out the insurrection holy and the cause there have and not otherwise, but your own perils. Yeah. So it didn't right in the center of that bit. That's encouraging gaps would be nice. Yeah. So maybe shakespeare just did that because someone said, oh, can you do this speech? And he said, I'm knocking off. All right. Um, or it may be that it was a speech he felt passionately about, but I think we have a right to feel passionately about it now.

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       And to say that I'm the one occasion when Shakespeare does appear to be. I'm speaking directly about society, about intolerance, about xenophobic tendencies, um, he's doing it in those terms which are so true to us now. And when you said right at the start, what did I mean when I said that Shakespeare encourages us to realize that we're not who we think they are. That's what this picture is about, is saying to the honest London citizens of the 16th century, okay, well put yourself in their shoes. Yes. And think what a disgusting life you will lead and hold up a mirror to yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       Anyway, this is the role of the Shaman is that Shakespeare can fall into the perspective of sort of almost anything and present so many views and in this case invites us to look at what we consider to be objective. Really true. I am English. That is alien. This is otherness. And the, the, the, those categories can continually shift. Just by moving to another place you aren't, you are now the stranger. The Stranger is you. Is Only circumstance. The temporal that present. She seemed to you to be objective. So if someone that has access to a multi valence can say, no, no, no, no, nothing is real, nothing is real, and it seems that that in the end becomes his conclusion. Now these evidently there is power in this writing because the, the time it was censored. And to touch again on what you said about is it poor ropes. And um, I, I know from the research that Gareth did with you that there's a story about the CIA attempting to censure like 500 years later, the, the, uh, Paul Robeson's, uh, experiences performing Shakespeare. Can you tell us about that place? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       Because like I said, everyone, um, uh, he wasn't content to do Shakespeare because it's a great play. Um, he did it because he saw it as a great role, um, for a black performer and beyond that he saw it as a great indictment of racial attitudes. This is 1930 and he's a newcomer to transcript theater. Um, and he's a stranger in the world of British classical drama, but he goes in there. Well, that's easy. He could have become the next Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King. And if he had a pretty good idea, it'll make sense in 20 years. Exactly, exactly. And in fact, when it came to it, Martin Luther King in the 50th didn't want to be in any way grouped with the name of Paul Robeson because Paul Robeson was also a socialist.

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       And being a socialist in the 19 thirties means that you are, um, antifascist it means you're pro Russian revolution. It means that your feet dirty, communist, according to the FBI in, in, in America. Um, and so they were very concerned to silence ropes and, um, it's the time of mccarthyism were ropes and actually appeared before the Mccarthy Committee and announced them as anti American as, as Americans. You don't ask them as only Americans. Um, extraordinary. Uh, his wife, by the way, did the same thing and she was brilliant to think that have enough bloody problems without going up against mccarthyism. Yeah, exactly. Um, and he was given many opportunities to, to narrow his focus, to shut up on the subjects that were so contentious, but he wouldn't, uh, so he was blacklisted. Um, and the irony is the authority on that list. So he couldn't perform in America.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       Um, all his recording contracts were abolished. Oh God. Um, but that's okay because he's an internationally celebrated international celebrity. He's also the black that is also the first black film star. He made great films. I'm in the 19 thirties, um, so we could easily come to another country like England or Wales or France and perform here. And so they took his passport away so he can't perform in America. He can't perform abroad. Um, and um, he found extraordinary ways of getting round that, um, he gave a concert, for instance, on the American side of the Canadian border to Canadians. He did that as an annual thing. Um, he used the new power of the, um, of the telephone that they, they'd later and Atlantic telephone cable in the fifties. And as a result of that, he was able to give concerts from his flat in New York and to some pancreas town hall.

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       And we did an exhibition about that and I displayed the phone bill. Oh, okay. How much? Well, there was a dispute over the phobia. They tried to make it so expensive you couldn't afford to do it, but trade unionists in London, um, uh, came up with the cash so it could happen. So, um, it's even the case, um, that some people, including me, would argue that, uh, ultimately at the end of the fifth is, um, the CIA decided that because these, um, conventional censorship techniques weren't working because he was determined to find ways of surmounting censorship. Um, for instance, uh, yes, he wasn't allowed to, um, to work with the, with the American record companies. So he founded his own company, a fellow records which published his records, his, uh, he carried his music, but also that people like Pete Seeger, um, people on, on the left, people who were going to be the, the is in 10 years, 20 years time.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       It's impossible to imagine that ever such a man that existed, but he did because of his bravery, his determination, his absolute commitment and his determination not to compromise. So anyway, um, finally, um, his passport was given back to him because it was ruled unconstitutional to take the person's passport away for political purposes. Um, so he left America at the end of the fifth years and came back to Europe, to Russia for instance, and in Russia his life changed. Um, he'd already performed a fellow here in England. It's rapid, uneven at the age of 60, and he'd already been in on the ground floor of the Notting Hill Carnival. Wow. He was a sponsor for the very first one. Um, he went to Moscow where he was hugely popular and was planning to go to Cuba when he was taken extremely ill and his son, Paul ribs and junior, um, believed that he was, um, experimented on by the CIA using you mind bending drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       Um, he was taken instantly ill, Paul Robeson, and he became profoundly mentally unwell for the rest of his life. He was physically destroyed because his mind and couldn't make his whole system work anymore. Anyway, his son in Moscow was in Paul Robeson's hotel room after he'd gone into hospital and he had this suicidal compulsion to throw himself out the window. So that convinced him that the CIA were behind the drugs. Um, so that can be same, that it was a drug induced psychosis and that the cio will behind it because we know that they have plans to do that sort of thing. Um, to um, uh, to Castro. Well, the clincher for me is that I'm Paul Robeson was about to go by air from Moscow to Cuba as part of his world tour and he was

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       time you might want to not go on a tour. They include, must go on tokenistic blow money.

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       Yeah, that's today that, that's why it's impossible to imagine that ever such a person existed, especially because he did not know, but the CIA probably did that when he got to Moscow. So when you got to Cuba, the Bay of Pigs, we scheduled etl. So I'm, I'm pretty convinced all the evidence has been redacted that we know about. Um, I, I spent six months going through FBI files that you can get on the Internet. Um, and it's quite clear that it says the health of Paul Robeson is an issue and then pages and pages of nothing but black. Um, so I'm convinced that the one thing they did not want would be that Paul Robeson, a fierce, ferocious critic of American foreign policy would be in Cuba when they invaded it and that, that would be the point at which censorship and oppressive, um, a behavior designer decides it's not enough.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       Shakespeare then has power in it. A great deal of power, I suppose it has. It's inconceivably varied well of human experience with recognizable themes that are seeing in many senses to talk about the futility of power in a way. The people that were persecuted in a pull ropes in would have done well to sort of read some of those plays and go out in a minute based system which are on a prop up is pointless. Look, it's all temporary. They should just let him off. Uh, so, um, in a way, how, how do you see this resource? We have this sort of almost, it's, I suppose it, I mean it's obviously a unique resource that we have a, I, I, an artistic work of such potency that is owned, I suppose by the English language, not necessarily by their englishness itself is like how do, how do you envisage it being utilized to continue the debate around power and how power is shared, what are, what do you see your obligations as, as a, as a, as a shakespeare expert. You called yourself that and you beat your chest as you said it. And uh, and uh, and how can other people also made invisible quotation marks in the air at the same time you did that year? There's a lot of weird things went on there for Mandy. So I'm interested in language Marcel Marceau across the table now. Um, how can we, how can those of us that are interested in power utilize shakespeare? What, what would you like

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       see happen? What you're going to do? The, the responsibility is to young people. Um, it's important that whether your, um, your, uh, South Asian kid in Leicester, um, whether your a kid with parents who came from Ghana, um, and you live in Glasgow, whether you're a kid in Poland, it's really important that these plays touch you directly when your views of life are being formulated. It's about getting to hear the stories and to see the stories acted out. It's about getting to speak the words. Okay. Um, that, that's really what it's about, the empowerment that comes through language. If, if Shakespeare had just given us the stories in the form that I've kind of paraphrased them, they would have been crap, but Shakespeare stood up, right? It's this bloke, right? And he's a bit worried about. So that's right. Yeah, that's exactly what I said and I'm really ashamed of it. And I hope you obliterate the tape. No, you've done a wonderful job of shakespeare.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       One one thing, for instance, when we've been talking to people with Asian family backgrounds about Shakespeare, um, uh, it's often said to me, and it's families were more than one languages spoken at home that really respond instantly. You're most richly to Shakespeare's language because if you, if you're language senses being stretched all the time and you're aware of how ample it can be, and so you aren't. I'm deterred by the weirdness, the opaqueness of the backwardness of Shakespeare's a written language. It's another possible way of looking at life, of, of expressing yourself. And so there's something very, very multicultural about the, the, the words themselves in that sense I say because they're abstract even from contemporary English speakers, so the levels yet, and it's so much poetry or shakespeare will always use an image if you can, rather than give you a prosaic sentence and imagery works on your imagination and in ways that you're not aware of and obviously that Shakespeare would never ever dreamt.

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       Um, but if you can give young people that, then it's, it's part of the weaponry that they need to get through being young. Um, and hopefully, um, it's part of their sense of potential identity. You see what you said, that in a way there's something of a shaman about Shakespeare. I actually do think that, but I would be thrown out of the Shakespeare experts club if I said that too many people and what it is restrictive in that club in it. It is, it is, you should see them God penguin suits, but he's an actor. Shakespeare is an actor and a playwright, and his job as an actor is to um, embody different people. His job as a playwright is to make the Panorama as complex and diverse as possible. So Shakespeare is one of those writers who, because he's a playwright, is always disagreed with themselves. Yeah. Um, and that's why we are so lucky to have him as our national board, um, as opposed to some great novelists like tolstoy who is ultimately bound to be dogmatic at some point because the narrator's voice will always interfere with the accuracy of what he's telling you, I say, but Shakespeare is never in that situation

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       because the form is about story and the story is populated by character and the character's must have opposition. So you must have multi valence. Whereas, yeah, in an narrative for a narrative forms such as the novel, as you say, the narrator has dominion, so you say it's important for people to inhabit these parts, to speak the words because it's kind of A. I said Alan Moore to say about like spells and language. That language will go work on you and when we did that week of we did a word a week of workshops with the National Theater and the brilliant director in Rickson where I've read different monologues in different scenes. It what I found is it's like a language is literally a code and the code in the hands of a master like Shakespeare and illuminated by an expert such as yourself and a director would bring into the in the that you.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       I felt like when doing Kaliban and prospero arguing about the change of their relationship since prosper. I've been on the island a while and like he wasn't not nice to caliber in anymore. I felt the adolescent may breathe back in a life with that sort of spurned sense of rage or when you work through the grace of hamlet, you are forced into unexamined corners of the mind, are forced to confront aspects of your consciousness. If the language for it doesn't exist, then the phenomena itself is perhaps doesn't ignored or it doesn't. If it's not illuminated, if there's no language for it or is it only the things that. There are words for being sad.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       That's so great. I'm like, take hamlet, need nearly all of hamlet's famous liquids which are so famous to be or not to be able to have it. And they nearly all. Um, if you go back to the earliest texts, begin with, oh, there's an exclamation mark. Okay. Um, how do you say, Oh, the only way you can do that is to actually capture that emotion. Whether you're on stage saying it or whether you're sitting at home reading it, it's a point of contact between you and that text [inaudible]. There's something which is not fully controlled and defined and limited.

Speaker 1:          01:07:59       That's pretty beautiful because it's not like, yeah, because if it starts with the word potato potatoes here I can and I know those, um, but like it is like it's an open sound exclamation and you've got to go work on yourself psychologically. It's a bit like a springboard,

Speaker 2:          01:08:17       uh, the bonds you, you know, you're going to be in the. I'm in the water. Okay. And you've got to swim in a certain way or else you'll sink. Um, but how do you get there? Oh, we'll take you there. So it's really saying as an actor, writing consumer can do this and we're saying collaborate, give me a bit of you and then I'll give you the words fucking

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       so you would not precious guy. That's what you like about him as well, isn't it? The Shakespeare is not precious. You said it's like robust. Okay. You can go. You can't be convinced, like being conservative with Shakespeare. Is that miss the point sort of go, oh no, Shakespeare has got to be some blonde bloke. I mean handle it rather it has got to be some blonde bloke. It's not like Christianity where eventually the iconic figure will morph into the convenient form to tell the story of who is powerful Shakespeare because of the diversity within the text, because of the conflict within the stories. Is that open to now we'll have a woman do it. No, we'll have someone from Poland do it and they will have, you know, like it's, it's a good way of illustrating what power is in how power behaves and built into it. Our invitations for you as an individual beyond how you, yourself are contextualized for your nationality or age or religion, your gender, find your essential humanity because that's another thing that is found fruit of the diversity of these texts is we all know what jealousy is. We all know obsession is we all know what loneliness is, heartbreak, abandonment, rejection, and those things supersede transcend, go around and flood our, the things we cling to the things we cling to in this store.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       Absolutely. Um, I think it's really great that he began, um, to be successful as a poet, writing the sonnets and so forth. But it's the plays that everyone thinks of because plays are public art and performance is a sharing process. And if you don't mind me embarrassing you when you were working on the National Theater Studio Project, um, and you did a performance, um, as you've described, um, the, the, the, the high point of it was the end when you gave that prospero speech, which is about the end of things to a member of the audience, a kid who was sitting there with his arms folded most of the time determined not to be impressed. The fact that you passed on the, the words and the speaking role to him was for me, totally brilliant and totally shakespearian because that's the point of it. It's, it's at handing on, um, it's a record well that, that, that, that, that last speech in the tempest is, um, a prospero says, um, if you from par as you from sins would pardoned, be let your indulgence set me free.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       <Unk>. So there's this character who can control the waves and the wind and meet in people's minds. You can hypnotize them with a charm. I'm, he's only an actor now and he is nothing and unless we in the audience choose to forgive his weakness, but why should we do that? Because we all need to have our weaknesses for given as you from sins would pardon me, give me a, give me some applause. So it's holding that mirror up to nature, which I could keep on going back to because it's such a wonderful image for and culture should do, um, hold the mirror at an angle and we see things in a way we are used to hold it up straight to our faces and we're forced to see ourselves and that may be reassuring. Um, but hopefully what's been spoken about, what's been acted out in a play like Shakespeare and tragedy. And it's forced us to look that much. It's forced it to it more closely.

Speaker 1:          01:12:33       That's beautiful. Yes. It presenting us with truth or as close to the truth. It is plausible for us ever to go with me our words as mere humans. Tony, that's a beautiful story. Thank you very much for sharing your experiences with Shakespeare. With us today. We learned more seeing how Shakespeare can be used as a tool for social activism as a vessel for history because they're it because of its the multifaceted nature of the work. There is a kind of alchemy there are spelled within it. Thank you very much for the education. Appreciate it.
