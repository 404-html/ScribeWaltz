Speaker 1:          00:00          This is a very special edition of under the skin because I'm not even hosting it. I am the guest this week under the skin will be hosted by the Great Welsh philosopher, the Dylan have a merchant new consciousness. It is Brad Evans. And what this man doesn't know about violence isn't worth knowing and I should are less rate myself and kick me own editing before I deny his knowledge of the subject of violence with the uh, with my book coming out, Brad has kindly agreed to interview me on the subject of recovery. Brad, I have my very much as a philosopher over the course of these, uh, of this excursion into the subcutaneous world. We've become friends and I'm very grateful for you doing this. I will now hand over full authority to you and bowers. I do. I'd like to begin by saying, I've obviously read an advanced copy of your book and it was actually a real privilege privilege to read it and I was actually taken by a lot of the courage that you put down on the pages.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So that to me is something to be deeply applauded. Now, the one thing I guess, you know, I'm also, I guess kind of humbled that yachty shall trust in me to do this. So, so thank you and thank you for our friendship. That's something with, you know, a cherishing. Um, I'd like to go, you know, directly into this question. As I say, it's kind of, you know, it's interesting being on the other side of this and the one thing that, which I kind of think about, you know, is that for anybody who writes a book, they know that it's a whole series of procrastination. Sometimes it takes months, often it takes years. And I guess the first thing that really struck me was what compelled you to write this book at this particular point in your life? I felt that anybody that's in recovery who has this experience where, what begins is something that you're using to tackle a particular addiction.

Speaker 1:          01:44          In my case, initially, crack and heroin becomes sort of over time. Like I realized that the tools and techniques I was using to one day at a time not used drugs and alcohol were becoming utilized in every area of my life. The way that I feel about sex, the way that I feel about food, all behavior and all forms of attachment can be tackled, or at least my perception of them can be ordered by working the 12 steps. So excuse me, coffee mate. But so what I felt was like this, I'm like at this point in my life where I feel like I've gone through so many layers of disillusionment, disillusionment with fame, disillusionment with Hollywood, this illusion when the sex and disillusionment is, I think by and large are bloody good thing. Who wants to be illusioned? You know, like so you know, and like, so I felt like, you know, the, the recovery is the lens through which I live my life is that my relationship is conducted through the program that I described in this book. Obviously my spiritual development, the way that I relate to other people, I by no means do it perfectly, but it is a technique that makes it so effective that I want you to expound it because I've seen it change lives of people with really serious chemical dependency, really serious behavioral problems. And I think it's a technique that offers is a kind of counterweight to the overriding, uh, ideology of our time, which just seems to me to be a kind of determined an icon and yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:15          conscious self centeredness. Yeah. I don't think, you know, when I was reading the manuscript and this call for transformation really comes through then you can see that as a very personal journey that you go on. Um, I guess I was trying to figure out, um, what type of book it actually was and I know this is bloody ironic or come from a song called postmodernist right there. I was trying to label it and classify it and I think, you know, in an affirmative way it's almost like an anti self help book. And I think what I of mean by this is I think the central message, which really jumps off the pages is that it's precisely these kinds of traits of a self centered, individualistic kind of fuck the world narrative and all, it's kind of loving sentiments, which kind of gets us into this fix in the first place. It's kind of just help yourself narrative. And I think what really to me comes out of this is more about a sober in perhaps more truthful cry for human connection. Is that where you see the hope?

Speaker 1:          04:08          Yes. Cause I think our culture and our biochemistry collude to create a kind of a chronic individualism. And I feel that the natural conclusion of uh, uh, kind of a secular rejection of the mystical leads us to the conclusion that we are just individuals. We're here to survive. We're here to fulfill our impulses. In the original 12 step literature, it says like, we have no argument with those people that say perhaps man's purpose is simply to fulfill these bike camp by a chemical drives to procreate, to survive, to dominate the selfish gene approach. But he says one thing we are certain of is no one has made a worse mess of this way of life than we'd at suffer from alcoholism and addiction. And like me, when I tried to live my life as a means to find personal fulfillment are getting into sort of a kind of peculiar despair, I start to feel lonely.

Speaker 1:          05:05          I start to feel disconnected. That don't mean I don't pick up the cudgel once again and try to find my way back to false prophet. Why I feel qualified to write a book on addiction. He's because I've been addicted to heroin. I've been addicted to crack. I've been addicted to fame, money, sex, relationships, other people's approval. I see this phenomena emerge again and again and I'm starting to think that the label of addiction in itself is too confining. That actually this is the human condition in motion. You're yearning itself, yearning and we live in a culture. I think that usually does is fuel this will to acquire a know like I thought it's become, the reason I wrote the book is because it seems to me that simple though. This is an particular though is in origin. It entailed within, it are tools that could people's perspective in quite a profound way and what you say there brad about it takes you from a point of view of going, Oh, if only I can get this when I get that, I'll be cool.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Or if that person understood me or if I could have sex with that person or if I could get those shoes. All of these part being personal examples from my own life, like everyone be okay and it doesn't work. But if I go like, you know, and I don't do it enough because I'm again, I every day I wake up, once again, bewitched and hypnotized by individual isn't. But when I'd go and spend time helping other people, sometimes in real blatant sub Princess Diana, why he's like going into a homeless shelter and getting proper hands on and being amongst it. Or if just on a basic communal way like we human being should be taking phone calls from other people that are suffering, reaching out and talking about their problems for a change, which you know is odd that it needed to be full made for me to understand it.

Speaker 1:          06:48          Cause I'm sure a lot of people just bloody do it naturally, but it just gives me a different way of talking to my mates if my mates are going through relationship struggles or personal struggles or work struggles, I think, oh why? Well, this is good cause I can connect to you here and while I'm talking to you, I won't be thinking about myself and my own problems. And the more I do it, you know, I think, you know, like in Christianity Brad had la, I want to know what you think about all this stuff, man. But when it talks about when Christ says it, get down with a poor, that's where he's at. And it's not like, oh my God, look at the scars and lesions and like there's some energy there when you're helping others and the Chi. And not only that, the other people that help others are beautiful. So you start to feel a kind of elevated sense of connection, purpose, meaning all of these words that are, I think being increasingly marginalized, empathy, all these things that are being excluded from the sort of political ideologies of our time and the social ideologies of our time suddenly become accessible fruit as most basic thing. Right?

Speaker 2:          07:45          Hmm. Yeah. There's an interesting point in terms of, you know, I think we can all kind of know in our lives when human connections seem deeply meaningful to us, right? And we know that these connections exist and we thrive on them. And we know that they're kind of really reciprocal because they're based on an ethical understanding and, and that idea of love with one another. But we often driven actually two relationships, which as you say, we're trying to seek affirmation in the wrong places and they become very toxic and they become, and sometimes society can actually promote those types of relationships, which we know what actually deeply, you know, detrimental to ourselves, to our emotional wellbeing, toward intellectual wellbeing. And yet we still strive for them. And even though we know they are completely empty, meaningless, or indeed maybe be nihilistic in terms of our own sense of self. And I think that's,

Speaker 1:          08:30          that'd be romanticism. You know, I'm not saying that we're at a, romanticism is a mendacious idea, but the, the, the notion that you can find fulfillment by being with some aspirational figure, some dietary, I'm living God as your own personal. Jesus, I'll find salvation if I find them. One, you know that that idea, I think he's highly prevalent but even more toxic than this I think is the commodification of relationships that that happens on quiet the, as I say, it's a collusion between bio, chemistry and culture. Like it's very natural I think on some level to meet a man and think, what can this man do for me? Can he serve me? Can he make me feel better? Can I make money? Is you're going to be a good ally in a fight? What can I do with it? Or in my case with women, do I want to have sexual intercourse with that woman?

Speaker 1:          09:15          Is this person gonna make me feel better? I was. If this is the commodification and the objectification, it happens. In my case it happened quite quite automatically. I have to work to not approach relationship in that way. So I wonder, so for me the program is the antidote to the type of thinking to which I have a tendency that's all it addiction is, is a tendency left on my own. I will go that way unless I intervene. Unless there is a program and the other thing breath, I think he's, it seems to me to be important is we don't choose between a program and no program. We have a program. You have the program of your family, you have the program of your society, you have the program of your culture, you have the program of consumerism. If you don't undo that program, if you do not be code yourself like someone leaving a cult, then that's the program you're living with the program of I'm not good enough.

Speaker 1:          10:04          I'll never be good enough unless I get this object or that object. I won't be good enough on this. That person can accept me. Now what I think this offers because it was designed to tackle alcoholism and addiction is a way of untangling the strands that web os to materialism, consumerism and objectification and individualism. All of these things that are based on the idea that what can be measured, what can be white is what is important. See like my um, it's not like I am anti atheist in any cognitive, you know, I know loads of people. There are a few is probably you like that are fantastic and incredibly smart and compassionate and wonderful people. My concern is that there's a thread within atheism that tells you that all the only thing that matters is that which can be ascertained and science in, in, in all of its main disciplines is forever peripheral forever on the brink of new discoveries.

Speaker 1:          10:52          And when you get someone like Elon Musk saying by like look with the kind of virtual reality technologies we have now, there's no way of proving that we're not all currently living in a virtual reality. And I had a gun, my mates virtual reality thing, my little mate Israel is only 11 years old and a four. Oh my God, you can be immersed now in a totally, totally different reality. So we elon musk sign, if we can do that, imagine what other cultures could conceivably do. You can't rule out the possibility that this is one. Well, bloody hell, that's what it says in the bag of our Gita, except it doesn't use the word computer. You know, like what is it that you want? You know, now we're saying it's the material world is an illusion that's like it's transmitted into your consciousness, through the senses.

Speaker 1:          11:35          You reconfigure it and you end and the inflections of your culture denote what meaning you attribute to the external stimuli and the only way of decoding that I think we're not the only way, but a way of decoding that is by impersonal set. In personal crisis, you get the opportunity to reevaluate that crisis could be divorce, it could be drug addiction, it could be a heartbreak or some other existential crisis. But when you're at that point, whether as an individual or as a society, you can say, is this the kind of life I want to believe that I want to live? Do I believe it could be different? Am I willing to accept help? Once you take those are the first three steps. Once you take those three steps, it's possible to have transformation. After that, there's a process of inventorying, a willingness to change, and then a devotion to conscious contact and to service, and then you've got a completely different way of life

Speaker 2:          12:22          in the world. Yeah. I think there's, you know, this reevaluation is, you know, it's, it's an I, it strikes me as a really important thing, but it's also a very difficult thing to start to reevaluate everything about your own sense of self, your sense of behavior. You know, it's often easier to project your troubles onto other people. Or are they, rather than actually saying, actually, is this something about my own self, which I needed to, you know, what, how am I shamefully compromising with power in a way that's affecting my own relationships with the way I'm objectifying things datafication and so on. But I wanted to bring us onto the, with the step that you said, you know, because I think when I was reading the book, the first kind of couple of chapters was kind of like, yeah, I can go with this. Right?

Speaker 2:          12:58          It's kind of, you know, there's, there's this step around, okay, admit you have a problem, then go and speak with somebody. Then you go into this section. No, what you need to do is write an inventory of all the things which really piss you off, right? And then I go, Whoa, wait a minute. Right? This is where it's starting to get challenging, right? And it's going to start to get difficult. And you, you even say those words at the beginning, he said, look, you know, this is not easy, right? This is difficult. And, and you talk about, you know, this, write down all those things which you think create a s and you're an assault on your sense of Salford, on your sense of dignity and you know, and the phrase you actually use you as the uncomfortable confrontations, right? So deal with this uncomfortable confrontations in your life. And I was wondering how did you actually feel, of course, from writing the book because in many senses you must have had to revisit a lot of uncomfortable confrontations, which you'd already might've kind of dealt with. But in writing the book there was almost like an attempt to kind of revisit those issues. And you know, how, how did you feel right in this book

Speaker 1:          13:56          because of the efficacy of the program, Brad, it did not feel like the resurrection of their cadavers of my past because they have been buried. And even in examine them, this metaphor is going well. And for the purposes, for the purpose of the book, like a, it didn't, they, they don't bring him back to life now. Like you know, sort of, I have a propensity to return to states of shame, you know, I like that I have that in me is easily triggered in me is easily triggered like leading up to my wedding. Like cause I think like is the way I sort of have been explaining this. You might like it, right? My Mate Matt Morgan, he said to me, keeps climbing up high. We went down crime up there. She'll fall on your head or smash open like an egg. Right. And ever since Matt said that a little boy, a cutlet and keeps going, oh no.

Speaker 1:          14:46          My head or smash like an egg. And Matt said the image is too lurid for the child about our handle it, you know, like it's too potent an image. Right. So me getting married, like I don't think, Oh, I'm getting married in the morning, like standing. The only way I think, well what is marriage? Marriage is a ceremony. This is a ritual. This is about the relinquishing of the ego. This is about coming together and making a vow to become a different man and to live in alignment with new principals. So on the causes that I'm looking at, what, what you know, inadvertently accidentally, we've not consciously, but somehow actually looking at what is the meaning of a marriage in juice is a state in me that's the point of ritual to induce a particular state. Meredith says, my friend Meredith, she goes, people think that religion is about the text.

Speaker 1:          15:29          It is about the ritual. It doesn't matter if you can't understand the Latin mass. Better to just hear a lot of babbling and something. What is this guy talking about? You know, like, which I'm sure some people identify with right now. Like you know, it's like the ritual induced the state in me. The fear was so terrible. The fear was so terrible, Brad, of what am I going to do? And I had to use this program to cope with the level of fear. I thought about getting married the next day. Not any fear about marrying my wife cause I really wanted and really wanted to. But something about that ritual, that ceremony, it meant something. It wasn't nothing. It wasn't, oh, it's a little bit of paper. So I turn up at Church and then a party. No, no, no, no, no. My friends, there is the unseen.

Speaker 1:          16:12          There is the invisible. There were, there is something happened to me and I had to surrender 100% I had to surrender. I said, what is this fear trying to tell me, what does the field one, the fear is communicate in the fear is talking to me from my own biochemistry, for my own body, from our own consciousness, a message, a powerful message is being said sin. And if I don't listen to it, something bad is gonna happen to me. I surrendered, I surrendered wholeheartedly. And every time I do that in my life improves. New States of consciousness are achieved through the surrendering of these biochemical circuits that somehow containers these neurological loops that we Lao to encircle us and tether us to low states of consciousness. I think you know. No, no, I'm those familiar. Yesterday on the bus, I'm taking the of this new state of consciousness and I, but I want to connect with, to

Speaker 2:          16:59          back to a question of philosophy because, um, you know, the trouble is with this bloody critical theories as we can't read any book without actually looking for the political and philosophical implications, right? Go on. So, you know, like, you know, I'll read Alice in wonderland, I go, this is the best bloody book of political theory ever written, right? But often we read books and actually most, a lot of them are just devoid of any significant philosophical significance or implications. In other words, they don't force you to think about a problem differently right. Now, the one thing which I admired about the book was it's, it's actually has a very deep political, philosophical, philosophical architecture to it. And the one thing which I was kind of struck with the book and what I was kind of excited when I was reading with his is when you talk about this attempt to connect about connection, you also link it to the question. Of course, you know, life is very fleeting, life is short and we need to find these connections and a meaningful existence. And I what the book really

Speaker 1:          17:50          kind of finds almost like a rescue in for me is an attempt to introduce something of the substantive over the superficial and the substantive for you is spiritual. And I was wondering how you can kind of maybe riff, you know, talk maybe a bit more about that, that you know, what is it about the spiritual that is substantive for you in terms of dealing precisely with maybe the philosophy of the book or is it a standard about the spiritual to me is its efficacy. It works when I do these things, I feel better when I am kind. When I'm loving, when I surrender, I feel better. Now these things can't be measured mack and mechanized or monetize, but they are in fact in fact effective. There is some truth in them that is difficult to legislate or iterate. So that's right. Works for me. And I think perhaps the reason that this program is so good is I didn't invent it.

Speaker 1:          18:40          It was invented or constructed by someone else, like you know, in the 19 for easy in America, a chronic alcoholic bill Wilson, who after like an incredible source of an epic drinking binge or the type which are defined his life, had what he described as an epiphany. And I believe epiphany to be the revelation of essence that previously concealed revelation of essence would want to feel this way. What's going on? Suddenly, you know why and bill was an has this epiphany and realize is that he will never be able to be free from drink and the problems that result from it unless he helps other people to not even realize he's one he can never drink again one day at a time too. He's going to have to help other people that have the same problem in order to achieve this state and set about it immediately.

Speaker 1:          19:28          First of all, traveling drunks in New York, going up to people in bars going, let me help you, let me help you. And then predictably saying, no, get off and leave me alone. Then eventually it has this sort of a program, uh, an experience which in the myth of the foundation of alcoholics anonymous is the significant moment, the defining moment in their conception, I suppose. Or He's in Akron, Ohio and it worry for a business appointment and it comes on him. He's in the hotel that he's staying at and he sees the bar and he hears the music and he's tempted to go in and, but adjacent to the entrance to the door is a public telephone. This is the 1930s, remember. And uh, he takes a chance and he rings up and he calls up a local priest and says, look, if you've got anyone or a doctor, maybe he calls like a, have you got any [inaudible] have you got anyone in this area that's been coming in going, I'm a terrible drunk, helped me help me.

Speaker 1:          20:20          And that guy goes, yeah, we are. He goes, can you put me in touch with that guy cause I need some serious help. Like I want to help him. And he goes, Oh yeah, this guy needs a few more phone calls here and there as they make the connection, but eventually ends up with Doctor Bob, the other founder of alcoholics anonymous goes around his eyes and he says to this guy, listen, I've got this problem. I, I'm unable to stop drinking once I start. It's ruining my life. I ruined on my relationships with my job. Opportunities fall apart. It's destroying me. It to him, he's condition. The other guy starts talking about his problems. The two of them having initially like the bird there, apparently the doctor Bob Guy was like, you know, I'm only going to tell him like he totally secretary, come get this guy off the 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          20:58          Okay. It seems a bit weird. I'm getting phone calls out of blue. When people want to talk about boots, they end up talking for hours and hours and hours. They recognize at the end of the four hours that neither of them would want it to drink during that whole time because the alcohol is not the problem. Alcohol is the solution to the problem of living under the false ideals. Of a materialistic society. People are looking for something. They're looking for connection. Some people just can't live without that connection, so they find another solution to living without the connection. Booze, drugs, sex, gambling, and I think we're all on the scale somewhere. All of us are one way or another trying to come up with it. They're very, like couple of days later, the two of them, they start going to hospitals, traveling other people. Oh, there in people here that are here because of alcohol related problems.

Speaker 1:          21:46          Yeah, that dude over in that bed, he's been a pain in the ass all night. You can hear him shouting from behind the curtain and that the two of them go over there, hit him up and suddenly, you know this, this is, you know, as you know, a lot more than me, Brad, within luckily historical terms, this is only the 1930s we're in 2017 now. This thing grows and grows and grows. People realize, oh my God, this works. It works. Now that it's written in the Christian language of the time is written in the patriarchal terminology of the time. It's also understandably protective of its identity. The anonymity is to make sure that Aa as a thing is protected and that no one person, certainly not me, can say, Oh, I'm Mr Aa because I know that I'm really still crazy. I could drink or take drugs tomorrow, send me captains and you know, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          22:34          I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm certainly, you know, as I've made clear in the book, it's not written from a position of authority. It's written from a position of experience and I don't know better than anybody. Like I don't know what crazy things I'm going to do. I just, but I know that if I work this program, I'll be all right. If I work this program, I'll be all right. The only problem stuff for me when I go, I think I'll take control of this situation and starting that cause me then ego, desire, pleasure, fear, rage. The other program steps back in. So the reason the spirit is important because it's the only thing that can transcend the material. It's the only thing that can house it. It is the crucible of the material world. What is consciousness? Where did it come from?

Speaker 1:          23:14          What the fucking hell is going on Brad? Like, and for me, this very simple tool, it gives us access to consciousness in a way that we will not attain if we live in accordance with our biochemical drives and a culture that uses it to turn us into passive consumers. Yeah, I think you can connect this to the politics of the times in terms of, you know, on the one hand, you know, we constantly told that nobody's in control, right? So we have to accept insecurity, vulnerability, and that can lead to a lot of people to be an anxious. But what York seemed to be saying is actually letting go of this very ridiculous idea that we can be in control of other people's behaviors, other people's lives,

Speaker 2:          23:46          like bloody North Korea this morning. If we dwell on these things, then we're going to live in the basically, you know, in this constant state of anxiety about things we can't possibly deal with. And I think that's kind of, and how do we seek some kind of affirmation out of this world. Maybe the turn, I just said it a different sense of the consciousness might be the alternative to that. But I want to come back to your story about you know, this question of confining. Cause the example you talk about, you know, these two guys were speaking and of course there they are confiding in one another and that idea of have to confide in one another. That of course requires confidence, right? To confide requires confidence. You need to have the confidence to confide in somebody and it might be a random stranger, but at least you have an established trust around this kind of sense of, you know, of the confidence.

Speaker 2:          24:28          And there's a particular passage I want to read from the book. Um, not only I think because it brought a tear to my eye and I don't to shut on your illusions people have of me. I do have emotions every now and again. It doesn't seem like it. I did an excerpt, the trues on suicide and you, it's like you're reading the side of a tin of beans. I know you're very emotional, but also because you know, I think it really addresses what's at stake here and this kind of, you know, it says, you know, suddenly my fraught and frighten childhood became reasonable and soothed. My mum was doing her best and so it was my bad. Yes, people have made mistakes, but that's what humans do and I am under no obligation to hoard these errors and allow them to clutter my perception of the present.

Speaker 2:          25:10          Yes, it is wrong that I was abused as a child, but there is no reason for me to relive it consciously or unconsciously in a way that I conduct my adult relationship, my perceptions of reality. Even my own memories are not objective or absolute. They are biased and they come be altered. Now this to me is a really powerful passage in the book because what you're talking about is not only can we sometimes you know, decide and we do have a choice around Utah. If you talk about the things that we hold and carry along with us, I'm not saying that we can ever forget them or we can outlive them, but we can choose whether they define our lives are not. I'm the fitbit central message, which I think comes out of this as a very positive message is if you do confined in others, that's where the transformative potential happens. You cannot simply trans wake up one day and say, I'm going to be an entirely new subjectivity. You know, it doesn't happen that way because in order to change your behavior, you need to change your behavior in the eyes of others, right? We are human, you know, we're not human beings, we're human becomings right. We'd always connecting to people in disconnecting and reconnecting and in that sense it requires a certain, you know, confidence to transform. I wondering what you think about it in terms of your experiences, Brad.

Speaker 1:          26:23          One of the things that recurs lately since Yanis Varoufakis it on this podcast was, you know, we exist in dialectic. What is of like, you know, seal me in a pod and shoot me into space. Like an, what am I, what am I without rf Jarvis cocker, put it more simply without people. We are nothing, you know, like so like yeah, quite right that it is a collective and communal activity. This book you could learn, you could read it on your own, you could do the program on your own, but primarily it's about how you relate to yourself and how you relate to other people. And uh, the passage that you read from a book, just to clarify, the abuse happened outside of my family and you're, the thing that I think is important about, um, you know, the, the my stance that you can, one can alter their perception of the past and if you will alter your perception of the past, you will to the present. Is that there? Yeah. As I said there, there is no objective reality, but you're right. This is going to be a state that's difficult to achieve. Just sat in the room. You go to Chondrocyte that to yourself. It has to be realized in relationship. I believe.

Speaker 2:          27:28          Yeah. Um, I want to connect this then now then to the social implications of the project that you've already talked about. You know, you see kind of addiction as something which is not just an individual pathology, but it's a social construct, right? We, you know, society gives you these certain values and those values in many ways play to the human desires in a way which lend themselves to addictive personalities. And actually we are taught to desire the very things which could bring us back down to it. You know, on our knees. And there's something about the tub log pressing Britain, which is kind of revealing of this, you know, we'd like nothing more than the celebrity who falls, right? Because it's almost like this, that's not the system failing. It's working all too well, right? Because we kind of expect us, right? We want this to kind of happen and you know, but I want to kind of connect it also to your other work on, and I think you know, some of the other powerful work and advocacy work you've done on the war on drugs and Lincoln, this question of addiction to drugs.

Speaker 2:          28:25          Now as we know, historically the war on drugs has been kind of separated between almost like a war legal paradigm versus a Health Development Paradigm. Now I think, you know, the shift towards seeing it as a health problem is a positive shift away from the wall paradigm. But too often when we shifted then to the health paradigm, it invariably retreats back into individual pathology, right? It's the person who's just simply a fault because you know, they've fallen through the cracks or whatever else. And I think what your book is also trying to do is add another layer onto this and say, yes, you know, addiction is a health problem. It's a mental health problem. But unless we understand the social consequences and the social effects which give rise to this problem and constantly feed it, then we will not gain a real tangible purchase on this. And you know, I wonder what your thoughts on this, cause this is to me is I find is really important in terms of really pushing the debate forward on addiction and the war on drugs more generally. And my question of violence and everything else which follows the criminalization of drugs is a useful social yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:29          In the management of populations. And this has been explored in films like 13th and the House I live in brilliant films on, uh, how the criminalization of drugs allows you to, uh, portions of the population, you know, form of Niekro politics, creating new economies, new opportunities for social management and social engineering, particularly in the United States economically requires slavery in some form to sustain itself. [inaudible] health model. You're right, that's it. I hadn't really thought of that, of that. The implications of a health model is a determinant means that individual pathology is the, is southernly the defining contribute to the condition. There is clearly a relationship like a young man Hari's written about addiction and he like the example he sites his rat park where you know rats that were kept in conditions like that. You know like cause it's interesting you'll love this is a a postmodernist dear brad that there's the assumption of what normal is in in laboratory conditions though they with unthinkingly uh, have this is normal and they put rats in cages and got a lot of these wraps.

Speaker 1:          30:45          They much prefer the water bottle that was full of crack cocaine, the normal water and then someone point out, oh no mate, it's probably horrible. Avoid that cage and sorry. All right let's give him a nice cage then we've all, you know, good shit to do. And they stopped taking crack curiously enough. So you know there is undoubtedly like addiction can affect anybody but particularly chemical dependency but it is certainly exacerbated by economic depravity. But there are different forms of depravity. Also emotional depravity is like, it's not a condition that the, the sort of the economically deprived people have exclusively control of hello be nice from turf exclusive and trolling or something. But it's effects are felt more there. If you can't get into treatment, if you can't afford to address it is more likely that you, you know, I mean you're criminalized from the get go.

Speaker 1:          31:38          You're already a criminal. So now is what degree of criminality is it that you're going to cop for? When I went to that, um, I went on a police raid in west London once and it was like, you know, it was, it was a very revelator re-experienced for me Brad. Cause like the bad the door in of what was a crack house. Like you know, even the term crack house once I've got like even me as a person that's been crack houses, I've never really sort of questioned the idea that that's, that's an Aos, it's not really a crack house. And you went here like we went in there and bought dwelt within the crack house was not monsters. It was like beating down the door of the leukemia ward, thin, emaciated, broken people slumped, Pale in a chair, denied sunlight of every variety, spiritual and literal just holding their lives together with drugs and that it's interestingly circular that this program on an individual level takes from self obsession and narcissism and deposits.

Speaker 1:          32:41          You are a point of service and kindness because that is precisely the program that's required on a social level that if we have an inclusive, empathetic, loving society that that necessarily you the these you include people, it would become a more inclusive society. I think this model of sacrifice that exists within Christianity, the, the, the, the sacrifice. God for me, I apply in my life when I ever I see suffering, I think that guy's homeless so I don't have to be a mate of mine. Got his leg amputated recently and he is a person who works this program. Like I met him at a sort of a conference for drug addicts, very badly organized and, and he was on crutches and like, Oh you white mate. I'd only met him once before, you know, it was a nice guy, but I didn't know him that well.

Speaker 1:          33:37          You're right. It's called Pete. Are you all right mate? He goes, Oh yeah, I go, what's with the crutches, you know, expecting are, you know, a trip to broke my ankle. Some sort of minor interest story. And he goes, Oh, I've got cancer. I'm having my leg amputated at the knee and I've fucking ill bloody. And he goes, no, no, no, I'm good. I want to live. I want to be clean. And I was sort of like some wave hit me of like the truth of what he was saying and the beauty cell four oh learn about this person. I'll call his number, stayed in touch with the week leading up to the amputation. He's fine the night before. The amputation is fine for at the amputation. I speak to them the next day. He's on a, on a bed, admittedly on opiates because of the nature of the pain medication.

Speaker 1:          34:15          It were blissfully happy and he continues to be because with this program, this is a program is effective. He transcends the material condition and just says, well, my leg is being amputated. I can't control that, but I can control my reaction to my leg being amputated and I think about this. I can't get it obviously out of my head. How was this guy managing this? How is he doing it? Because he's not putting it on and I'm talking to him every day or at Ross, some just doing this thing. Yeah, I'm doing of recording another thing today. So also he's happy and the reason is is because he's accepted it. He surrendered it. He's working this program and he's getting on with his life. He's not gone now. I will be defined by this problem and that's unbelievable. That's unbelievable to me, that is that powerful and it's that effective.

Speaker 1:          35:00          Now he does this again, as we say in communion, in conversations, so it works on an individual level, but you're quite right brad. It's not something that we should ascribe to individual pathology because where are these bloody boundaries? What do you mean an individual? We're all made of the same stuff. We're all thinking the same force rules, feeling the same feelings other than the variety provided by cultural inflection and social conditions were all basically basically the same. So like if we have systems that encourage empathy, if we have systems that emphasize the Corolla and connection between us, then we will build a better. So I think, yeah, and I want to push you on the, the title,

Speaker 2:          35:38          which is recovery. And I think, you know, you could offer almost like a simplistic reductive reading of the title, which is almost like, you know, how can you kind of go back to a previous better self? Right? So how do I recover myself? It's almost like the George Best question. I, where does it all go wrong in your life? Right? And then if you can pinpoint this, but as we go, as you see, you know, for a lot of people who are in this condition, it's the social forces, the complex social forces that is no pinpointable moment in somebody's life where you can say, this is kind of what it all goes wrong. But I think the way I understand in the way you're using the term recovery also is also a critique of the idea that we can live a perfectible life under. The, one of the striking things which comes out for me of this is kind of a humility with what you're talking about is, you know, on the one hand, not only not to take yourself too seriously, although we have, you know, we have to deal with serious issues in the world, but also this idea that it's okay not to be okay sometimes and to admit this is no bad thing.

Speaker 1:          36:38          That's true and this is something, again, I've only really found in, we've been spiritual conversations and spiritual, not not in the right word, but it's like for me, this has always been framed spiritually. Like when I talked to Sharon Salzberg on this podcast, she said that when you're meditating is normal, that you start thinking all the time. You don't punish yourself for that. You just returned to the mantra or return to the breath. You accept fallibility as part of the part of the equation of your humanity that you to a degree relinquish the idea of perfection but sort of somewhat paradoxically I suppose Brad, uh, the, the one of the meanings or implications of the term recovery is that you recover the person you're supposed to be supposed to be an info Commons I suppose, but meaning that I natural bio chemical entities that as a human being or a tree does have in it a code, it has an intention, it will grow a certain way if unimpeded by, in our case, social, cultural, personal, familial conditions. So what this, the point of recovery is, is to get you back onto that intended path. And it is my belief that the intended path is not to be a passive consumer. It just cooperates as an, as a unit within a, within a system of sales. Just as a statistic, we are engaged. We must re be reborn until the present so that we can become really what we are so that we can become what we are. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          38:08          did of rebirth. I'm going to kind of try to end then on a very positive note and go, and then at the start of the book you deal with the big impending d or The death question, right? So nothing more positive than death. Right? Um, and as you pointed out here, the introduction, the reality of death individually and yet it's certain, right, is something we don't like to talk about publicly. Um, and yet of course we know from Plato onwards there's this idea that to is effectively to lay it out, to die, I need to learn and to death might not be a physical death. It might be the death of a relationship or the death of, you know, an idea of the death of a person you once were. And you can kind of more than this, right? But I don't, however think this goes far enough and I think actually we might need to take it a stage further.

Speaker 2:          38:51          And there's a quote from David Bowie when he puts it, he says, religion is for people who fear how spirituality is for people who have been there. Now, I think with this in mind, I think the question your book kind of leaves me asking is how can we learn to examine our lives in a way in which may be, as you say, the addict, you know, has a certain experiential value, right? Because they have seen rock bottom, right? They can look at life almost the example you give of the people who are deprived of light, right? In this amazing created state, they know what it means to look at life from the perspective of death, right? The old must already dead, right? So I think, you know, in terms of then your hopes for the book, you know, and looking at the future, how can we learn and maybe take the voices of these people much more seriously in terms of if we appreciate we're all kind of knee deep in the mud, right? And we know existence is tragic, but we know existence is also wonderful. All right. So how can we maybe learn to go beyond this question of just simply learning how to die and look at life from the perspective of death and become much more affirmative of what we actually have in this all too fleeting existence?

Speaker 1:          40:05          Well, for me, Brad, it's become certain, quite simplistic attitude or north shifts such as acceptance, gratitude that I relinquish the idea that the, I'm not homeless in a Gob smacked up off my nut because I'm somehow superior, but just because of a sort of a random set of coordinates and events have deposited me in a comfortable life and I'm really, really lucky and gracious so I don't have a punitive attitude towards those people. And I see him in like, you know, sort of sometimes he'll write ourselves, but where I came as repositories, it potentially of great truves and um, important information. Uh, one of the recovery charities organizations that do work with it, Bac O'connor, they run facilities in Burton on trend in their United Kingdom and stoke on Trent in the middle and as those areas. And I went to an event with them the other day and like just spoke to that service users, which means in this case, drug addicts and stuff and like to talk through what they're doing in their program.

Speaker 1:          41:16          The counselors, a good number of the counselors themselves, people in recovery, which I think is always very, very helpful. And then afterwards, my wife was there and that sort of sat in there. They put on a lovely spread for us. God loves them. You know, some Christian, maybe something even as far flung as Bruschetta a, but the kind of Bruschetta would get in stoke on Trent. Yeah. Catch up. May have been involved. I manage, I can, it's perfectly nice. Anyway, there's this bloke there who was a proper to glance at like if you can imagine shaggy from the cartoons, Scooby Doo, but he slept outside for a year and he's had a bloody good kick in and no dental work. Like this is what this guy looked like, fin broken and uh, like drug addicts obviously. And I like, he's sort of, he's come lay and he's fin is fuck.

Speaker 1:          42:00          And he's like, ransacking the buffet quite gently, you know, just thinking of this food. Then I'll take that and sort of packing out and stuff and all goes, all right mate. And that goes, oh yeah, your urine. Yeah. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. And, and the like, because I'm like, when I'm among other people that have got addiction issues, I feel like I don't have the obligation to try and act like I know what I'm doing or that I'm clever or that I'm in control. And I said, sank too about feeling like, oh yeah, like I maybe mentioned fame in some capacity. And I go, yeah, but I do get like, get nervous and I get frightened. He goes, what'd you get it? And for you like your, you're Russell brand and like, who cares what other people think about, you know, if you would imagine there's people that know you if they don't know you're fucking right.

Speaker 1:          42:42          Now, obviously this is highly colloquial, but like, uh, also for me is sort of profound and beautiful and also the fact that he's even willing to take that role when meeting someone who's, they're sort of visiting in kind of like, I'm here as a patron of this organization, but that he, like, he's not like dumbfounded by the idea that I'm nervous and fearful. He accepts, Oh, this guy is just the same as me and there's an honor in that, you know, a real honor. And I think they've awakened people not only realize it but somehow can live it. I'm sort of realizing it, but the challenge is living in, you know, like that is, there is no distinction. There is no separation between him and me. We were all experiencing it. We're like, as the Great Bill Hicks said, we were all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. And when I realize I'm live, that I'm not on my own anymore, I'm not afraid anymore.

Speaker 1:          43:35          I don't have these obligations to prop up some Avatar of myself that people might love or approve of or boost up or make much off to ameliorate some inner sense of worthlessness. There is uh, the, the solve is in the wound, the salvage in the wound. You know, when someone punishingly says I'm worthless, I am nothing. Is it trying to reach the truth beneath that that we are essentially not divided, separate from and therefore are everything in the one. This is not about annihilation of the self as in the subjugation, you know, sort of refer to your work in a violent and destructive way. But the recognition that there is no need for fear and there is no disease need for desire because we are already one, we are already one and that these things are not just philosophical tropes or empty mantras. They are things you can live by recognizing that your own suffering can become a tool and the suffering of others can be an opportunity.

Speaker 1:          44:38          If you can just break out of the preexisting and imposed paradigm that you are here to earn money that you're worth is established by what you've got. You know, and like, oh Jason Segel the act, so I'm friends with him and he went all those things we defined ourselves by like, you know, maybe there's a billboard up with your face on it. It's just the symptoms of other people making money out of you. It's not you, not you. And all of that being flown around in a jet and fate it over like, cause that's not something to fear not doing. That's something too. We've escaped because, gosh, yes, it's a, in it's way, it's, there is glamour. They of course, glamour is a thing. People respond to it, pleasure and all of those things, but there's no real worth in it. Like I met that homeless guy once and let not, no, he was not homeless.

Speaker 1:          45:28          He was going to what? It was some homeless people. I met him in New Orleans and he was off to go and sort of help out or some homeless deal, you know, feeding homeless people. And he didn't recognize that was famous, that sweaty guy. And he said to me, um, a fame money, all of that. That's the crumbs I want to be at. The bank quit the bank, quit and somehow been tricked into finger near. That's what real religious people tell you that actually, you know, you'll get out of wine. I'm crack on. We it didn't, but this is not about subjugation. This is not about asset as Susan. This is not about denial. This is about finding the truth. And often the material world is preventing you from, from getting there, is preventing you from getting there. Cause we caught up and you want to mentation and we can't see that we're all part of one garment.

Speaker 1:          46:08          Yeah. So then to kind of sum up, the one thing which I've take really taken from the book, um, is being alone and loneliness is the greatest killer. It's it because not only does it result in people dying prematurely, but I can kill your sense of self esteem and dignity. And the two, I guess messages, which I wanted maybe just reiterate it for why take from the book is that if you are feeling alone, speak to someone or if you see in somebody who's lonely, just give them a helping hand because they probably need you more than you realize. And I think that to me is the one thing that I wanted didn't you know, to take from the book and is that how, you know, do you have any final comments on that or do you try to remind myself when I'm talking to people like about, I'm talking to another human being and I tried to talk to them with love and respect and often if the, if the opportunity is explicit, like you know, if it's, I'm dealing with someone that's got drug and alcohol problems or some other problem that I identify with, this is an opportunity to be loving.

Speaker 1:          47:09          I forget this all the time. I'm a pretty long distance from perfection. But like I tried to remember, you know like Oh God, you didn't really look at that person in the eyes. You didn't make it an attempt to connect with them, but we can come from a perspective of love. We don't need to only be coming from self preservation. We're not all here competing for resources. It's a yes was perhaps there's some evolutionary truth to that millennia ago, but it's not true now what are here to help one another and in deciding that we can create it all, it's a pleasure. As always, challenge to Russell and you know, thank you for the opportunity to get under the skin with you and turning the tables around. That was a bloody good wrap up Brad. Thank you so much for doing it. It's really lovely to talk to you. Obviously a very beautiful person and you're clever and what? It doesn't matter what I say. I could gotten such a long run in like where I'm referencing Zen Buddhism, Bloody Jack Kerouac consciousness itself, biochemistry and I could, it'd be good. Yup. Yup. Okay. I like your minds three seconds faster than mine, which I don't like incidentally. Thank you, Brad. Pleasure. This show was sponsored by my new book recovery.
