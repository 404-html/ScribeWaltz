Speaker 1:          00:00          One imagines that perhaps we have created through society for what is society butter pattern patterns that reward behaviors in patterns within us that are either negligent or detrimental or toxic or psychopathic. Do you think of many of the people that are in positions of power and the structures that surround them and the structures that they perpetuate, that these are the product of negative malevolent thinking and the kind of spiritual shift taking place on an individual level if significantly spread could bring about the kind of change that's required and indeed would be called revolution. Well, so when I look at it,

Speaker 2:          00:39          people who are in power, and it was interesting because I was listening to your podcast or Peterson and he and then he was kind of rationalizing the existence of hierarchies. And, but when I look at actually who forms the epics of the hierarchy in our society is largely traumatized people. Um, for example, if you believe you live in a horrible world, how are you going to be? You have to be aggressive, grandiose, paranoid, a selfish. In other words, you'd be the president of the United States because he's the one who said in so many words that the world is a horrible place, and that's the world he lives in. The Buddha said, 2,500 years ago, that was a miser, create the world, but my contention is that before the with our minds to create the world that will create some mines and trump's brain was formed in a family where he was demeaned and punished and attacked and humiliated by his father. And so he believes he lives in a horrible world. That's what he acts out. And his brother drank himself to death. So is this traumatized people now his opponent I could go into that was also traumatized,

Speaker 1:          01:50          right? So you're saying that in here, Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump, they were too traumatized people. Doumergue fighting to govern a traumatized world.

Speaker 2:          01:57          That's exactly what I'm saying. And, and, and, and, and Hillary's drama showed up in when she had pneumonia, she wouldn't even acknowledge it because as a child she'd been taught. She had to suck up her pain. She mustn't be vulnerable. She puts up with the philandering of her husband who is as much of a, uh, uh, explorative women is Donald Trump over, was just not as egregious about it. And then she's still justifies it. And so she, she, her messages to become inauthentic and suck it all up. And that's her form of trauma.

Speaker 1:          02:27          I can talk about British politics. Cool. I could talk about what did everyone. Now you're on a roll.

Speaker 2:          02:32          I could talk about this repressed person, uh, who was so in denial of own trauma that she's willing to traumatize the most vulnerable people in society. Her name was Margaret Thatcher.

Speaker 1:          02:43          What was head trauma? Do you think this. I'm enjoying this. So you sort of, a bit like in the Matrix when neo Nazis, everything's made out a numbers. You look at people and you see all their trauma and damage. See,

Speaker 2:          02:54          that's right. I saw in her a tremendous oppressed person. Um, I saw then you have a bland faced schoolboy who's willing to murder hundreds of thousands of people and never taken any responsibility for it. Uh, and it still doesn't deal with the impact of it. His name is Tony Blair, who's quite willing to go to a bomb drop son, drop bombs on, on, on Arabs for away, and they'll do it in, in, in, in the service of lies that if schools could see through and these are traumatized people. Otherwise they couldn't do it. They wouldn't be that split. And these are the people that our society rewards with power. Well, that's a sign of a traumatized society. That's my next book. It's good that asking to be a smash hit at one. Banging to that already. I got to write it first. You've done the hot book will come up with a concept.

Speaker 2:          03:51          The restaurants itself. Now what about the can we carry on with this game of. I'm marking off the powerful because I'm loving this. So what can we say like, uh, like Barack Obama. I'm like, there is a continuum. Obama. Obama is a fascinating case going. People talk about trump is destroying Obama. His legacy. I don't think so. Trump is Obama's legacy. Yes. I read his biography. He's a person that's very chameleon like he can, not deliberately and not even necessarily consciously a the identify with whoever, so so, so you can sound like a white man or you can sound like a black man depending on where he's at. So he appealed to both, but I think his biggest, his biggest sin was to have enrolled a lot of people in the possibility of transformation and change without delivering any of it. For the moment. Do you think that the inability of these individuals to manifest real change is a demonstration.

Speaker 2:          04:49          What we have are deeply entrenched and traumatized systems that are predicated on unconscious choices, unconscious drives and that the system cannot, will not alter itself from within itself, but will sustain itself and it's only sort of new radical ideas that can alter it well. Any system is designed in such a way as to make change impossible. That that's just the nature of any organization in the system so that. So that. So that doesn't matter what. Even if Obama came along fully committed to his agenda, which I believe on some level he was sincere book. That would have been a million reasons why the system and how the system would have prevented him from carrying an agenda, but let me ask you something.

Speaker 2:          05:36          Were assert something. Obama got into par, funded heavily by Wall Street is a street stupid or do they or do they know which side they're butter bread is buttered on. They knew what they were getting. They didn't buy into the whole pre changing kind of thing. Then you exactly what a what a fast style and inefficient servant of the status quo he would be and those students is again to power. Then your bills out Wall Street, he was transferred. He was responsible for one of the greatest transfers of wealth upwards in history and and and, and, and so the system you what they were getting. It's just that the rest of us, because we want to believe in the positive side of his persona because sucked in the system, never got sucked in by him.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Why this but wielded clinging to these narratives that have clearly been exposed is erroneous. Why now post trump do we. Why are we seeing from the liberal establishment and a sort of a nostalgia for something that was basically about 15 minutes ago rather than an acknowledgement and a recognition of the need for meaningful, significant change that addresses the problems of essentially the poor.

Speaker 2:          06:48          Well, when you look at the, um, mean you look at see American politics or economics, uh, Obama was as ready as anybody to kill people abroad. Um, he was as, as anybody to send troops overseas. Um, it's no different than American history has always been. Um, he was smoother about it. He was more urbane about it. He was a more articulate about it. He also knew how to speak to people's better sides. Along comes trump, he's agregious. He's a highly traumatized, utterly self unrestrained, a troubled schoolyard bully. And so it's offensive to the sensitivity, the sensibilities of the liberal establishment to have somebody like trump represent them. Yes. When it comes to genuine policy, there's no difference between these people. It's just that the system wants people who can make it more palatable and trump makes it very unpalatable. And so trump has woken us up, but it unfortunately, a lot of the liberal outreach has been a trump personally rather than at the policies, and rather than at the system that he represents no bursts or no better, in fact, you've represented more worse than, you know, uh, even a Bush or Clinton or Obama certainly can be much more effective in representing the system.

Speaker 2:          08:22          And trump is. And that's what Thompson is. Trump's son is not in what he does. Trump's son is in his personal egregious. I'm a in your face. This function.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Is it that trump is not an anomaly. Trump is revelation. Trump reveal sales.

Speaker 2:          08:40          That's exactly what trump does. And that's why they can't forgive him. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. That's right. That's that personally I see it, I think. And by the end, by the way I'm speaking of all of them are traumatized people. I'm an Obama was abandoned by his father and he idealize this father in his book, songs my father or, or, or I forget what the title of it was. Something quite sentimental songs but, but, but, but, but, but, but he was a traumatized person. And then his mother was a high troubled individual and he was going to buy his white grandparents. He, this guy suffered, but he's. He lacquered is suffering with this. But with this pattern of, of rationality.
