Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Commonly referred to as the rock star physicist has been described as the natural successor for BBC scientific programming by both David attenborough and Patrick Moore on by some as England's equivalent to Neil degrasse Tyson. That must feel good, does it if you're a scientist to be described in that way. Not by me, by David attenborough and I was there when he. When he said it, actually I was presenting him with an award. It was a radio times awards I think as I presented him with the, with the award and he stood up to the microphone and then said, if I had a torch, should I pass it to you? And then went and sat down again. And of course there's nothing you can say, and I've thought about it since the. The real answer is that the Columbia successor in the way that can't be a successor to Neil Armstrong because David attenborough was the.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       He invented the form really naturally be documentary was pioneered by him. So he's the first and still the best. If you watched blue planet two, that he's still making groundbreaking documentaries. So there will ever be another one that is 50 years of natural history, possibly what he's referring to in terms of succession is a sort of popularization and humanization. If it could be such word of data and information that can have previously been somewhat esoteric and inaccessible. And uh, I suppose that must be one aspect of your work that's difficult to quantify. Your personal charisma, your particular success. Is that something that you have as much impact on you psychologically? Well, I mean the first thing is humanization is a good word actually because I think that science is, I mean, what is it? It's, it's the study of nature. So. And it's, it's a humble pursuit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       It's about just looking at essentially small things and asking very simple questions. I'm a childlike questions now, why is the sky blue? Why is that leaf green? And one of those little points of light in the sky. And so the things we find out a demand I think demand the response there, especially when talking about cosmology, you know, we're talking about the size and scale and origin of the university theater return or questions. And so I think they demand the human response and that's the thing that I've always felt I've went out when I was little dude, dude, astronomy, which is looking up at the sky, the feelings that you get from looking at those points of light and understanding they were the worlds and understand how far they are away. And so on. Our, um, our deep and challenging feelings. I think people miss that a lot. People think of science as the thing you do in the lab with some batteries in school. You know that science is a switch, not questions about the origin of the universe itself. I think you're precisely correct that actually we don't spend enough time analyzing that feeling and to continue the

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       comparison between yourself and David out and borrow what one sense is, is that he has a deep love of the subject and it means something to him and he wants people to understand it. And that's what you've just described, is that when you are for you, the study of the cosmos is not about mathematics and relationships between physical phenomena. Abstract from the emotion, but very much as if somehow the experience of that emotion or the realization of that motion or suddenly the relationship between those emotions. Could you explain that a little bit of. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:29       right? Yeah. I think. I think that signed the act of doing science is an emotional response to nature and you said you see it with David attenborough. He loves life on earth. That living things he finds them fascinating, has a connection to them, understands that the idea that we are part of one unbroken chain of life, stretching back 4 billion years is a powerful idea. When I always think that you know when, when you look a blade of grass in the pavement, probably sticking up through the concrete, the, the history of life on earth is written into that thing. So the more, the more you understand them, the more you think about the things that you're looking at. The more powerful the experiences and the more challenging the thoughts are in that sentence. The, the fact that in order to understand the blade of grass, you have to understand the history of life on earth. Four billion year timescales, uh, those, those, those, I think a challenging ideas immediately and, and they're emotionally challenging ideas. So I think science is an emotional response to the universe because you become a scientist when you, you latch onto an idea like that. And so I want to know, I want to know what the origin of life was so I can understand the things that I see

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       today. So you see in the minutiae of life at the continuum of nature and that, that is, uh, through that aperture, the most profound questions conceivable, uh, we have to imagine answers to them.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       I think they all, all the roads of inquiry leads to profound ideas and not always actually to the statement we don't know. So we don't know yet if we ever will. Uh, how life began probably began on earth. You know, there are theories that it came the called Panspermia that he began somewhere else and then was brought here by cometry. Impact or asteroid is possible. It's unlikely though, but

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       sorry to interrupt you, but is there any significance to those theories? Just philosophically, I suppose that if life was at some point in his stellar or an eclectic that it interrupts the narrative of life beginning of on at this point is they are. They are profound philosophical implications. Is it relevant and is there any reason to believe it might be true? I think it doesn't matter so philosophically

Speaker 3:          00:05:52       because it had to begin someone because we know the universe was hot and 13 point 8 billion years ago, which is a thing we called the big bang and we know that they wouldn't have been any life around. Then we just the physical conditions with far too extreme, so life began somewhere and the way I like to look at it, it, it lets, lets say began on earth. It doesn't matter though. It could have be going to Mars or somewhere else, but the arguments the same. It means that geochemistry became biochemistry. So what happens somewhere most likely on earth is that a dead planet, but in planet with a hot core and volcanoes and those things, a chemical reactions happened in the oceans which changed from geology and geochemistry to biochemistry. And that's a profound thing. So it's. The planet did almost certainly gave birth to us, which is quite a nice age.

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       It's an ancient philosophical idea. Very Atlantic gave birth to us, but that's very light, light, guyer idea. I suppose that, yeah, that the mother earth in a very literal fantastic. It has to have certain. What about the, the distinction between a geo and bio, uh, a life. Why? Why is that so significant by one meter? By what metric are we understanding life if there was a meteorological system that can produce life, is that not in itself life? Well, yeah. So it's almost a semantic distinction in a way. I mean, you're right, it still just chemistry. And so when does Geo Chemistry become biochemistry? So the standard answer would be when molecules begin to self replicate. So that would be. So information can be passed from generation to generation. Once you've got that, then you have evolution, wow, and then you have live, so you've got to have some physical, chemical, chemical, some molecule that can reproduce itself and the inflammation in the structure of the molecule is passed on to the copy and once you've got that, I think you basically got life guys determined as biology.

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       We can see that as biochemistry, self-replicate in molecules prior to that. It can't be tracked or understood in that way. If you've. If you've got a system which can't pass information on, then you can't have evolution and if you can't have evolution, you can't get the life that we see today and it might. You can't even get single celled organisms because they are very complicated bits of chemistry and the key thing is how did chemistry gets so complicated and I think the key to that is that you get something that can pass information so you don't lose information. You add the information from generation to generation. Physical risks. This distinction between geological life, biological life seems contingent on its relationship with us as the observer and how we narrate that transition. As you said, it's almost a semantic distinction as it is in both forms. It is chemistry, is it not possible that our role as observer and the way that we narrate information is the true determinant as opposed

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       to the observable and obviously extremely significant fact that cells are now self replicating to us as observers. That's extremely significant but only pops to us as observers given in the great scope of 13 point 8 billion years. All this happening is some great, uh, Aria of creation. It's a really important point. I think it, you're talking about the value of consciousness in the universe, the value of civilizations, and we know of one place in the universe where there in Richard fineman words, atoms that can contemplate atoms. That's what we are now. And that to me is that we are the most valuable structures that we know of in the universe. Now, when I say that, sometimes people get very, you know, people are liable to say things. I owe human to damaging the planet and we're better off without them. This is nonsense, right? The point is, the most remarkable thing about our physical universe is that there are places where atoms can contemplate atoms at one place that we know of, and that might be.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       We might be quite rare. We don't know. We've looked a bit and we've seen no sign of anyone else. We we. It's called the great silence. Astronomers call it the great silence because we listened with radio telescopes and we look out into space, see no sign of any other civilizations and so it could be quite a lonely existence that we have here, but therefore very valuable indeed. Whilst I understand the necessity for science as the study of nature to be based on evidence, in fact indeed that is its essence. That is its modus operandi. That is what defines it does not the requirement that until there is evidence, we stay with the assumption that there isn't. Even though we don't know is parenthesized. Doesn't that lead to a sort of. Do you not think that somehow facilitates the dogmatic aspect of science, which has meant that it's sort of science has become somewhat doctrinaire and informative of areas beyond the humble study of nature and it's becoming fact, a kind of ideology that leads to materialism, rationalism and all of the other things that are on that particular evolutionary chain?

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       I, I, I hope not because it shouldn't, it shouldn't, but it sounds. I'm just talking about great scientists. I've just not been able to drink tea properly. Good professor. Don't put that in your nose if you're inhaling into your lungs. Know I've read about that because it's got to go straight down into the tummy, but I think there's and lemonade and made it a later point. I think the science itself, it is, it's, it's humble in the sense that it's about paying attention to small things and that's it. So you think about it. An example would be Einstein's theory of general relativity, which is the framework within which we do cosmology, which is the study of the universe. So these are grandiose aimed, you know, we talked about the origin and evolution of the universe. That's a big idea,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       but Einstein's theory of general relativity was conceived as a theory of gravity, which is a theory of how things move around in the vicinity of the earth. And that's it. So it's talking about if you throw a ball in the air, what happens to it now? It perhaps had the moon goes around the earth or the earth goes around the sun. It became a theory of the structure, the large scale structure of the universe afterwards. And I think that's really crucial. There are very few scientists who try to begin by saying, I am going to answer the great questions. I want the theory of everything. I want to understand the whole universe that is not the road to wisdom. Actually in science, the roadster, roadster, wisdom and knowledge. Well, knowledge first and then wisdom is by paying attention to small things. And then what we find.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       I think because the universe appears to be simple at its very basic level, there are laws of nature that seemed to be accessible to us when we seem to be able to understand and there are very few of them. Then virtually all road roads of inquiry lead you to, if you followed them to some depth to some, well the fundamental, but I wouldn't call them truth because we have to say that we don't have the full set of fundamental laws of nature. We certainly know that. So the laws that we have at the moment are incomplete now. Then they break down in certain situations. For example, Einstein's theory doesn't work at the center of a black hole or the origin of the universe. So we don't have the theoretical tools to talk about what happens right in the middle of a black hole, for example.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       So it was more the observation of a conditional pattern as opposed to an absolute truth because we don't know what's on the reverse side of that pattern. Is it, do you think it would be there? They could just be models. They are going to send models, which, uh, of the way that reality works. What about mask? I'm like, we're with the thing that you said about Oppenheimer, uh, earlier. I was very intrigued by Oppenheimer. You said that it was his discoveries that lead to, well, he ran the Manhattan project so, and he became haunted by it as many people. Did you know, he, I think he felt that the first bomb on Hiroshima was so horrific, but almost justifiable in the sense that it was a act to end the war. The second one on Nagasaki, I think he thought which gratuitous and he felt the power that scientists and engineers had given to politicians were so great that the politicians wouldn't be able to handle it, wouldn't be able to control it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       And he, he actually said in the 19 fifties that he was surprised that we were still here, as did many. Richard Feynman oil mentioned also worked on the Manhattan project and he said he was very surprised that we were here in the mid 19 fifties. He thought that we would not control this power and, but actually we have a remarkably up to so you know, what, 70 years after we got that power, we were still here, so we haven't used it again. Um, but I think that, yeah, that, that oftentimes felt that there are great lessons for the way that we run society in the approach, the scientific approach which was abide by analogy almost. So these ideas that I've spoke about already that we don't have absolute truth in science and we don't think we know anything for certain and we are humble with the way that we approach nature and crucially that our opinion counts for nothing in the face of nature.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       If we're, we can be shown to be wrong. And, and we should be delighted when we shown to be wrong because it means we've learned something and that's at the heart of the scientific and Debra and he felt those things could be translated from science to politics and the way that we run societies. And then if we do that, we would have the wisdom to control the power. This is a very beautiful ideology. Isn't it? And it's sort of not underwritten by, as you say. I like the idea of approaching nature with humility, with grace, with an understanding of our own limitations seems to me like a, a spiritual doctrine that should be used in precisely in politics, in domestic, familial life. This is sort of, for me, that is almost a universal idea that we approach nature up with love and compassion because obviously what I was very curious about what the one of the reasons I went to meet you for the respect you enormously.

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       I respect what you've done and the depth breadth of knowledge that you have and the way that you've conveyed it is awesome. But I know that as a man of science that you are. I said Sova famously atheistic. Is that right? No, no, I don't think so. I mean, I, first of all, I reject the label because I think that it's divisive and uh, so I genuinely think that science does not rule out the existence of a creator by, by definition, because we don't know how the universe began full stop. That's it. We don't know. Right? We have a theory of what might've happened before, the Big Bang theory called inflation, which says that the universe was still around but doing something else, but we still left with the question. How did that start? How did the universe have a beginning and if so, how did it begin?

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       The entries? We don't know. Full Stop. So you can't read it from a scientific perspective. It is wrong to say that science has anything to say at all about the, the, the, the, the nature of a, of a creator or the, the, the, the, the can be that because we don't know. That's all I say is that I don't personally have any faith. I'd have a personal faith. Now we can dig into that. Do you mean faith as in preexisting ideological structure that you use as a framework for your understanding of reality or do you mean faith as sort of an inward that there is beauty and great because when you said that humility and all that, that sounded like a faithful. Yeah, so, so I suppose it depends and you could talk about this more actually, how, what, how you define the word. I mean to me all, I mean when I say that is I don't have a religion that I adhere to. I don't, I do not know what the origin of the laws of nature is and, and that that's enough for me. Yeah. I don't really. I don't feel compelled. I, I'd love to know, but I don't feel compelled to go further than the statement that I don't know. And I think that's certainly one of my books. That's one of the greatest of mysteries. We are part of the greatest mysteries and for me that's enough. Yes, yes, yes. There's a very beautiful humility in that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       It's wonderful because what I was gonna say is that like that all I do have faith and if I, if I have to sort of unpack it and I'll move for us to continue our conversation. What I'm fascinated by perennialism and patterns that are found consistently throughout human mythologies. They're dislocated geographically that seemed to have universal themes and ideas and that I later discovered to have relationships that can, to some degree be described by science, by the language of science and their spirit of science, particularly as you describe it with such a, um, what would I say? Spirit of love egg for example. It was curious to me that oppenheimer as I understand and can remember I'm in dangerous territory and anytime I step towards science review and never cited to me like the [inaudible], I think he quoted the back of our gator at the point that the, um, the of those tests, those nuclear tests and indeed buddy, you know, attacks is it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       I am become death. The destroyer of worlds. Yeah. Yeah. And for me that there's something, what is that they're in like, you know, this is the thing I can't get my head around and this is gcse stuff. Is that campaign within the, as it was then the, you know, one of the smallest components of our physical reality with the capacity for such enormous destruction that there's inconceivable energy with health like that. I mean like that one there. The reason is I'm curious about it is because there are influences in religious scripture that seemed to be trying to describe that, that within the infantile and Somali small there is great power that there is limitless, that all things were endowed with consciousness. These are the sort of like when I approach religion, I don't sort of pick one particular book and God right on with these guys and and anyone who's not with it, I'd like to see them killed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       Luckily it's much more like, oh my God, they seem to be describing stuff without the language, without the language or the capacity. A very sort of somewhat trite example when dealing with her mind such as yours would be the, you know, the recent discovery of the benefits of mindfulness, mindfulness and meditation for Millennia have been spoken of as valuable for the human condition to have an access to an aspect of your own consciousness. That's precisely not about rationalism and materialism, but it's about access to perhaps the systems that very kindly run your kidneys for you and all of that. And so when that's discovered, demonstrable,

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       a, um, valuable, it becomes popularized or underwritten by dogma excellence at least, but there were communities and ideologies that knew that these technologies were powerful without the apparatus we had. And I think contained throughout scripture, people talking about oneness, unity, respect for nature, the nature of the soul, the nature of consciousness. And it's only from, for me, whether it's from a scientific background or religious background is only when it becomes doctrinal or people go, this is definitely the answer. Fuck you. That it becomes problematic. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, I mean, so I would say that I don't think the, I think the way to access, um, the way to build models about the way that nature works is to observe nature, right? Which is essentially the scientific method. You observed nature, you come up with some model, you test it, and if it doesn't agree with what you see, then it's wrong when you throw it away or you that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       So I suppose really if you think about the human condition for many thousands of years from the time when we first had such a thing, it's about, it's a responds to nature to everything about being human is about responding to nature. So I would be surprised if if people didn't in that, in those responses that they have, didn't, didn't observe things, patterns and discover things that you know you don't need. You don't need modern science to allow you to discover the. There's a regularity in the passage of the seasons, for example, because you see it. It's most of what it means to be human. So I'm not surprised that the. And also as you say, in terms of how to exist as as a, as a human being, than the scientists not going to tell you that actually it can tell you, well, it will be better review a little bit less fat, but it's not going to tell you about how to be content and happy.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       What would it does is I think provides a framework of. I'm not truth, I don't like the word truth, but I'm trying to get at because we can always. We can always discover things a different way, but it provides you a framework. For example, it says, well, the earth goes around the sun now and it tells us that there are a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Brilliant. That's one of 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe getting heavy now, but that's challenging, isn't it? But then what? What, what? What are we to make of that humility. Let listeners and and I think that's one of the most interesting things that we are. We discovered that we are at it physically and insignificant speck in the universe, so you can't argue with otherwise. There are 2 trillion galaxies in a bit we can see, but at the same time there's the idea that consciousness at contemplating atoms might be very rare and therefore we can be valuable and insignificant at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       And this is what Oppenheimer meant by what? In his lectures. I spoke about them not on the podcast actually running this show earlier that he talks about an idea called complementarity, which comes from. It came from the early quantum mechanics studies. People are Niels Bohr and others and it is actually, it comes from eastern philosophy. I think this idea that you have to hold mutually contradictory, apparently mutually contradictory ideas in your head. You have to in order to get a full picture of reality, and that's true in interpreting quantum mechanics and what he said is what you've already referred to is that people have known this for a long time, that you. You also have to do it to understand the human condition run society and it's a very good example of how science and deeper philosophical thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       Intersex. Yes. Yes. That's. That's fascinating and beautiful because I suppose what's implicit in that are quite fundamental ideas around objectivity and subjectivity. The inner and outer world and the way that they relate and the a is out out our tendency to regard that the world from, from an individualistic perspective, Po lead potentially to quite a lot of problems. One of the things I'm very curious about, and I know that your rationalism reason and what's demonstrable is hugely significant and important, but what fascinates me is that it seems that certainly in earlier times people were relating to their own consciousness in ways that somewhat define our rational understanding. People were having sort of yoga meditative trips and now people like you know, for ios going pio, interesting romantic plants that people have always used, have different experiences within consciousness that tackle this sort of ideas that you're saying science deals with now imperiously and rationally unnecessarily, but the fact that there might be other avenues to know.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       Again, I will be reluctant to use a word as absolute truth, but there are different avenues to understanding different avenues to incite fascinates me with the construction of mythologies. As you said, man is continually relating to his own environment, shaping, shaped by his environment. The basis of. Well, one of the bases I'm sure over evolution is that the way that we relate to external conditions and of course those conditions very and for political couches that were early adopters of agriculture, have myths that demonstrate that where God to sacrificed and put in the ground and hunt SSR is as tend to be more individualistic. They know the myths evolve to represent natural circumstance, demonstrable demonstratively, but what I'm interested in, one of the things I'm interested in, professor, is how can we use, as we've just touched upon with that idea that opened said that itself echoed a spiritual, how can we use what we learn in science to inform our societies in bloody difficult times politically and globally? What values can we extract?

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       I'll answer that and then going to go back to something you said we should vote. Routes to. Insight for thought was really interesting because the answer that question directly is that oftentime appointed. I said it'd be think about political philosophy, the way that we organize our society. So you might think that they're mutually contradictory axiom, so for example, one could be a freedom of the individual. If you're a libertarian, extreme libertarian, you think that individual freedom is the most important thing and you might be prepared to compromise a bit and build something in of have a society with. Ultimately you're talking about freedom as the base, the basis, whereas if you're on the, if you're a communist or further to the left, you might be thinking that society is all that matters and you might reluctantly build a bit of individual freedom in and will often.

Speaker 3:          00:27:40       Jaime was saying when this idea of complementarity is the two ideas of freedom and society are inextricably linked, they feed off each other. They are both necessary for deal. That's who exist, so you can't have freedom without a society and you can't have a society without freedom and it's just the idea that you don't start saying, Oh yeah, I'm a conservative. I am a Marxist, I am, or whatever. You have to understand that human society and its interaction with individualities very complicated and you need to. You need to understand. You need to be comfortable with holding those two ideas. We called them orthogonal in physics at right angles, the mutually contradictory ideas. I'm drawing, drawing a little as good, orthogonal 90 degrees to each other. You have to hold both of them in your head and be comfortable and understand that you need them both to get a full

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       sure thesis, antithesis, synthesis. There's another spiritual ideas

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       contradictory and you have to do it in, in understanding quantum mechanics, and that's the great thing because nature forces you to think like that, so it's no longer optional animas key point, yes, so you're trained, you're forced to think in that way, and that's very valuable.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Yes, but also say Brian, that the way that semantics and these systems of taxonomy actually operate is a word like freedom is determined by the powerful. So freedom ultimately becomes in where we can say in our society, freedom within limits, and ultimately freedom to consume, freedom to behave in accordance with these ideologies. This is what freedom means. When political figures talk about they hate our freedoms or they're attacking our freedoms, wha wha. What they mean by freedom is often indicated by the maxims they spout. When in crises, Eg go out and shop after nine slash 11 or there is no such thing as society from Margaret Thatcher. These like these sort of a momentary fishes with ever fruit, which we can glance what they mean. What is the state, what it, what is their truth? Because like we were discussing earlier in my summer intentionally to aft radio show. Um, the, um. Oh God, no, I forgot what I was saying there. Sometimes I'll come. I was operating on a level that was.

Speaker 3:          00:30:06       Wow. Well you said that you've given examples of people who are convinced that they are right now is the point. Yeah. Certainty. You said beware of people that are served and I think that, you know, we're really, if you think about what a free society is, that it means that there's a spectrum of viewpoints on every issue. And so you can imagine, I'd call it a distribution with the mathematics recall the tails of the distribution, which are the bits at the end. So most people might believe this stuff in the middle, but there are people on either side that believe other things. And if you have to, by definition in a free society, find yourself occasionally at odds with the majority. That is a signal that you live in a free society and you should celebrate it. And I think that the key lesson for me from, from just thinking rather more scientifically about things, is that is to understand that when you find yourselves in disagreement with other people, it is.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       It is a signal of a healthy democracy in a healthy society and you should celebrate every time you find you're an outlier. You should be waving a flag. You shouldn't be running down the street cheering going, I don't live in North Korea. That's what you should be. And that has been lost. You do live in North Korea. Which case don't run down the flag if you're listening to this, should not create. But I think we've lost that. You see on Yammer, we both, we're both on twitter and we see that the polarization of debates means that people are just not thinking. They're not stopping and thinking the fact that this person is saying something with which I disagree, signals to me that our societies healthy and the moment that nobody's saying things that I disagree with is the moment you should actually then you should leave the country and run.

Speaker 2:          00:31:48       Don't you think that what we're witnessing now is the time of foreclosure around discourse, that more and more things are becoming to booth, that there's a reemergence of censure and the Internet, as you just indicated, is a very good example of that. These are the things that are unsayable. Furthermore, don't you think that the art, we have to say that there are ideologies. Ideals are being said. There is such a thing as power. We're not living in a society that's constantly fluctuating and according to the will of the majority, were living in a democracy where the function of democracy is to limit the capacity of people to impact its objectives. And the one of the problems of globalization is that it has meant the establishment of a. they're not subject to sort of national, any kind of a regional law by. They seem to live in a kind of what I would say, a sort of a rarefied protected space

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       that and what you've seen with the brexit votes and I, I don't think it's the right route at all. I mean, I, I think I'm a great fan of the European Union. However, what you've seen with the brexit vote is extremely positive in the sense you're talking because what you've seen is a, a statement by the majority of people in the country that they reject the status quo. Sure. And I think they have done it. They have rejected the status quo. A prime minister resigned. There's now a absolute flux in politics and, and so I think that we.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       Brian, I think we have to note two things here. One, it's a massive anomaly. It doesn't happen very often. Stuff like brexit. That's why everyone's wearing themselves and all giggly and excited about that. Brexit in itself was an emotional reaction or rational reaction. People won't go more because I want to see these trade laws or emotions,

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       but it showed you that the status quo can be overturned in a democracy because at the moment we don't have this.

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       I would say within certain guidelines, I don't think, you know, when's the vote for now we're going to tax corporations at this rate. Now we're going to, oh, uh, this is how we want to pay mortgages. This is how we want our societies.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       You can argue that it may be that we see, for example, Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister, which would have been absolutely unthinkable and two years ago, and if he does become prime industry will be as a result of the brexit vote, that that will be the route that a more radical politician managed it. That's how a radical politician will have got into number 10. Now, I, I, I'm, I'm, I, I think brexit is a mistake because I think that it, that the people that voted to, uh, to challenge the status quo are going to suffer the most from this and the removal of the freedoms that we have to move around Europe. Europe, the removable of access to single market, I was thinking, so I think actually it's the wrong solution. Possibly, unless they are interested in democratically that it can. It can

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       still happen unless it does lead to a left wing government who use it as an opportunity to create new legislation around the behavior of transnational corporations, different taxation or something. Hey, you know there is. I was talking to someone in here recently about like a possible left wing outcome for Europe. I don't. We dragged down at bloody brexit quagmire when a man who understands the bleeding. I didn't plan to talk about that, but I think it's a good demonstration

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       what you're talking about it you could see as a healthy attack on the status quo. You could say, I don't think it'll have that result, but

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       no, I mean the fact that it's an anomaly is what concerns me and the fact that we lower the threshold of what's acceptable for democracy. We've got democracy once in a while. We can have a Miss God. Misguided carnival of disruption instead of democracy is why don't we control our communities and controlled so that the most vulnerable people have access to power. That's democracy. If it's not, that is not democracy is a piece of theater and like I don't settle for that. Do you remember like

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       because of you and I, we talked a little bit about because you were very keen to encourage young people to a point where I was saying it's pointless and like it was a sort of an intern because I, I sense that you and I have a lot more in common ideologically. Then we have the separation even though you are a scientist and I'm a religious maniac and you often pro democracy and I'm proud mass decentralization and disillusion of power where possible, you know, but I feel that we're both driven by the idea that we're essentially optimistic is what I would say about you. You seem like an optimistic man. Yeah, and you have to be. Because we go back to what we were talking about earlier about the value of this place, the earth and I think one of the. If I could, if there's one message that I would like people to take away from anything that I do is to is to value this place and it's.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       That's not some kind of like a sort of hippy type thing. Is it just based on the observation, the, the, the, the complexity of life on earth? It may well be. It may make us quite a unit. We can be unique in a galaxy, for example. I don't think. I'm sure there'll be other civilizations out there in the billions of galaxies in the universe, but it could be that the average is that there's about roughly one civilizations per galaxy at any one time, and imagine that Arthur c Clarke once famously said that there are two options. Either we are alone or we're not in both a terrifying, but I think we need to proceed on the basis that we are now an imagine. If people thought about that, which is just a matter of perspective. If people thought actually that if we decided to have a nuclear war tomorrow accidentally perhaps and destroyed intelligent life on the planets, it may be that we destroy meaning in the galaxy and meaning I use advisedly because if you think about it, meaning obviously exists in the universe because it means something to us, so there are collections of atoms that somehow of of the property of meaning as emerged.

Speaker 1:          00:37:42       It means something to us. If we go, then there will be no meaning in this corner of the university. Meaning is local and it's temporary and I think accepting that but by which I mean it it had in your head, but when I say I think it's global way though, in a way it's irrelevant whether there are other civilizations or this one's unique in empirically. I mean it's up to us. It doesn't matter. I like it. Even life is beautiful. Life is beautiful. Whether or not someone's over there having a beautiful time, to me sort of irrelevant and also terms such as local and ton portal, a highly subjective terms as we have already established that refer to patterns themselves that exist within a context and our consciousness relates only to that context, so the meaning that emerge. Is it like, you know, whatever this thing is that transition from online to live for various gradients, geological to biological, whatever proceeded and whatever follows that meaning is one of its components.

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       It's. It exists as organically as trees. Yeah. Well physicists are. Some scientists refer to as an emergent property which is something that emerges from some more fundamental structure and then this is probably the difference between us. I ask you a question because because I think that the great challenge of human existence is to come to terms with the fact that the meaning exists, but it is, as I said, it's local in the sense that it's not universal and I think that's the difference. If I was to define the difference between a religious person or a non religious, I would say that it's a question to you, but I would say that religion is searching for global meaning and I think it's local and I think there will come a time in the life of the universe when there is no meaning left because I think that as far as they were approaching it won't mean.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       I think that's what I think though. That's my truck. That's precisely the problem is that material materialism and rationalism lead to individualism, capitalism and consumerism. We can see in real time what it leads to politically and socially. I mean more brutal than that though. I mean the in the far future of the universe. There won't be any sons left shining, so there won't be any atoms that can contemplate at of course the universe. I understand that and that is an enormous thing to say, Brian and and I've got absolutely no bloody kit to argue with prince. What does it mean to you? You actually graduate. What does it. What do you feel like? If I say there will come a time in the future when there is no consciousness in the universe and so, so all possibility of meaning has gone, but the universe will still be there.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       I would say that within my philosophy, consciousness and matter have the reverse relationship too. In yours. I believe that emerges from consciousness, not vice versa, so even where the astrophysical context or in evolves. As you know, brilliant men such as yourself and your predecessors have demonstrated that will happen. That to me is essentially irrelevant because it's just part of the cosmic ballet. Continuing within the framework of consciousness, and I underwrite this of course, speculative lake, like all theories that are that bookend creation it speculative as anybody else's, but for me in the proceeding, the Big Bang there is consciousness consciousness that is not individualized consciousness. There's no expressed through matter and this is not something that I would narrativize or used to underwrite or support any particular ideology. It's not like in our consciousness for white people or a consciousness for Muslims, pure consciousness expressing itself through Mata and that these patterns and habits that are so beautifully delineated, these rules that discovered with these rules that Herman Melville describes as all human sciences, but passing fables as we discover what lies beyond them, like these are an expression of this consciousness, so when eventually whatever

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       it is that exist instead of human beings are consumed by the sun, that doesn't matter to me because individuation I believe is temporal. The I am just part of a whole consciousness temporarily occupying this individual or I can't put it any better than Bill Hicks. We are one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively and I would say that the reason that geology becomes biology is because the geology is conscious. That consciousness is in all things and the reason that we should love nature. I love the earth and love one another is because we are all one and there are motifs for this through our culture. Why are we moved by heroism? Because a person's sacrificing themselves for another why? Because they know inadvertent commerce on some deeper level that there is no distinction between self and other. This is mainly the greed of the senses, dealing with physical information.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       The experience are receives. This is inside, this is outside, but ultimately in essentially those distinctions are animalistic attempts to understand limitless phenomena. So that's why it doesn't matter to me. Although I would say like you, we have to regard these thing with love because love in a very Christian sense, actually let's. Cs Lewis says, you feel like you're rewarded when you do a good thing and when you do a bad thing, you know that was bad, so let's just go with that. Be kind to one another. Love one another. Let people believe what they want to believe. So mine comes from that. I'm not ashamed of the bits that sounded a bit hippy because for me love is an energy. Love is a force, and whilst it's difficult to quantify and measure without it, we are nothing. I think

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       the only thing, my view is it certainly bleaker, right? Pointing, well, but I think that actually the road see, I would say that the road to wisdom is is the most challenging question that I face given the I'm saying that matter and energy in the laws of nature exist and then life emerges from them and then they will come and sign when there's no life so that that challenges you to say what is the value then of life and given that it is temporary and this emerges and it will go away again and it will be time when the universe is dark and there is nothing left and I think that you get some sort of delight from what I did because I think in the sense that the the piece is a human being I think comes from finding your accommodation with your temporary existence and I'm learning that it's so. The temporary nature of it to me makes it more valuable is a fine as a tiny amount of time is nothing in the light of the universe. A tiny amount of time when we not only individually but as a human race can exist and explore and love the universe. It's a finite tiny amount of time and I think

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that's a much more difficult accommodation to come to it, but I think that's really. I think that's what reality is and so we've got to come to accommodation with, but I think in that accommodation is the way you learn to love the planets and the people on it because you learned that they are temporary and valuable and franchise. As long as it leads to that conclusion. It sort of doesn't really matter. But what we'll say is we've. We've already acknowledged in the, in this brief interview that our understanding of the temporal framework and the spatial framework of sort of breaking down the more we examined them, so why would we continue to use that framework to conjecture billions of years in the future when it's breaking down? Right now I'm in. The way we do it by the way, is to get to say it's a thing called a freedom in equation, which comes from general relativity from Einstein's theory Republican in Nineteen 15.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       And what Einstein's theory tells us is that there is a a given thing which is the fabric of the universe. It's called space time. So there's a thing and it doesn't tell you where it came from, it tells you there is such a thing, but it does tell you how that thing stretches and warps and deforms and changes in response to the matter and energy that are present in the university. So you can calculate, given this amount of matter in this amount of radiation and dark matter and dark energy. Now I've given all that stuff. Now, what will it do in the future? What is the response of the fabric of the universe to this stuff? And that's what enables us to say with some confidence that unless the new physics that we don't understand it, there might be, but given what we know now, the university is accelerating in its expansion, which we observe and he will come to a point where we think it will just double continually in size every 20 billion years or so forever.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       And we can make that prediction given what we know now. So there is, that's the baseline sort of baseline prediction is we are in the universe that will end up in what's called an exponential expansion, doubling in size every 20 billion years or so for ever because life cannot exist indefinitely in such a universe, of course not, but that's not necessarily a linear equation. And reality may be fractal, maybe spiral right at the basis of that Theorem is the acceptance and we don't know where it comes from, where it's going and it infers that it's, you know, as I know you've talked about a lot in your programs is expanding into apparent nothingness. But then you see that our linguistic and indeed psychological tools and neurological thoughts I would imagine from your perspective, start to break down. And so this is again where I sort of our invite sort of faith say one thing. It is a theory that is tested. So is the theory that allows us to build, for example, the satellite navigation system. So quite I'm not having a go at bloody Einstein or satellite navigation. It does work within, but it's a model. But. But Brian, when you say satellite navigation systems are fast, fantastic, though they are, these are not tools that we're going to use to measure the expanse of a dabbling

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       in millions of years. This is a localized bit of information that applies to us as corn or beans.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       Just a quick explanation of how we know it's expanding. Oh, is is simple observation that if you look at the light from a distant galaxy and then you find that it stretched so quite literally mean the color changed. It's called red shift. So it's a lie as a wavelength and the long wave. So rather than the short wave lengths are blue and what you find is light that should have been blue because you see it coming from a particular kind of answer in that galaxy is actually now red. And the explanation is that space has been stretching during the time the light has been traveling. And what you find is the further the galaxy is away, the more delight you're stretched. We should exactly what you'd expect. If you live in an expanding universe and by making those measurements she can measure how fast the universe has been expanding over billions of years and then this is a sim,

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       no one could refute it and it's absolutely beautiful and I only I know that already and the reason I know who it is because I've watched you explain it elegantly and in a way that makes sense to me and is meaningful to me, but what I would add to that is we see red, we see blue. We somehow within our minds experience rate, we experienced blue, we have eyes, we have senses. We live in this realm where something is experiencing something and like you said, atoms experiencing other atoms. Now what we have to continually acknowledges that there is a finite ability to understand information. There is evidently limitless information. At some point we're going to hit a wall and you know, continue the war and what exists beyond that, his theories, conjecture, imagination, and it's curious to me that is steeped in our theological history. There were people speculating in similar ways and reaching similar conclusions. Of course, no one can accurately say that's because space is stretching, so you experienced read is different because why you've traveled different for the different density of spite and people aren't saying stuff like that, but people are speculating and trying to understand the phenomena of limitlessness

Speaker 3:          00:49:33       reminded me. Yeah, and you remind about something you said earlier site which is this, which is the. So I would say that I would. I would disagree with you in a sense in that the finding out the way that nature works, I think is the is is is only done through what we might loosely call the scientific method, right? Which is which is making observations and building theories and checking them. However, it's not surprising to me that someone had a thought a few thousand years ago, which turns out to be in accord with what we discover. Where I would disagree is I don't think that they had those thoughts by some royal road to the truth or something. I don't think that. I think that they. So let's say these. You say in some context a religious context or theological context. Few thousand years ago,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       we think for the sake of argument in the Koran, no, put it back in that gates of Ellis Larry say we say we think that we live in an expanding universe. So we think there's points of light in the sky or other worlds as, as people did say, and we think they're all rushing away from each from us. Right? And then, uh, so, well, certainly for the galaxies, this is true. So the fact that someone said that it's something you could imagine saying, you can imagine looking at those points of light in dreaming, that there are other worlds. And actually Giordano Bruno famously did that and got burned at the stake in Rome in and his ashes thrown into the Tiber. I think as part of the new year's celebrations that could very well that grow and expand across the Tiber limitless particles because he said that he said, I think these are the worlds and, and wells without end limitless.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       And now he had no reason to say that. It was pure thought, but it's something that you could imagine someone saying very politically now. It turned out to be right, but I don't think that. I think the fact that he was right, it was coincidental. I don't think he had some path route to knowledge through meditation. The other thing, there is a route to knowledge of nature through meditation. There may well be. I'm sure there is a route to inner peace and a better understanding of yourself and your relationship with nature, but I would. I do not think that you can find out a. You could build new physical theories by, by meditating, by, by meditating alone. Everybody thinking. I mean I have to just crap when someone has a flash of intuition or inspiration, all these things and all this inflammation is entering the world through people's consciousness check it is by doing science.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       Definitely check it through science yet and I was just dreaming about something. I refuse to check it and that is wrong. That sort of like, you know, like I think from whatever angle you approach it, when you get into Dogma and doctrine and telling people what to do and what they can be and what they can't be. I think you get into really dicey territory from my perspective, where the bias is is has gone towards sort of science, particularly economics and particularly political science. Like what I'll watch your programs, I'll watch you talk about the way that was is behaving and pebbles in lakes and the life of strawberries of me. This is awesome and beautiful and glorious and precisely what we need to examine and track, but what I feel is is somehow the same way as the, you know, one could say the philosophy of Christ was used to underwrite a great big, powerful economic institution that ends up saying, don't put back there. It will revisit v people for Anatomy is you know, the people use science to say don't think that live there a bay these rules, and this is this. You're right, that this is entirely wrong because science science is a body of knowledge. It doesn't tell you anything really. It doesn't tell you anything about how to, what to make of that knowledge. And when it can tell you there are 2 trillion in the observable

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       universe, full stop. It doesn't tell you what that means, right? What, what do you to make it that doesn't tell you it's the same with, and we're going to go back to oppenheimer, you know, the idea that so you can build an atomic bomb and science tells you, it gives you the knowledge so that you can build an atomic bomb. It certainly does not tell you what to do with it right now. I mean, actually we would argue that common sense tells you not to use it. Don't press that button. It's. But um, so I think that's a key point. So for me, the, the, the proper interaction between science and religion and philosophy and theology and art and music and literature. All this data is that they go together to allow us to build a, a view of what our place in the universe is and what it means to be human.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       None of them on the own will allow you to build that idea, to come to that conclusion. What does it mean to be human? But you need them all for so beautiful, isn't it? Thesis, antithesis, synthesis that you have to come together. And that means that one of the things that you've mentioned a lot, Bryan, is humility that that there needs to be humility in all these communities and in a sense, an idea of an objective, like you said, about sort of a with the libertarianism ultimate individualism, communism, so of aversion of the subjugation of the individual in favor of the state. We have to, in order to build systems, human systems that make sense to us is going to need to be a collaboration between science, spirituality, our theology, and all these taxonomies are interchangeable. Because one man spirituality is another man's science night.

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       I recognize that what you're saying is on the bandwidth of material energy that can be measured, magnified, shrunk, weighed out, double blind, tested. There are certain things that we can say on this plane of factual at this time, at this moment, on this level. I think the crisis that we're going through at the moment that a civilization is. We don't have a point. There isn't a meaning to our civilization and I just made a program a while ago about commercial spaceflight until it's people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and the these entrepreneurs who were trying to go out beyond the earth and they all share a philosophy, a certain philosophy, which is that humanity, if you're looking for meaning what drives us, we need frontiers, frontiers of knowledge there, which you might call intellectual or spiritual frontiers and physical from tears. We need somewhere to go. Carl Sagan once said that somewhere out there, there's something waiting to be known in her. Beautiful. And uh, so, so we, we, we don't have that on the earth anymore. There are no frontiers rather obviously both political borders, but there are no places that we haven't been. There's no wild west push into. And so they think that the next step to go out upwards to the stars to step onto the moon and to Mars. And beyond that, the place where

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       our, where we will find meaning again. Well I hope possibly there. Right? And it's certainly very intrepid, but I would query the idea that we are without frontiers because there are certain ideological and physical spaces that we have not tried to access. We have not here on what value is it? If we start building new societies on Mars, if down here on bloody earth, we're treating each other appallingly. There are basic principles that have found their way into common consciousness, mostly for spirituality with long, long, long before monotheism pantheistic cultures. All find versions of look after one another. That's not to say there isn't a you and you would know much more than me, kind of brutality in nature, whether it's zoology or astronomy, there's a brutality and a finality, but are these the principles that we want to be governed by human beings? For the frontiers, I would be interested in traversing and heading toward a quality love new systems that give us, once again a vision so that the exploration of space becomes valid but not once again, the pursuit of economic power, the pursue of dominions, dominions new.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       We've conquered and subjugated mother earth. They see what other planets we can fuck up. One of the, one of the ideas is that how do you develop new political systems? So if you look at, for example, the uh, America, so, so the, the, the, the, the movement from Europe into America and that ended up with the American constitution. And so there, there are obviously there were pros and cons of this steady Brian Slavery, but you got to sign, one of the things you got was this document which I think is widely recognized as one of the, the, the, the most important statements of how you might send nice poems, but if it doesn't relate to the way you run a society, then what value is it? And this is precisely the problem now which is not put it into practice if you grow. And even then Brian, it was except for these people, you know, except for women except for these people that live here already.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       But the point is that no, this certainly there is a relationship between the physical and the spiritual. The, if we grow into new territory is physically there is a possibility that will somehow help us to discover within ourselves new notions. But like we can do that without getting on a spaceship, we could just start saying that's not judge people couldn't what they look like or some of the ideas is that our system on this planet now it's become quite ossified. What's that mean? Not Fossil and locked in. Whereas if you go to, if you imagine that in a hundred years' time or something we have the Mars colony is, is looking to become independent and the, the, the, the, the act of going to a new place and beginning again can allow you to access different ways of being in different ways of interacting that might not be possible here because of the historic borders and, and, and problems they may have.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       I sort of agree, but that doesn't make me want to get on a spaceship that makes people want to get on the barricade. It makes me want to change the world. It makes me say if we've reached a sort of a point of crisis, like for me it's not like, oh bloody hell, let's go somewhere else. For me it's like we're going to have to change. You will know that the one area where science is not being allowed to a, not the one, but I an area where science is not being allowed to inform the way we treat the planet is with climate change. People are not going right steady because for me, one of the things I've learned over the course of this podcast, and I must say this, one of the ones that have been like a great big iceberg of inflammation, smashing into my consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       Hopefully I can stay afloat, unlikely every other vessel in that analogy is that, um, is the, all our ideologies are caveated by. And as long as it doesn't affect the interest of the powerful, we must do something about climate change. As long as it doesn't affect the interest of the powerful, we must have says as long as it doesn't impact later. So for me, it's about finding ways of impact the interests of the powerful. Until we are prepared to do that and to ever better address that frontier is no point in jumping on Elan Musk space craft or saying, yeah, perhaps it is a virtual reality experiment. We have to start saying, what is happening? These people are behaving in this way. Right? Well, that's got to be regulated and stopped and stripped. You're right. I mean, interesting that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon Ceo, who's got a company blue origin, and he said to me, first of all, why is this company called blue origin?

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       Because it refers to the earth, the blue origin of humanity, and he said that the one thing we've learned in our exploration of the solar system and beyond is that this planet is the best one, right? We've learned that number one, and that means that is a jewel. He calls it a jewel of a planet and therefore we must protect it. At the same time, we have a large population which is making increase in depends on the resources. So what is the solution? How do you support an expanding population, all of whom want a better life for them and their children at the same time is protecting this beautiful blue planet. The answer is to get the resources from elsewhere. That's the answer. Answer. Another one would be to start prioritizing the health of the planet above economic needs. As long as you've got a capitalism, uh, in the form, it's now way in which many people would argue is way beyond capitalism.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Then then it's inevitable. And what Marx is critical theory that the first discovery page one is this is a limited resource we are. It cannot provide limited growth. So that's got to go there. May well have a, you can argue that you have a point in, in Europe, North America and the West that you might call, but if you talk about sub Saharan Africa or India or large parts of China, than it is difficult to see how you can lift those people out of poverty at the same time. That reducing the demand on the planet because those people are there and they live in poverty and it's right that they aspire to a better life for their children. But the, the, the answer can, can be innovation. I mean, for example, I was in China about two weeks ago and they just canceled the building of 150 coal fired power stations.

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       Canceled it and the reason they cancelled it was because solar power is cheaper, so it was purely, it was partly market driven decision, partly because they have a problem with pollution in the cities, but the point is the innovation has delivered a solution because solar power makes no impact on the planet. It's too shuffle. So like once you know that wisdom is acting on knowledge, once we have that, the facts just in the next thing should be around a phone calls like, Hey, guess what? Now solar power only as quickly as possible. Now. Whose interests do you challenge when you make that edict? So? Well, actually I've got side very quickly. I know you've got to stop. I guess where I'm going. I'm literally going to church. I do know I was talking to Brian Cox early to do in the book, but there's a guy who sat next to me on the panel and he was in Hong Kong, a property developer and he said, uh, the, one of the things about China that, that's rather, which is good, is the, the, the, the interests that, those fossil fuel interests that those big companies, it doesn't, it doesn't exist in China.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       The ruling party make the decision. They made the decision based on we don't want pollution, we want less pollution. Could it's killing our people and we want cheap, accessible power that is solar. So immediately I will draw a line through 105th, the contract for 150 coal fired power stations and I'll change it to solar panels. Done. And, and he said, he, he argued, I do obviously counter arguments, but he argued that that's why he said to me, that's why China will beat you, beat you, because we will make decisions like that. Now we could debate that. But it's interesting. And one thing that's always is distinct is that China, it comes from a different philosophical tradition, has a completely different Veltin Sean, so he's able to make decisions like that, not just because of Maoism and post communism, but because of the philosophies that proceeded it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Brown, I said just because when people are listening, I know that there are big problems with human rights. I was thinking I'm not waving the flag for the Chinese system and there are systems within which those interests matter a lot less. Yes, there are, there are. And that's what is interesting to me. What I feel Brian Cox is that you have been kind of I in my language, I profit and an educator and a Swami for such valuable beautiful information. And who knows what the future holds for me, you know, you get my vote on the next David attenborough deal. Like, I mean, like I, I see he was very much the human voice of science. But for me, like as you have indicated, there needs to be many voices in the human conversation for us to have a chance. And, uh, once again, what I feel like is that there is much to learn from the realms that can never be empirically demonstrated.

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       And now like I know that sounds quite high minded by simply talking about love and kindness and the ability for ordinary people for, to have their needs met and to have impact on the power Sagan said, for small creatures such as we, the vastness is variable only through love. Oh right. Carl Sagan. That's given to us. Where Brian Cox, I want you to on record, make a commitment to come back and be interviewed again. Would you do that? Yes. Whenever you want. I enjoyed it very much. I will be back tomorrow with you on. I really loved it. Might get intense because we're coming at things from quite different impositions, but I absolutely adore you and I'm very grateful to you for the education. Thank you. I've enjoyed it very much. Thanks man. Cheers.
