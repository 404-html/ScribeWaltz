Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Welcome John to the scheme of Russell brand. My guest today is Andy [inaudible], the accomplished presenter and writer and he's the cofounder and voice of the headspace app in his early twenties midway through a university degree in sports science and he made the unexpected decision to travel to the Himalayas to study meditation. Instead, it was the beginning of a 10 year journey, which took him around the world. Como La, culminating with ordination as a Tibet and Buddhist monk in northern India. He's transitioned back to normal life in 2004 sorry, I'm training briefly at Moscow state circus before returning to London to complete a degree in circus arts with the conservatoire of dance and drama whilst drawing up the early plans for what was later to become headspace. Welcome andy to under the skin. Thanks Russell. Even though under the skin in this instance is taking place in your studio where you actually welcomed the headspace.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Thank you very much. It's very generous of you to, we've never done this before and under the skin we've always recorded it, you know, in various places. In London, we're in Los Angeles now. We're in a one of the facilities of headspace and it's wonderful to be here. The reason that I was strongly motivated to meet you was because people kept mentioning headspace in under the skin at Stafford, the a survival expert and I call him the grunge bear grylls. Not that I don't love bear grylls would be straight standard bear grylls vanilla. I love that guy too, but it's Stafford. He's like the Nirvana version. He loves headspace and more and more people were mentioning headspace to me and I thought I'm going to have to meet the people that are headspace. Thanks for coming in and this by the way, I held this place you, you're very welcome.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       If you're, if you're in La, this is lovely to hear your voice. Thank you very much. I will take you, I'll take you up on that. Thank you. That's really very generous of you. Now what as defined to headspace thus far, even though I know it's been a 10 year journey is it seems to me and and I, I used the APP myself that you are making a meditation accessible, fun. Hello, quill. Hopefully I think you are. I love the little animation videos at that and they're like, what the reference points are for those creatures that I don't know quite what they are, but I like him. I love your tone. I was talking to someone, I'm over here acting at the moment and uh, I was talking to another actor on set and he was talking about meditation, the challenges that he faces. It goes, you want to do headspace mate?

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Like it's just like a British bloke going, all right, sit down. Remember, you don't need to shut your eyes. Just relax. It's not complicated. And maybe, hopefully you've watched the video. If you haven't, you might want to watch that now. Like I don't, and I sort of like what I feel like part of what I've been trying to do myself is to make, not meditation because I'm not qualified to bring it to people, but certainly the conversation around spirituality, I wanted to make it more accessible. Tell me how this journey began for you. Uh, the journey into

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       meditation or headspace. More specifically, I think initially headspace. How come you, when I'm going to set up an APP and popularized meditation, how have you done this? Yeah, well, it's important to say, so I'm, I'm just, I'm just a, I'm a cofounder, so the other cofounder, rich, um, rich pearson, so very, very dear friend now. And this was, uh, was something that we came up with together and we've had an amazing team of people and also I love so much love and support from people along the way. I think an ungrateful person because you're the real deal. I knew you're a monk so you're not this brilliant idea of Ed space and I'm going to smash it. You're obviously is totally humble person to tune into the limitless, but it's also the truth as well. Cool. We meet rich, so we, um, I, I left.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Um, so I left the monastery and, and decided to start teaching. I was doing, um, one-to-one in a clinic back in, back in London. So this was, you know, we'll look at the circus thing later. Um, but kind of after the, the circus, I was kind of okay. I knew kind of the language that I wanted to use and w and I knew by then what techniques, so I kind of felt would work outside of the need to even feel compelled to do that. And why did you think I want to popularize meditation? What was the sense that you had that it was necessary? This isn't, this is more tricky cause it wasn't, it wasn't like a, a plan. So in the same way people asking you, why did you go away and become a monk? I felt an overwhelming sense that that was what I had to do.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       And I wasn't able to necessarily put it into two words. And I didn't come up with a list of pros and cons of, of being a monk and not being a monk in the same way when I left the monastery, I guess if it's helpful to take a step back and when I was teaching meditation, so I had, um, uh, the monastery had asked me to teach at a meditation center in Moscow and I ended up living there for just over four years, four and a half years. And I would see different types of people and I'd often get expats coming along and they really wanted to learn meditation and they really wanted the benefits of meditation, but they didn't necessarily want to adopt a faith. They didn't necessarily want to chat to a guy in robes and to come into this kind of place where there was a lot of ritual and tradition. So that was, I think, the beginning of me thinking, well, there's this need and what's more important to me? Is it teaching meditation or is it being a monk? And I felt very strongly that teaching meditation was, was more useful and that I could present it in a way that I, you know, I didn't, it didn't matter whether I was wearing a shirt and tie or whether I was, whether I was wearing kind of ropes, you know? So that was the beginning. I would say. What's the best thing about being a monk?

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       Strange as it may sound, not having anything because there's nothing to worry about. So yeah, freedom you give, you give away. I mean, which is strange because you're living within four walls and it's very kind of institutionalized in some ways. But within that there is a, you know, freedoms from within and there was a, an inner feeling of freedom and there's no, you don't have to achieve anything. You'd have to prove anything. You don't have to worry about losing anything. You own nothing that there's, so there's a real sense of freedom in that. In your case, it was a Tibetan monastery in the Himalayas, is that correct? So it was, uh, I started in Himalayas and then I went to Burma and trained in a, in a Burmese monastery. And then eventually I ended up kind of, uh, going back to Tibetan monastery and doing five years.

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       And it's about in tradition. Yeah. Really? Yeah. And you, the relationship with the guru, I teach her, it's kind of sacred thing, isn't it? Who is your teacher? He is. So, um, I think there, there are different types of teachers along the way, you know, so there were more kind of instructor kind of type teachers are there, people who they're the real deal, they've, they've put in the time and they've done it. But there, there may be not kind of considered sort of like as a, as a guru or something like that. And someone who was incredibly important in my own personal kind of journey was a, he's an Irishman called, called Donald and Donald Donald was a real deal. Like he, he was, he trained and he did just over 12 years in, in retreat, in longterm retreat. Um, where did you encounter him and were already done them 12 years.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       So he did 12 years. He was, he was on his way to the Himalayas and he stopped off at a monastery [inaudible] monastery in Scotland, which is back in the 60s. It just opened, it just started. And the Abbot of the monastery persuaded him to stay and do a six month retreat rather than go to India. And he finished a six month or to treat. And they said, well, look, we're just about to start the first three and a half year retreat, you know, would you, it's the first one in the west. It's kind of ever happened. The Tibetans have this three and a half year retreat, you know, would you like to do it? And Oh yeah, okay. It's fairly easy kind of going guy. And he was like, yeah, sure, I'll try it. And so he did that one and then he did another one and then he did another one.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       And by the time I met him, he'd, he'd left the monastery. He was never a monk, so he was in that, you know, he went through that process, but he did it as a lay person. And, um, by the time I met him, he was in Moscow and that was my main kind of reason for going out to Moscow to meet him and train with him. And you wanted to meet him? I really want it. Why did you want to, I just met the, the Abbot of the monastery in Scotland. I'd gone back there and, um, a friend invite me along and I remember just seeing the picture of this guy, you know, and it said that he was at the Moscow kind of center and there was just, there was something about him which resonated. And I felt really strongly that there was, there was something for me to, to better understand and learn.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       And because he'd gone through that journey, he'd come to as a westerner, he'd gone through, he'd kind of, my understanding of it is, is that he'd sort of transcended the, the, the tradition. So he was no longer kind of stuck with the words and the concept and the frameworks. And so he kind of operated outside of that, which allowed him to communicate in a way which just struck a chord, which I'd never really kind of experienced before because I'd always been in foreign monasteries where it was, you know, this is how it is and it's like this. And always the same language was used. And so he kind of cut through that for me and helped me see in a, in a really different way. I think that somehow you in, that's obviously significant as you go on along with your partner and your team to become the founder of headspace that are significant men or for you with someone that didn't use the conventional traditional lexicon by in fact colloquially taught, taught meditation, which is precisely what headspace does now for 20 million users.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       So I can see why he would be a significant figure, but it also seems significant to me, Andy, that the, uh, impulse to connect with this guy seem very intuitive, very instinctive. What's that about do you think? Yeah, yeah. I think maybe I'm just kind of rash. I tend, I tend to kind of move from instinct I would say or you know, I, I tend not to over overthink things. So whether it was kind of going away and becoming a monk and that felt like just so intuitively the right thing to do. Um, I did it in the same did you did, what was that? I mean from Bristol in England, aren't ya? You're just a bloke from Bristol in England, that's suddenly you're a monk in the Himalayas, then you're, there's a bit where you're nearly in the center. Cause my mate Gareth, which uses the shower, his biography sounds like a lie that you'd make up to impress a girl for a while. Then I was in the circus then I was a necessity in for a couple of weeks. They removed that part.

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       Kevin Keegan Mad Celtic life. He sounds, it does sound bizarre. I think if you, if you look at it as a, um, there's no way of explaining away the monk to circus monk the clown bit. But um, basically until the age of 21, I competed in gymnastics. So kind of, I had the acrobatic kind of background. I then went to become a monk and for 10 years I didn't know exercise and that was something that I really, really missed. So as soon as I had the opportunity, you can't, you can't exercise as a monk. So as soon as I finished being a monk, why, why can't, why he's meditating all day? That's it. Just sitting around, sitting around with your eyes closed, not doing anything. Exactly. So and I was desperate to kind of go back and do, do that. So that was the first thing I did when I stopped being a monk.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       And so yeah. And so you know, I went back to do an acrobatics and stuff and I transitioned a bit of extremists mate, one minute, next minute year moncton and going to be in a circus now it sounds like that focus and concentration, one of the things he seems like he must have and also as a, as I say when I listened to you on headspace interest in tea, you say other stuff like it's a like you must have a good relationship with your inner life concentration and focus for an acrobat concentration and focus for gymnasts, concentration, focus and aspect might say of uh, of meditation. So you're you but you pursued the monastic path. Yeah, we briefly spoke upstairs and like monastic life is determined by a structure, isn't it? You get up at a certain time, you eat certain things and evidently you're not allowed to do any bloody size.

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       So like how long did you live that life? So I lived there on and off. So I started as a, as a lay person, um, uh, in, in northern India. And then so I went, became a novice monk, so I moved to, uh, moved to Burma. Um, and then I went and went on to become a monk in Tibet. Introducers over a period of, of 10 of 10 years. And these transitions, are they marked by Sarah many and commitment? What are these transitions? How would I mark [inaudible] some are, yeah. I think when you become a novice monk there's a ceremony and I think it becomes a bit more formal as you become a fully ordained monk. So it was, I didn't bring the pictures are upstairs, but I'm definitely going to look, you've got shaved that now. I mean it's different. I mean did you look, cause when I first met you it just then like, oh yeah, he's a monk back are sort of like, you know, people that got a vibe.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       Like I've tried to lighten it up. Cause you knew though, cause he knew I used to be probably, yeah. Probably there was confirmation bias, but also also there was the sense I I me my background in addiction, you sense when people have like we have drug addicts, they're not present like well whatever type of drug it is, there think mostly their life when they're not taking drugs is just the thing that they have to deal with in order to get back to drugs. Now we have spiritual meditation. People I impact it has on me is it makes me vibrate a bit or I don't know, I like, it keeps me up. I something about it. I like, and I remember when I was a little kid that we're not looking at us 25 seven so when I was 27 I met this gaze there. That was a sort of hardcore swami rather not swamis from the Harry Krishna sect.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       Right. And when I met him it was like I got a real buzz off it. It was like a meat and a beautiful woman actually. It was like, I was like, Oh God, I really want to impress him. I like him a lot of goal. It so exciting. And I recognize, and then when you read autobiography of a Yogi, I'm like, when Yogananda talks about his guru, his great love, great passion. So yeah, I mean if I think, you know, you talking just now about kind of gurus and stuff and I'll start off with teaching. If I think about sort of the first time I met who I would consider to be sort of like guru type sort of status. Is that that Irish it Donald? No, it's not. It's um, it's a chap called his holiness the come up and who escaped from Tibet, um, when he was 17 years old because of what Chinese occupation and I met him back in a, those are quite serious threat to his life.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       So I met him, um, back, I don't know, late 1990, something like that. And I remember the f even I knew nothing about him. And the first time I met him, I can own only described that moment as completely limitless in nature. And whether you define limitless bye, bye love, bye space. By time there was a feeling of connection, which I had never experienced up until that kind of point. And it was without any of the kind of, as I say that the baggage of association or anything else. I didn't really kind of know much about him. He was 17 year old, 17 years old. So he was like a kid. He was a kid, he could, he was 17, but he could have been 80 or 90 years old. There was something about him which was completely timeless, ageless. And that for me was the beginning of a very different kind of journey into meditation.

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       I would say. What happened to you in retrospect? I think, um, I mean it shattered a lot of kind of illusions I might have had, but it also was the beginning of, um, sort of, I guess a journey of devotion as well. And I think devotion is often kind of talked about in, in different different ways. I'm not talking about a blind devotion, but a real sense of something being, and it was personified by that person, but it wasn't really about that person. It was something kind of bigger and yet there was a a direction for that. Again, whether you think of his devotion or love or whatever there was, it felt like it had a very definite sort of direction and purpose. So I felt just the connection that I'd never, I'd never experienced before. Inescapably Andy, we are talking about quite profound ideas, profound and powerful energies that some wallet supersede the colloquial and secularized world of the headspace APP, which I think he's a brilliant, brilliant tool, but part of the compromise it's continually made, excuse me, when reaching out to what we would say, you know, we would call secular people are nonreligious people or people that aren't spiritual, you continually.

Speaker 2:          00:16:43       So again, it's just a thing just to help you relax, just making more effective at work. Right? And then how do we fit this together with this stuff that I'm kind of into, which like seven year old kid that's like the golden child. It's conveying some limitless, infinite wisdom makes these person are irrelevant. Like you sense God in someone or you know, and again that's a complicated word, but the limitless to use your term, how do we align that with the needs of headspace? Is it because you look at them as separate things or what? I really don't actually. I think it's um, it's been a journey that has just kind of evolved and um, I feel like w to suggest it's gone full circle suggests that something has been achieved. And I don't mean it in that way. I mean simply I've been on a journey where I started off with one particular kind of language in a way of kind of looking at the world and thinking about things I found.

Speaker 2:          00:17:36       I went through another kind of period where I was using different language and looking at the world in a different kind of way. And then I came back to a situation where I'm using the old language but to, to kind of refer back to that. And for me they're not different. And I personally, I think the danger of kind of having any kind of labels like normal people or spiritual people, I think that is defined that the essence is defined by being present. And I think as soon as we take on the label of being spiritual or nonspiritual, then we stepped away from the essence that we're trying to kind of describe. So I don't feel like there's a difference. There's definitely, I, you know, we're talking about staff using different, I wouldn't talk about this kind of in, in the APP because I don't feel like it's the most helpful, most relevant thing for the person coming to the APP.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       But as we kind of, as we kind of dig a bit deeper, I think, you know, is relevant to my personal kind of journey. Um, and all of that informs kind of what has gone into the APP. None. Nothing in the APP is not my own idea. Nothing is kind of been invented by me. It's really me just kind of taking, you know, other people's wisdom and trying to kind of bring it together in a way that feels right for people like us, right, who don't live in a monastery, of course. Yes, there is no, it doesn't in any way undermine or compromise the content of the APP to say that someone that's been a monk for 10 years is going to have had different experiences than someone who's just picking up their phone and going off and online 10 minutes where I'm not worrying about my job or wherever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:19:15       You know, that's obviously distinct is obviously something that you've dedicated a great deal of exploration toward. And there's many things I'm fascinated about here, mate, because like when we talk about the, uh, the, the devotion that is in here within a guru student system, when you talk about the discipline and structures that were, um, prevalent in your monastic life, it is in escapable that these models have been extricated from western life as we know it. So that's a key. Must be a huge challenge. He is, and I, I, you know, if in a perfect kind of scenario like maybe people, and it's so, it's interesting, people sometimes come into the APP and they get to a point where they say, actually, I really, you know, where, where did you train, uh, where did you do retreat? As you kind of want to go and investigate kind of that a little bit more, you know, so the people who kind of follow on and go go down that route.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       And so sometimes I do feel like, yes, there is a, a journey that can be delivered through the APP, but it's one part of the journey and maybe at some stage some people will want to go off and explore that, you know, outside of the APP as well. Yes, yes. That is a, like, it's a departure point. This is like good way of learning meditation. Um, but another one of the things that must be significant and it's something that we've touched upon already, is the use of language. The words don't really like, you know, we were talking before

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       andy about how as soon as you start talking about concepts, we, it becomes complicated. It becomes complicated because you're dealing with something somewhat intangible. I genuinely feel like the more, the more we talk about

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       meditation, the further we move away from the experience. So we could just say, and not say anything for now, but at the same time, like you got to say something. And so I, I genuinely feel like that there has to be some kind of conversation and it has to be signposts and has to be guidance as a, there's an old parley kind of term. Um, and he's Kalina Mctier, which is, I believe that's from the lion king. God, God common. Yeah. I believe it's a warthog. That's right. The poly walked Paul. And, um, so I think there's, what does it mean that it means trusted friend or kind of like trusted guide and, and for me that's the role that it's, it's how to be kind of a rather than kind of laying on concepts and saying you should think in a certain way or you should live in a certain

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       way, it's more kind of, okay look I went away and did this thing and you know, I find it really helpful. Maybe I've done a little bit more than, than some other people, a little bit less than some other people, but I'm really happy to be like a trusted guide into to use that experience and to try to find a language that worked for me. And my hope is that it works for others as well. Definitely do. And it really brilliantly. That's fair. Come on me. I think you've cracked it now. Like one of the great lies of our time, it seems to me is the idea that the personal liberty is freedom and personal liberty means that we can be who we want to be. But I'm starting to understand that that is not the case, that there is no such thing as a vacuum.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       There is no such thing as a sort of an uninfluenced freedom. What we have is I think we live in an extremist consumerist culture that our time is deeply influenced by ideologies, so all pervasive that we can't see them because they are everything. It'd be like trying to identify individual molecules of oxygen or whatever. So like with our opposing structures, without alternative structures, our role in civilization, our role in society, but it comes to consume. We consume, we don't know how to look at the world differently. We consume our politics, we consume our news. We have show business politicians now, so there is a great necessity for spirituality to get a foothold in contemporary life. Technology is going to be part of it. In a way. Headspace is a perfect product. Are you surprised by the way that it's gone by the place that you found herself? I'm not surprised the people have warm to the idea of practicing meditation. I think it's

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       timeless. I think is universal. It's been around for thousands of years. The need, you know, people experienced anxiety and sadness and anger back then. You know, there's in the same way that they do now. I think the difference is you say now that it's almost like there's a bit of a squeeze kind of and that we're all feeding now, squeeze, feeling more overwhelmed by all those things. So I think yeah, it's, it's perhaps no surprise that more than ever people are looking for for that. My only concern about it is that in the sense of urgency and need the, it becomes in people's minds at least a a fix rather. So it's like how, how I'm feeling stressed, how do I fix that and not sleeping? How do I fix that? Rather than, okay, how do I understand my life or my mind in relationship to stress or in relationship to sleep?

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       And that meditation is about understanding. It's not about fixing something or changing something. So I feel like that's a very delicate dance and balance that we're all kind of engaged in state. How, how to, on the one hand offer people the aspirin because they have a headache and we should treat the headache and at the same time say wood's not about tree treating the symptom. It's about looking at and understanding the underlying cause. Is it, does it have the potential to be extremely dangerous in revolutionary? Some of these ideas in that, it seems to me that the natural end point is it kind of throwing off the shackles of our contemporary way of life, beyond even the external structures and perhaps more importantly the internal structures that make us victim to those external ones. If I, if people start to say, well, there's more to life than consuming, there's more to life than what I do for a job.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       What happens if community start forming around different idea? What happens then? Yeah, I mean I think that's a really interesting idea. You know, and there's quite an exciting idea and I don't think it's the differences. I don't think it has to be this or that in, I don't think it has to be so kind of extreme. I, I personally feel like it's quite possible to, to live in the world with the world as it is, but two at the same time to do that with a sense of awareness and compassion and you know, that means that we're taking responsibility for living the way that we choose to live. And perhaps as a result, there were some ripples from that. Hopefully the other people around us kind of benefit from. And maybe even some of those people might kind of think, hmm, you know what? Maybe I'll do a little bit of that. So rather than it being sort of coerce if in nature or any kind of sense of pushing, it's more just taking responsibility for one's own sanity and a health and relationships and then kind of seeing what happens

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       as a result. I think you're quite right about that because I was thinking just as you spoke that we are different men. You and I that and the, uh, a monk and by nature is, it seems that that journey is about, there is some distinction, some discretion, some separation monastery. Think about that sometimes when I was young, when I met that man, that man is a matter of fact. I said, do you think I should become a monk? Did you think he laughed at me when I said it? He laughed at the idea. And this was, that was then, you know, and, but like, I sometimes wish that I were, I sometimes wish that there were robes that didn't know what my position is in the road. The, I don't believe in this. This is not who I am. And I don't want to talk about those things, you know, but like I, but, but, but because I am a person that has found flesh very, very appealing and corrupting, I've found drugs very, very engaging. I like senses. I like sensuality. I like the body. So I've had to come to meditation, Yoga, spirituality with a gun to my head, you know, pretty much it's worth saying, one, I've not always been a monk. Um, so there were tight for a bit lunatic biography and 21 years when I wasn't monk. And I haven't been a monk now, right,

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       for 12 years. And, um, you know, I, I have, uh, I have a wife and, and I have kids. And so it's, it's in the same, it might, it might be different, but in the same way, it's not that I'm, I'm unaffected by those things. You know, I was drawn to my wife because she was beautiful and I found her beautiful. And so I don't know if that's what you're kind of talking about, but I, well,

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       in the, I suppose it seems that you are, when you answered that question about like me saying, because what I see when people talk about spirituality, I believe that like a connection to, you know, like the softly even take it, whether it's at the extreme end of being in a monastery somewhere in Tibet or listening to headspace APP, we're talking about a true for an authentic relationship with this self in inverted commerce that brings about peace. Now for me, there's a good deep truth in that. And the more people that have access to that, the truth is likely that that would have limitless repercussions and will bring about a lot of change. And I feel that, uh, your, I agree with you andy, that we cannot start sort of like waving flags and bashing down doors and there's nothing more ridiculous than when you read of conflict in Buddhist countries and very full of like what's going on. You've missed the point I suppose. Any religion really. It's like what the believe leave. You've missed the point. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       I wonder about expansionism I wonder about evangelism because I feel that there are ideas that are need to be, that needs to be spread. I don't think within the limited conversation of contemporary politics as solution will be found. I think that they're just pulling mutations and versions of each other. I think most people think that they were experiencing a time of grotesqueness, of, uh, of nostalgia, ethno nationalism, old ideas, this weird twitching flinching dinosaur corpse thing with a wig on. There's like a bit Kuli at time. And I feel that precisely list solution is to get in touch with essence, essence as you described the Andy and, and I feel that, you know, like, you know, you are

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       doing this thing that's means at 20 million people are meditating now and it's really, it's you that's doing it and it's good that these good and episode and perfect and necessary that you are a man that has lived as a monk for 10 years and now lives a lay person life. Because that means that there is authenticity. Because if it was me doing it, be like, hang on a minute, this, that going to have to give her for meditation, the time is right. You know, like you're doing it with a few people out there doing that. I bet. I bet there are. But like this is authentic and true foreign in spite the fact that there's like comfortable animation and it's well put together and it's, you know, when I, when he showed me in that room that you'd do the broadcast in a fire that he's like a chapel, you know, it's silent.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       It's dark, it's sacred. Yeah. And, and I think like any, any place is not defined by how it looks, you know, it's just like it's a recording studio. But I think the feeling kind of in there is, um, I, I just think it's the same as anything, right? Like if we, if we go to work in a particular kind of space, every space has its own kind of feeding and we don't even have to be into that sort of stuff. You know, that kind of language or vocabulary to even experienced that. We got to one place and we experienced one kind of feeling. We go to another places, different kinds of fish. Maybe we walk into a room with one person, they're angry, we don't even talk to them, but we know that they're angry. There's a feeling kind of in the room. So this kind of stuff exists even if we just talk about it in, in that sort of way.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       So I think that's what's interesting, that we don't necessarily have to go out there and talk about it. We can. And I think it's exciting and it's good that some people do, especially within some kind of realms, but specific to meditation, I feel like if each and every one of us takes on that responsibility to simply to practice, then over time that has an exponential kind of effect because the feeling is such that it starts to impact the lives of the people around us. You're right. I think I spoke to David Lynch once about meditation and about potentially having confrontations with people on air, like going on tv shows and thinking, oh, I'm going to have to advocate for meditation. He says, well, there's no point in doing that. Really just tell them, learn to meditate and it will change. It will change. It's a practice.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       It's something that alters your consciousness. Suddenly. I've become aware of that. Yesterday again when I was on that TV set or talking to kids that are like I guess 19 years old, his beautiful young men and I'm struck by how bright and brilliant and ready and different they seem, and I wonder if this is some perennial quality of youth or young people are changing now. If people are ready, if there can be some impersonal quality to that, uh, God, man, Buddha kid, then perhaps there are sort of meteorological spirits traveling through us. I think there's this a change, right? There was a shift. I do think, um, and definitely, you know, we, we work a lot with, with, you know, uh, kids and teenagers written, you know, learning meditation and, and I, I do feel like, do you have, or do you mean by that work a lot with, so, so going into going into schools, developing programs for specifically, so meditation for children, it's, it's in app for them to do with their parents or we've, we've done, you know, working in schools as well, um, with the intention that it becomes part of the school kind of curriculum and, and my feeling is that they have watched and learned from our experiences and they want something different.

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       Yeah. And there's, there's a real kind of readiness and as you say, like a passion about that. And I feel like as much as people kind of give, kids are really kind of tough time. I actually feel that they're coming through. Yes, they're challenged by all the distractions of digital and everything else, but actually feel like they're more altruistic in nature, more socially minded than I've seen in a long time. Certainly our generation. Um, what do you, uh, when you're d does meditation work for you, right? You've mentioned that you're married, man, you've got kids even been through that sort of pre, you've had quite difficult life and you've lost a lot of people that you've loved in your life. I don't have, is more difficult than anyone else's life, but definitely there was some, there are some key things that have happened that have influenced my own journey. Does it work, you know, the spiritual life, does it work? Is it effective when it comes to the crunch, when the pain comes, when the divorce comes, when people die, when people leave you, when you lose control of life and its circumstances, do you say to people, this works this way of life? Can you, can you just, what do you mean by work? Does it help with pain and misery and sadness and despair and loneliness and agony and anguish? [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       my wife's listening. Um, I'm not quite sure why those words. I just mean that myself. I know what you mean. Cause the question that Gareth's written, actually, it's normally Garrett's here doing these things with me. I'm not so generous as you are. You Go, oh, like Richie set up, may I just take the credit, that's my function in life is to take credit. But like one of the questions he sort of pointed out, he goes, he's seen like that me, my way of dealing with life was I'm going to take a lot of drugs. I'm gonna do what's, you know, I'm going to do external things. I'm going to get involved in the material world. Whereas evidently what you did is you went, I'm going to find another way and the other path. And, and I did. And I think, I think he's so circumstantial.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       I look in another, in another town, in an with another set of friends. You know, I just think it was so for all of us, it's so specific to that time in that place, in that environment. Um, yes, kind of. I'd had meditation in my background, you know, like I'd grown up kind of doing it and stuff and my mom. And so that was, that was in the background. But definitely to begin with, I think, you know, my immediate reaction was one to go to the pub with everyone else, you know, and then kind of, I probably spent a few years of doing that and not really seeing a shift in how I felt, you know? So I went away and it became a student and did all the things that students do and it was great fun. But I never felt that I had any kind of liberation beyond the, the sense of, you know, temporary freedom that I might have had for a few hours on, on, on a nighttime. The next day you wake up. And so I never felt that deep sense of fulfillment that I felt was possible

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       straight away. Yeah. Fill that. And then I went, you bet at the time, moment of reflection ever happening. Well, mine was maybe less extreme. Just kill that moment of reflection. That guy's got to go. Yeah, maybe I was, I dunno. Do you get angry still? Do you get angry? Of course. What happens? What do you do if you feel angry?

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       Um, I mean I, I tend not to run around kind of ranting and raving at people. I don't think it, it manifests like that, but you know, I have a three and a half year old son and an eight month old baby and we don't sleep very much in the house. So it's kind of inevitable at some stage that that anger kind of comes up. And as much as as possible, it's, it's trying to bring the practice to life, which is to, is to witness it and not, not to become the anger, but to, to notice the anger is, is kind of present. And sometimes I miss it. Um, you know, as in I don't see it straight away and so I'm already kind of on my son go, Yep,

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       why don't you just do it? That's anger. Okay. Sometimes you might want to jump off one of those policy and cars and they'll just remember are the side of the road. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's, that's what I like thinking about it. When we came without care, me and my wife were like the first couple of nights the baby's jet, we're jet lagged and I still got, I remember it being like four or five o'clock in the morning and just go, look, we're going to have disease. How can cause this depression? I think this is wrong. No it's no manipulation. And my wife went and had lunch with jet lag. Yeah. Like cause me, I think I attached very quickly to phenomena and states of mind so that I need meditation. I need to be able to go, oh okay this is just, you are not this feeling of anger.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       You are not this fear. The fear will pass and you will be present now. Like I still feel like even though it's 15 years since I've taken drugs or drunk, I still feel like I'm subjective fear in a very powerful way. Like I can be hit with fear that demands activity is like I've gotten to have to do something. I'm feeling this feeling right. Smashing everything up, run, you know. And I like, so it's very hard to just, okay, just breathe in. So, but you're saying because the meditate, the meditative practice that you have, and of course yours is a very particular, um, Fara version actually is applicable in situations where the free, you know, if you're all just kicking off or, yeah. I, I actually think any meditation

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       practice which isn't applicable to daily life, uh, yeah, I kind of wonder what's the point a little bit because I don't think any of us, you know, it's not applicable in daily life, but fucking exactly. So people sit for 10 minutes and do the meditate. What about the other 23 hours and 50 minutes in the day? So I feel like there has to be a way of bringing that. I just see it as if we can remove ourselves from the madness of our lives for long enough to get familiar with what it means to be present, what it means to be open and curious and loving, compassionate, then we can start to bring those qualities back into our everyday life. And it's an ongoing kind of training. And, and I, I love that back and forth, you know, where you know, you know it's, Oh wow. Actually yeah, that's still kind of happens. Okay. You go back to meditation and, and over time that kind of, it strengthens where meditation is no longer separate from your life. Meditation is simply a time within your life or within your day when you pause and close your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:39:35       That's makes sense. This thing I've been thinking about lately, like the relationship between the word whole and the word holy, that there is a sort of becomes an identifiable wholeness to your life. Meaning that if I'm out on my own and I feel like, uh, an attractive person pays me attention, I don't think, oh brilliant. I'm just this guy now. I don't, no, no, no. I'm the guy that's got the wife and the child. You are always that you are a complete person. You don't compartmentalize yourself off into me, Oh, in this corner of my life I get away with this. This is the corner of my life where I do that. And then what is one thing? There was one thing, they were completeness. And you think the meditation creates some sort of connections and foundations and essence? Yeah, no, no question. You know, we were, we were chatting about this, um, you met ash just before we came here and I'll, I'll buddy, he's a lovely, lovely guy. And you know, we grew up together and we were just chatting kind of about this idea of um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       and, and he was saying kind of when did you first kind of really feel that, you know, and, and I, I still, I still remember kind of being in, in the monastery and something kind of just melting away where I no longer felt that extreme sense of self, a sense. And again, I'm not suggesting for a moment that, you know, enlightenment or anything like this, but just a glimpse perhaps of of what it meant not to feel kind of isolated or separate from the world. And in that, in that moment there wasn't, there wasn't a person to be separate from every, there was only hole and there wasn't even any one there to, to experience and to think about it. Is this the whole or is it not? There's simply that was all that existed. Oh, wicked. And, and I, I feel like that was a low is it's just an experience in those come and go.

Speaker 2:          00:41:28       And it all depends on how stable those experiences are and how much can they become a part of our lives. For me it was quite temporary, but I do feel like there was, there was something kind of in that which really spoke to a different way of viewing the world. You see Buddha and Jesus and that kid you, that 17 year old God man, you met them catch. Do you think they're living there? You think that there's in that state all the time? It seems to be, you know, it, it, there was, um, there's one other fight if I, if I can. So it was another monastery that I went to, to visit. So there are this, there's this a monastery for a second pretty much monastery and monitoring. Oh, want to transcend, you've had enough transcendent to get out, go back to your wife, monastery, Gulf.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       It was, um, there was, um, there's a kind of an elite troop of kind of meditators, right? So they, um, within this tradition they get picked out the cad you school, um, of, so there were four main ones in Tibet. Cadre was one of the four. What's that alarm or he's a good look. Um, and he's, he's very well known obviously because of his just transcendent wisdom and compassion. But he's also, he was also the head of government for a long time and sort of, although he's not the head of all four schools, he's kind of, he's probably better known in the West than anyone else. And in this monastery, um, they, they, they pull the kids out pretty young and obviously the kids have to want to do it. They have to, and they have to show a real kind of, um, what's the word?

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       Like a lot of potential in meditation. The families have to be on board as well, and they're picked out and from about the age of 10 or 11 they're in strict retreat. They never go outside, they never see anyone speak to anyone or anything. And we were invited to this monastery and it's very, very rare to meet anyone from that thing. And then the guy who ran it was, he lived above the monastery and I was with this chap, Donald, and I think because I was with this chap donal, we were invited to go and see him and going into that room, I went in there, there were four of us that went in again, that that is someone I would say who was absolutely living that sense of wholeness in, I don't believe there was an ounce of separation kind of left in him.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       He was there, but he wasn't there. It was, there was nothing but a presence of again, awareness, compassion, openness, love, whatever you want to kind of call it or define it. There was, there was someone there, but there was nobody there. Yeah. And I felt like he was, he had completely transcended itself. So that that was his existence. It's like the realization that your biographical identity and your primer, you're sort of primal motivations, your last a jealousy, fear or even personal love, our temporal interpretations. And if your identification with the interpreter, the witness, the experience becomes your base, your essence, then there is freedom

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       because curiously it's a colloquialism again. After I met that Geezer adding that Swami and I went to my mate Matt Huskies, it's weird. Right? And it goes, I couldn't imagine there's anything you could say to him that would knock him off. He said like, yeah, like, and my mate went like, yeah, what if you went might as some skin, it's fucking up your car. Whoa. I wouldn't like there's nothing you could say or like, do you want to be in our band? He wouldn't go all right. Yeah. They're like, you're, there's nothing. There is nothing to get, there is nothing to lose. Yeah. Hmm. So yeah, I'm really into it. The other thing is though with Amma, the hugging saint who I also feel like she emanates great wisdom and I'd have followers think, but you know, they're very in like that Hindu as you know better than me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       Like they're much more idolatry based. So they're saying this woman is an incarnation of carly or some, you know, they say she's got, yeah now like I was watching her and she's amazing and powerful and visibly going into China, send an states and stuff like that. But there's this big night, right? It was New Year's eve and I have 10,000 followers hanging out and like, you know, sort of his big party and chanting. It was cool and she's up, you know, enthroned and stuff. There's a bit where someone, a musician like messed up something and I've actually just been always sought out, finger out, like in whatever southern Indian language she speaks. She went and sought sorta thing out of all, she's still interacting with the material world. Here's why one though. And they sort of say in Christianity and Christ says like, you know, in the world, but not of it. Yeah. You, what do you feel about perennialism? What do you feel about identifiable, uh, truths that are appear in many, if not all spiritual traditions. I also,

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       again, I think that the more that we, the more that we rely on words and concepts, the further we move away from truth. So the, the challenge always I think with these great teachers is that there's always an essence there. And there's, you know, it's often talked about is sort of mystical schools, but I just think there's an essence and the essence is to be, is awareness and compassion for what, I can't find other other words but that it's called by many names, but you know, for the, for the sake of this, it's called at call it that I feel like that's at the heart of every, every lineage, every tradition, every faith, every tradition. And I just feel that the further it kind of moves outwards and as it moves out into society, the less and less it has to do with the essence.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       And the more and more it has to do with a structure, often a structure reliant on, you know, the power and government and all kinds of other kind of factors that start to play into it. So all of a sudden like the essence is lost. And so people are doing things and going through the motions of things and not even really kind of necessarily knowing what they're doing or why they're doing or even having the benefit of experiencing the essence of that kind of practice. So, and let us obviously kind of very general and broad and it's not true in every case, but I, I see it a lot. Um, and I've, I saw in Asian countries as well, he'll often, this is, you know, in the west, we like this in the east at, I mean I saw that in just as much in Asian countries as I did in, in the west.

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       And even in your monastic experience, you said, you know, there's gap at this time, eat this. But when we discussed it before, it was more like, look, let's eliminate as much as possible all the Ephemera of everyday affairs. So you can focus on awareness and compassion. Cultivate in these qualities. Yeah. But that itself is a form of structure, but it is in evidence that we go from Christ, the idea of Christ, of like, you know, abandoned your possessions and follow me. Don't get caught up in material world, loves everything. Don't judge nobody to write. I'm going to need cathedrals. Yeah. Like it's a sort of, it becomes materialized, institutionalized. And that is not about this essence is it? No. And that's what I, that's what really moved me and look is, is, is absolutely the same in, in all mystical schools, whether it's Christianity or Sufism of Islam.

Speaker 2:          00:48:42       Like you can find it in many in all the great traditions. But what really inspired me, you know, with the, the great yogis of Tibet, you know, they, they issued all that stuff. They didn't want anything to do with any kind of, not even the monasteries. They would just go to a cave in the mountains and they break it up and, and they'd have a little hole in one corner where they pass their waste out of. They'd have a little hole in the other corner where someone would come along every now and again and put some food inside and they would live their lives there and it was, it was free from all that kind of other stuff. And whilst on the one hand it's, it's not very kind of practical. I think on the other hand it created an environment where the focus and the intention was on the essence and the cultivation of the essence and the continuance of the essence through the ages rather than trying to create these greatest establishments that maybe kind of didn't necessarily kind of have to focus and intention on the, on the essence, no, their social structures and social structures tend to, the magnetism seems to be towards power.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       We talked before about polarity and concepts such as positive and negative and even these you issue the evening these, well I think from a meditation point of view they're, they're really challenging. So most of us will have a relationship with the mind where we kind of all with thoughts where we see some thoughts as positive and we see some thoughts as negative. So in doing that, we've already created a framework for tension and stress. If you know of positive thoughts come up, we want to hold onto them or you want to chase after them and if they look like they're going away, we get a little bit kind of nervous or we desire them so much that we chase after them. So we're caught up in that. If a negative thought comes up, we don't like it, we maybe we experience fear or were very resistant to it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       So we then kind of pushing against the thought. But when we then you'll know, you know, I'm sure you know this from your own meditation or when you, when you step back just a little bit, you know, a thought is a thought and if we don't engage with it, if we're able to kind of maintain that place, that seat of awareness where we simply witness a thought coming and going, it's a thought. It's neither good nor bad. It only becomes good or bad. Once we start to think about it in a certain way and once we start to have a relationship with it and to engage with it and to create a storyline around it, then it becomes problematic. But I thought in and of itself is neither is neither positive or negative

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       in a way for is the first layer of the material world.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       It's an object. Yeah. I I, yeah, I think that some, I mean there's always different ways of, of looking at it, but I feel like that's the first, the first, uh, normally the first place where we kind of get a bit caught up and where we start to experience suffering and stress in our life.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       Because even though like I've been meditating in seven years, transcendental meditation, I been listening to headspace and like, you know, I'm listening to the beginners bit, right? Cause it's free. I thought I Weiss of so odds but credit card number into something like, Oh God, no, this feels like a real commitment. But like, but like so, so, but even though like when I'm listening and then 10 minute ones, I'm like, bloody hell, this is for proper beginners, like Lard, recommend to mates and mine are out lights did in driveways and that guy look, listen to this, this will be of your meditation. But me, I've been meditating all this time and I still like, you know that right. You probably maybe wandered off now just returned back to the awareness of the rising and falling Nebraska and bloody oh, I am just saying yeah. Thinking again. Yeah. You know, he's sort of like, it's being stylish in this habit of the mind.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       Yeah. It's incredible, right? It's so ingrained and there's does this, um, sometimes this idea that, you know, your friends will say, oh, or people who meditate was how yeah, you went away and he did it for kind of so low, so low. We'll kind of, so what in a way it does, it doesn't mean that I no longer experience distraction of the mind. I think it, it is a practice and I, I really believe that none of us really kind of mastered is that maybe the odd few people like you know, people we've been chatting about today, but I feel like it is a, is a lifelong practice. He said journey for life and we're all students. We are always a student and if we ever lose that sense of not being a student, then we've lost that sense of freshness and curiosity and openness and beginner's mind, which I feel is so important in meditation. If we're not turning up with that, then it's just a routine. We just kind of going through the motion

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       assignment, think about little kids be in, you know, taken off right there. Maybe seven years old, they're 11 years old. It just seems extraordinary as a person who's grown up in the culture at I have that. That would even be an option. But I suppose, yeah, you think about it with football, you'd take off a six year old trough in some football academy, but the idea that you would an 11 year old would be capable of that and it shows you how much cultural experiences in the world knowable to, I think candy, that fear and desire, the constant triggers to action are so prevalent culturally that the news is promoting fear that commerce if rounds on desire, but these animalistic states a perpetuated that we need, uh, in, uh, an alternative if not oppositional force an ideology because the Po, the, the, the magnetism is powerful. The magnetism, the alternative is powerful. Yeah. I guess it depends how we,

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       and again, different viewpoints on it, but how we approached that. So if there's one idea, do we try and, do we try? I think very often you'll see one idea and you, she's in a, in American politics right now, there's one idea presented and then the other side they just shout a little bit kind of louder and then this side shouts louder. And then this side til eventually the kind of, you know, there's, there's so much kind of conflict and I guess there's a, there are different ways of coming at it and, and arguably the way of creating that alternative kind of route is rather than by trying to overthrow that in a kind of a, a physical or energetic kind of way, more kind of not engaging paps and creating an environment where that can't exist now. Because if all of us are, are living an open, present, compassionate kind of life, no one's going to vote for that. Yes. You know, so we, we enable, you know, I feel like the society enables that behavior. It doesn't necessarily, it's not necessarily, we're not necessarily slaves to it. We all kind of part of that and each and every one of us has a responsibility to sort of, you know, to, to be more present perhaps and not engage in it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       I think that's beautiful. I've heard that I did from various different sources, even quite, you know, anarchists and quite political people, right. People that are sort of progressive, uh, [inaudible] ideas of setting up societies that are independent, saying that don't engage in opposition Ism simply establish alternatives, established alternatives and living it. And when I think about them, two boys that was talking to yesterday were young men. Yeah. Like I think yeah, they are not going to want to like if you give them that right, here is a system. He was an alternative system. Like the way we can live in the world and we admit that the NAC is a woven material in it with consuming in it. We've where we acumen and we're frail and we we're flawed. Yeah. It doesn't, we don't have to live in the extremist state that are currently being offered.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       Even see that inside our own mind. Right. That we almost fanned the flames when we provide a lot of opposition or a lot of conflict. Like it doesn't, it keeps the thing alive. He know. So I worry sometimes that if the more we kind of push in one direction, actually the more sort of tension we create kind of coming back towards us. It's a bit like I Quito or something. You know, you, if the, if the force is coming towards you rather than push against it, just move to the side, let it go past, you know, there's something interesting in that kind of movement. Yeah. It feels like we plug into it. I think about bumper cars quite often that they know that we're these vehicles that have an area when it goes into the grid of negativity and anger. And if we just sort of unplug from that, then you're not being sourced by in the same way.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       And I do think we can live in the world, but choose not to be a part of that kind of thinking. I agree. Can I run for some of these questions that Garath Dan just selling, make sure that everything's covered. Uh, are you still in touch with teachers in Tibet, like your guru in that and who is your guru and you still study with him? Uh, I'm very much still in touch with them. I, you know, we were chatting just beforehand. I showed you a picture of our, it was really nice. I had a, uh, one of the, the abbots from the Tibetan monasteries. Um, my old retreat master, he came out and visited everybody's name out. He's La Llama. Yes. She ran pushy. Ah, cool. [inaudible] name, which is normally always impressed when I see them on a book. It's quite, quite high up. Those, those guys, they've done their, they've done their time and lane, he, he's not applying.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Um, and it was amazing. I was, I was so mad at you or they love you, they're happy or they seem really happy. And I was, I was genuine. It, that's probably one of the most magical special times for me personally, kind of in the whole headspace journey is having him come out here. Um, he spent a day with the whole team kind of, um, our, our annual retreat and um, and sort of know that it was his stamp of approval, but him coming out here, it kind of felt like, wow. Like that was really kind of meaningful cause it, you know, there is always the concern when you're trying to present something that has been so carefully kind of looked after. That's kind of traveled so many centuries, you know, of of messing with it. You know, and I, something I really calm, really care about.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       It's probably the thing I care about most. And so him coming out here and kind of saying this is, this is really kind of good for the world. That meant, yeah, I meant a huge amount. That's beautiful isn't it? Because that's one of the great challenges is how do we transfer it? Uh, people have, can't see, but you did it as if you were carrying a baby bird got to carry this thing is going to go in the wall. Precious, you know, and I think it's really easy to lose again, two and a half thousand years of r and d like, what's that? R and D is sort of research development kind of, you know, I feel like it'd be so easy to lose the efficacy in all the time and attention and precision that's gone into that over countless lifetimes. And so I don't want to be the person that messes that up, you know, come up with this thing. Add, reiterate. Then Andy there I got, what is it that like, what is it that, uh, what is the teaching of Buddha? And it's quite big question to come up with. Could you just sum that up, please end it. And I like him but like, cause this is is it's Buddhism. This headspace I genuine even as a Buddhist monk, I didn't um, self identify as Buddhist, um, and deluded may monitoring wrapped in a blanket. What did he think he was a hell's angel? Probably that's what you're going to be off to the circus.

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       I don't, I just don't call it as not helpful. I just think that the whole, the whole idea of, of meditation is letting go of labels and identity. So it was kind of ironic we then kind of take on and adopt the label of, of being a Buddhist or a Hindu or whatever it kind of might be. So I personally didn't find that terribly helpful way of thinking. Um, definitely. I, I personally, obviously I practiced those teachings for a very long time. They're very much kind of a part of my life and they absolutely a hundred percent influence kind of the content. Um, and a responsible for the content. [inaudible] it's in the APP, but I, I don't think about it as Buddhist. You know, we talked just now about the essence, the essence that is alive in every great tradition and every great culture. I feel like it is the delivery of the essence.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Um, so it's that as the chocolate without the wrapper. Yes. Yes. Imagine that if Jesus, Mohammed and Buddha met, they will not have a fight, but they ain't go no, fuck you. It's the same thing. It's hard to imagine. I quite like just be at that dinner though. What they talk. I mean, I wonder, yeah, like, uh, but like, yeah, ultimately you're right, the label people get hung up on the labels. People get hung up on the denominations. But I suppose like the, you know, coming from a Hindu tradition, the transformation of Buddhism was what exactly fair. Still a big question, isn't it? But like, what was it like suffering and desire? Watch out for that crap. I little bit of that, I think dude, um, the recognizing that, um, cause I'm trying to work out is that what happened to that man under that tree?

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       Yeah. Relevant to me now it feels like it is. Cause I again, I I think these things are, they're timeless. I think they're, they're universal. And it's really interesting, you know, you were talking about kind of attraction to, to, to the flesh and all those kinds of, to even if you read those stories, like it's not like he was there and he was experiencing this perfect mind and there were, there were no thoughts of desire or lost or greed or desire. All of that stuff was there. He was tempted was neen all sorts of forms and figures. I met him, he was picturing kind of beautiful naked women. And I don't feel like that's really such a kind of great leap away from where we are and have been most of us in, in our lives. It's just there was such a kind of a commitment to an intention to see those for what they were, you know, simply as thoughts and not real. And not permanent and not, and in, in

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       having that relationship and that perspective with his mind, with his thoughts, there was, there was a release and therefore, uh, a permanent at some stager, a complete freedom from the, the, the suffering of kind of our thinking mind. Yes. Is there some beautiful, beautiful stories I felt, um, like, like I said to you mate, when I left my wife and a daughter not permanently banned in the family just for a minute while I did this at Abbot Kinney and wander around there on the short walk, I felt like the thought occurred, I am already dead. You are already dead. Everything that happens to you, it's meaningless. Now those are thought you get get often. No, not really, but it gets off the light. I get versions of like, I think it exists to, uh, to mitigate the for that there's some thing to acquire, to attain. I'm very much a person that's I'm objective, fixated.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       Like I think I must do this. I must get that, you know, cause even when you sort of like that when people do at in enlightenment, cause I took psychedelics when I was younger, I recognize it cause I've shortcutted it sometimes when you get that feeling of self immolation and the idea of like, oh my God, I'm not real. I remember like I was 16 year old kid, I took acid. We've just like lads from now as it turned out like the Yorkshire, like tripping and like, and I remember, Oh my God, I'm not a person. I'm not a person. I know like I remember realizing it and feeling it and like it's terrifying because you are, there's no, we don't have any tradition. There's nothing to tell you that there's no one's going all right, this is just this temporary thing. You're going to be here for a brief while, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       So, yeah, those thoughts occur to me and have always occurred to me and I've always had, uh, I've found something in me that does make me think that past life or some version of that or interconnected consciousness in some form maybe a deal because it like often thinks, seem familiar. Often things seem attractive to me in ways that are, you know, like you spoke of your own instinct, your own intuition. You decided at some point I'm mafia to go to the Himalayas. Like, what's that? Oh, I'm going to go and study with this guy. You know, who is that? Who's that? That speaking? Who is me and like Adam Curtis on the early guests on this podcast goes, the problem of our time now is there's someone in our air, you know, the pink floyd lyric. There's someone in my head and it's not me. There's someone talking inside your own mind and that's not who you are.

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       I've got to do this. I'm going to buy that. I'm going to have a fight, aren't going to perhaps that you know, you've become identified, commodified condition, the trained to behave in a way that you are now completely detached from this essence, this essence that you talk about this awareness and compassion who have no relationship with it anymore. Don't know that it's there. And that's, that's the interesting thing for me. I think the, and I agreed that the risk is that we think that it's, that it's elsewhere. If we think it's not there or not here, then we might start to think

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       that it exists elsewhere. And, and I would contend that actually it is here and he is with each and every one of us all of the time. It's never anywhere else. It's just that maybe we don't have a sense of connection with it or we don't have a familiarity with it. And I feel that's the struggle. And a lot of people come to meditation rather than kind of allowing sort of the clouds the past to experience the blue sky. There's more of a sense of, okay, right, I've got to experience blue sky. How do I push all those clouds out of the way and how do I kind of create this space? Like what I think meditation is rather than just allowing a natural process to unfold. So I, despite, you know, whatever's going on in the world and whatever people are doing and saying, I think for all of us or this is something I find really kind of useful is, is knowing that look, awareness and compassion is still there for whatever reason, the circumstances that conditioning the environment as not necessarily allowed that to shine through.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       But it is there and it's there in each and every one of us. I really sort of profoundly kind of believe, believe that's the case. Clearly. Willie, can we conclude with some meditation? There are other questions, but you know, they're not as interesting as the idea of ass though. Great questions. Gaff, tape be hurt. Like they've got like a like should we, can we conclude the call meditation? We do a bit. Yeah. Yeah. If you'd like to. Oh, nice one. Yeah. Couple of minutes. Good or, yeah. Yeah, a couple of minutes. Great. I mean you're the bloody expert. I, I'm really not. Let me decide.

Speaker 2:          01:06:49       Coke, I don't think, I don't think there's ever been, um, have ever been done in this particular right. Won't help us. Okay. So know whether it's just us. I sort of is. Anyone who wants to kind of join him when they're, when they're listening to this, you know, just um, general bit of advice. Just make sure that you're sitting comfortable and you're not going to be disturbed for just a couple of, a couple of minutes. It doesn't matter if there's a bit of noise going on in the background, but just taking a moment, always when you first sit down, just a, just to ground the body, so just feel the weight of the body against the chair or the floor beneath you. Soles of the feet on the floor and the weight of the hands and the arms just resting on the legs and you can start off with your eyes open, eyes closed, whatever feels kind of more comfortable. But if you have your eyes open, just drive your camera. Other than to focus on one particular point, just have a nice kind of spacious, relaxed focus. It's sort of just takes in the entire sort of space around you so you can't really see any one thing in focus. You just see everything around you and just maintaining that soft focus. Just tell you a couple of big deep breaths. Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth. Just one more time. Breathing in through the nose,

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       announce for the mouth, and as you breathe out this time just gently closing the eyes and just feeling that weight again, pressing down. Allow any thoughts to just come and go. The mine's going to continue to think. Don't try to stop any thoughts, just bringing the attention into the body. I'm just noticing how the body feels. Is there a sense of heaviness or lightness in the body? Does it feel like there's a sense of stillness or restlessness in the body? So not trying to change anything. Just noticing the feeling, that sensation and as you sit there, just starting to notice how the body's breathing. So again, we're not trying to breathe in any special way. Sometimes the breath will be quick. Sometimes it's slow, sometimes it's deep, sometimes it's shower. Just let it do its own thing.

Speaker 3:          01:09:39       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:09:40       To begin with, just noticing where in the body you feel that movement might be. The stomach won't be the chest, you can't fit anything. Just gently placing your hand on the stomach just to feel that movement as you follow the breath. Just the help to to remain focused on that feeling, that sensation. Just starting to count the breaths just silently to yourself. So as you fill the rising sensation, it count one falling sensation two and three and four just up to a count of 10. You starting again at one. Just try that a couple of times through on your own. So for sure at some stage the mind's going to get distracted. Soon as you realize the mind's wandered, just gently acknowledging it, letting the thought co and then just coming back to the brain. And just for a moment,

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:11:51       letting go nav even any focus on the breath. So just letting the mind for a few seconds. Do whatever it wants to do. It wants the thing that I think just allowing the mind to be free and then just gently bringing the attention back into the body that's coming back to that feeling of contact of weight coming back into the space around you. Any sounds, sensations, and then when you're ready, just gently open the eyes again. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       Ah, that was good because it was mad 12th my and like you were there. Oh, hello. I'm there all the time there. It's that man for that team guys in here as well. And that was amazing. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       The idea that it is always there, the awareness and compassion is always there. Obfuscated only by men or static and external attachment, which can be overcome with the learning of these techniques. Well done in your incredible work in big team. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. You know, you've been very clear that you work with a great many people and that you're part of a lineage in a yeah. In both directions laterally and back for the time. Hopefully forwards as well.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       Yeah. Hopefully unless you, this finally ruined. I mean, is it good chance? We'll see what happens between us. You can destroy all religion. There's nothing left. But the thing, I'll do the board and then we'll branch out, branch out. Christianity. Islam will leave. I was involved with that, but hey, nice one. Thanks. Right. It's an honor to have you for having me on, man. Thank you. Thanks for letting us record in your studio. Um, the, so yeah, download the headspace. Learn to meditate free yourself. Free Yourself. Cheers mate. Thanks man. Nice one. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       Yes.
