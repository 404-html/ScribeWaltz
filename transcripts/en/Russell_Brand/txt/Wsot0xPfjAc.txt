Speaker 1:          00:00          My accent changes, I'm terrible, may bounce up and down that class ladder like little trees, football in La, like when I'm around like sort of like my girlfriend really torments me for life. She's like, how much I love working class men. Like when we went to think it was called Jewsons to pick up some gravel. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that that's my life. And there's this bloke there called mark and he came over and wanted to fight ots. You laughed at that episode when it a photo and I was not a lot and I said goodbye to him in an overly elaborate way. Can I even wave to him a second time for another apartment? Cherry out the window. No, actually I think I might turn off, but you don't sit at my. Oh, I taught our pal. Good solid of Alpha power. The tomato sauce, guidestar.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Bloody Cockney. It's absolutely ridiculous. What's going on? Well, that's exactly why we change our voices. Uh, interestingly, the more we know this study, we have to change our voices to talk to somebody. So soon as we started talking to each other without agreeing to do so, we started to breathe together because you have to do that is have a conversation. You have to coordinate how you breathe because that lets you time voices going back and forth, the turn taking conversation. So physical, it really is. And we also matched the pros, the pitch and precedent by voices and the rhythm of our voices. We start to bring together, because you've got this very rhythmic. He's like, he's like a dance conversation and you can only do that dance if you start to align your behavior. So that has to happen to talk. And then the more you like someone, the more you will start to do other things, to change your voice, to bring it towards them. So there are studies that have shown that the more a man likes a woman, well he will raise the pitch of his voice to be nearer to hers, just notes. And everybody's super self conscious about

Speaker 2:          01:44          right.

Speaker 1:          01:48          And you believe that you'll start to use the same words. You start to use the same pronunciation jeep and start to use the same grammar as each other and the and the more you like. The most communication is here. That's the whole point of it is that we're trying to make a connection with one another. We're trying to defy the material prison of our anatomy. You're feeling trapped and it's the voice. This thing that is not really holy or truly Uba vibration emanating from you. That is your misery that you've sent out in the world to make connections and communication with God. I'm good at this and I'm just making this shit up, but it's always there. So it's always expressing like a lot of you that you don't realize and it's also expressing how you feel about the people that you're talking to fairly unavoidably.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Oh No. I'm going to start watching myself back on track because one day Sundays we do a bit of funny bit in my standup show, right? Where I talk about when we did this interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of the things that we make jokes about, I'm going to buy way. I mean me because. Because I'm mentally ill, I consider myself for about nine people might actually have people at work with her in the room I'm like, is that I love about how I go through these different personas when dealing with Jeremy Paxman, they start very light and affable. Then I got really serious and then I get very sort of either deliberately or not deliberately, but unconsciously referencing ethnic speak rhythms. Yeah, very working class based because I obviously see myself as speaking on behalf of outsiders and I use it as an attack technique. It's very interesting to watch and your marketing because we can mark similarity with it. You can mark difference because. Yeah, right. Because I'm definitely not try. I don't go. I knew I'd have to say. I'm like, no, listen, I'll take you down. It's like ridiculous. It's like a grime single, but it's. It's still playing your apps, your eyes marking out your position to him as clearly and how you're doing that. What you're saying. I'm not like, I don't particularly want to be you, God. I'm just telling my cell phone.
