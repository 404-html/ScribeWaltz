Speaker 1:          00:00:00       My guests on under the skin today is Dr. Jordan Peterson. Clinical psychology is professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and author of books including maps of meaning, the architecture of belief. And He's recent bestseller 12 rules for life. First garnering mainstream media attention in 2016 when he objected to compelled speech legislation in Canada. He has steadily been making a name for himself as a voice of the anti political correctness movement and has cultivated a slew of predominantly young male followers, touted by some as an academic rockstar. And the most important thinker in the west and by others as a provocateur. And firebrand of the alt right is also part of a new Internet savvy group of controversial thinkers that have been deemed the intellectual dark web Jordan Peterson. And thank you for coming on under the skin. Thanks very much for the invitation. I, I'm excited to speak to you because my interest in your work was either prior to or somehow abstract from the controversies that have brought you to mainstream attention. And I said, I was thinking then as a clinical psychologist, I was wondering about the how, uh, interwoven the relationship between psychology and, and mythology and archetypes is,

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       well, one of the things that happened I think was the, when the political scandal broke around me in Canada, which was in September, 2016 people came to check me out because of the scandal, but they stayed because of the psychology. By that time I already had about 300 hours of youtube lectures, which probably saved me in some sense because when I was being protested against say and worn by the university about what I was doing, because it was hypothetically contravening the law people went on my site to find out what sort of person I was. And I had pretty much everything I'd said to students in the last 30 years taped and, and ready for per what public viewing. My website had already had about a million hits then. And um, people got very interested in the psychology and it's not surprising to me because what I've been teaching since 1993 is I think unbelievably practical.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       You know, I'm clinical psychologist so I've always been interested in trying to improve people's mental health. And I viewed putting the lectures online as a, as part and parcel of that. It's like there were a lot of smart clinicians in the 20th century. They learned a lot about how you could put your life together, decrease anxiety, decreased depression or in yourself more effectively in your communication and with regards to your longterm plans and understand your dreams and position yourself properly in the world. And it's been a real pleasure and a privilege to be able to bring that work to the broader attention of wealth. Now it's millions of people. It's not surprising. It helps, you know, I mean these people were geniuses. So the fact that, talking about what Freud, Freud, young Karl Adler, Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, there's a slew of existential cycle psychologist, the 1950s humanists in the 1960s. There's, there's probably a dozen or so, maybe 15 of great clinicians who laid the groundwork really for clinical psychiatry and also for clinical psychology. And they and, and also develop well developed psychotherapy and therapeutic conversations as we know it,

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       like a emergent myths. It must bear the inflection of the culture in which it was conceived. Uh, this is why I am particularly interested in the areas of psychiatry and psychology that are resourced from, uh, uh, older materials such as a methodology in architecture. And I know that particularly in, in the, some of the names that you mentioned, mythology I used as a car to a supply, a common language. Yeah. Well, and that's,

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       that's the right way of looking at it to some degree. It's like people, we act out stories. That's why we tell stories, right? That's why people are attracted to stories because stories are the best way of describing our lives. And stories have a pattern or they wouldn't be stories. I mean, that's why there's comedy, right? That's where everything turns out the way everyone wants it too. That's why there's tragedy when everything falls apart. That's why there's adventure and romance and that covers a lot of territory, right? Adventure, Romance, comedy, tragedy, and you know, people like Carl Young in particular, he was, he was the deepest analyst of stories, I would say. Um, there's a Romanian guy named Murcia, Eliana, who was also a very historian of religions who was also very remarkable scholar and very useful if, if you're interested in understanding the fundamental patterns of stories.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       But young was very interested in the deepest structure of stories. Imagine that humans have languages. Every human culture has a language, but languages have a commonality, right? They're all languages. And they have a universal grammar. That was, that was a noam Chomsky's great discovery. Yes. And stories are like that. Every culture has its own stories, but the stories have a universal grammar. And so when was the first person who, who laid the groundwork for, for, for discovering what that universal grammar was. And it's crucially important work. No, you could say that. What a religious a religion is. Is it a religion is a set of stories that comes very close to the grammar of stories so and so there aren't, they aren't stories that you can dispense with hero stories like that

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       you say did great early work in mapping out what might be the etymology or the sort of the Lt rhea truth from which these patterns emerge? Yep. Um, my interest, this is that it

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       that cause look either when you're works with image and Mandela in say for example, the red book for it's that what it's what is suggested by our ability to observe patterns and the fact that we respond to patterns is that there is that there is some kind of universal frequency that we are responding to. I had two clients who knew nothing about union psychotherapy, both of whom were badly fragmented. They were both women. They both had, I would say variants of post traumatic stress disorder. They had other problems as well. And both of them produced spontaneous drawings that were first very fragmented and disorganized. And then as they put themselves together and we're ordering themselves, let's say they produce drawings that were increasingly symmetrical and regular and took on the Mandela like configurations that young described. And so that was absolutely fascinating to watch that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       And he thought of those patterns as manifestations of spontaneous order and you'll see them in cathedrals. Yes, the great rose windows and cathedrals are Mandelas and the rose windows and the entire cathedral structure is something like, it's hard to describe exactly, but a cathedral is something like the optimal balance of structure and light. It's something like that. And the gothic cathedrals are also reminiscent of forests, right? With their, with their arching branches and the light's coming through like the light coming through the leaves. It's reminiscent of that. But there's something about the cathedral that expresses the idea of perfect structure and there's something about a Mandela that expresses that and something about music that expresses that as well. And it's all, they're all ways of trying to symbolically represent how things could be if they were put in the proper state of balance. Harmony, harmony is the right way of thinking money.

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       Harmonies. I suppose all of these forms, the idea that there could perhaps be across the various disciplines, Straw or informs and expression, some kind of golden rule seem to infer a oneness, a truth that in earlier forms of language may be expressed as the idea of God, wholeness, oneness. Uh, w where the, what did he stand on the idea, I do believe in God. Well, the union idea is that, that there's not much distinction between what young described as the archetype of the self and the idea of God and the self would be something like that. The totality of your being across time, young thought of Christ as a symbol of the self and the reason for that, which is a very profound idea. It's an amazingly profound idea. Go and unpack it. Well, you can, if you think about the, the story of Christ from a psychological perspective, what, and, and you strip it down to its essence, what you essentially see is that the story of Christ is the ultimate tragedy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       And the reason for that is that the ultimate tragedy is the worst possible happening to the best possible person. Right? That's the ultimate tragic, that's what makes it an archetype. You can't go past that for tragic, right? So it's an innocent man who was completely sinless, who was working on behalf of, of, of only the good and the truth. Broken and destroyed early and young and betrayed as well. So that's the ultimate tragedy. And so then, and then there's a, there's a common, a comedic element to it in the technical sense, cause a comedy has a happy ending. Clay wouldn't even require a full in a light for the, for the, for, for it to work immediately. There would need to be a flow in Christ. Is it that he has God made flesh? Is that the floor? Well, there it depends on what you mean by comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       I mean we, we tend to as modern people to think of comedy as something that's humorous. But technically if you're looking at story structure or comedy is just a story that has a happy ending, right? That has a positive ending and that source, it's The resurrection story that makes Christ's story a car, a comedy. Tada. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. This went so badly wrong. But there's this possibility of resurrection and the way that I read that psychologically, and I'm not trying to make any comments about the metaphysics of it, is that there's a part of people that's the self, the young self, let's say cap the SLV council as self. Yes. That that is capable of sustaining itself across success of deaths and rebirths and everyone really understands this. It's one of the things that's most fun to teach people because you know when, when you're moving through life and you have a plan or a dream and it shatters, you know, someone dies or a relationship breaks apart or you, you have a terrible upset in your career or you become ill in some unexpected way that everything around you falls apart and you plunge into a while, you plunge into a chaotic underbelly of the way.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       That's exactly right. Yes, exactly that. And then you, maybe you stay there because it isn't necessarily the case that people get out. You know, people die. People are in despair permanently, but frequently something tragic and terrible be false. You and you fall apart and you learn something profound as a consequence. And you put yourself back together and when you come back out, you're more than you were when you went in. And that's happening at a small scale. Every time you learned something, you know, you, if you ever really learned something, it's usually painful. It usually means that you have to recognize that you're wrong in some important way. You have to let that part of you that's wrong, die. And then you have to let a new part of you, okay. So the self, imagine that you undergo a series of transformations in your life.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       There are, there are collapses into the chaotic underworld and then red mini resurrections that happens continually. And that's what molds your character is his self, is this thing that manages the transformations across all those across, that manages all those transformations. So you could say, here's another way of thinking about it. He could identify with what you understand. That's what idiot logs do. You could identify with you dealt with what you don't understand and that's what sort of seekers after truth, um, uh, identify with, or you could identify with the process of moving between those states. You know, sometimes you know what you're doing, you know where you are, you, you're, you're in control and, and, and you can become arrogant and identify without, and then become too static about it. Right? Or you can be in despair and everything is chaotic and you all can identify with that, in which case you're not allistic. Or you can view yourself as the thing that moves across the transformations and that's, that's the right way to, to, to conceptualize yourself as you're, the thing that maintains constancy across transformations.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       One imagines that your experience, uh, with the controversies around the, uh, linguistics and legislation in Canada must have felt like one of those plunges into the depths on some level. Would you say, did you, did you feel a sense of personal tragedy and fear and a concern about consequence or that there may be no way back that it could represent a kind of death or did it indeed represent a kind of death for you, for one for which you are subsequently grateful?

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       Well, I would say for the first four months when the political scandal broke, it was very unsettling for a variety of reasons. The first was that my occupation as a clinical psychologist and as a professor was definitely in doubt. I mean, the university sent me two warning letters and that's standard hr procedure. Usually you get three, right? The third warning is stop or their consequences won't be good. If you work in human resources, you have to, especially if you're going to go after someone with tenure, you have to document their misbehavior. You have to provide them with warnings. You have to tell them how they could get back on the right track, and then if you have documented refusal to comply with the warnings, then they have grounds for dismissal.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       You were close, you were close. You were close today. Yeah, to some kind of personal or professional annihilation or certainly damaged. Now those for a bit, just in case on the off chance that there are people that are unaware of the d hours. I'll say it as I understand it and then you can tell me I've got it wrong. The government changed the law say and that there are neutral nouns that will be mandatorily would be applied to people that identify as transgender. You said that is an imposition on freedom of speech. Whilst I would make a decision whether or not I would, if I was meeting a transgender person, I would talk to them how they want it to be talked to. The fact that you're making it law is an impediment on the freedom of speech and then kicked

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       off. Yeah, that's, that's a, that's a good summary of it. Yeah. I would say, I mean my sense there were two things are objected to. One was that the government for the first time in the history of Canada and really in a move that was unprecedented in English common law under English common law actually mandated the content of voluntary speech and I thought, I don't care what your excuse is for doing that. That's no go zone. Far as I'm concerned. That's not happening

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       even though, right. This is what it seems to me like sort of helped me to understand this one because, well, I'm always interested in I think is power and where power is. Yeah. Like you know, subsequently look what your views are towards that sort of poststructuralist and the ot left and like a lot of things I think. Yeah, you're right. That though, you know, I, I agree with that, but what, but what I, the reason I think that the sort of the controversy had fuel on both sides. The reason it had an engine on the other side is because it seems that, uh, and indeed having watch I've interviews and the objections that other interviewers have presented to you, it seems to me that like, it seems that our transgender person is in a position of vulnerability, but you are saying this is not about transgender, this is about language and it's about oppression. That's what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       That was my claim is that this wasn't about transgenderism at all. And Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       I'm about mate. You've got no strong view, I'm guessing or,

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       um, I don't, I don't have the sort of strong view that I would, what, think I was sufficiently qualified to make political statements about,

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       yeah. Lecture. Kyle goes, I don't understand it, but she's not my boy, basically. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       Look at the research. You know what I mean? The research for transgendered kids is quite clear, is that most of them deceased by the time they're 18, you know, and I'm basically guided by,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       wait, does he know Scandinavia where they check that stuff out? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. No, people have criticized that research, like all research, but it's the best research that's been done on the topic. But on the other problem was with the legislation was that I felt that it was an attempt by the radical left to gain the linguistic territory and to define that the terms of the debate, you know, and, and I thought that was very dangerous, so I was objecting to that as well.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       Phil, you never will. The thing that I'm interested in here, Jordan, is I don't feel like the radical left is a very powerful group. Am I being naive here? I mean possibly in the world of academia that I feel like they are sort of representative of a coalition bill around identity politics issues that would seem particularly important to people. Like my general view is if you identify something, call no problem. It sounded my business. That's basically my opinion. I'll, I'll call you what you want me to call you. I'm happy that you're speaking to me, but like, but like, but like, but do you see as sort of of the uh, sort of the sort of extreme left or as a powerful organization like certainly in the universities he said, well they can get what done they could for example, they'll get that legislation passed.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       Yes. That the woman, I think the situation is different in the u s than it is in other countries. I think the political situation in the u s is actually more balanced than it is in most western countries because I would say the, the left, the radical left has a, has a pretty decent hold on a number of institutions and, and first and foremost of those would be the universities. But then the conservatives, you know, aren't without power in the United States because they occupied most of the elected positions. Now do you use it, but it's not the case in Canada. You didn't want to be identified with any of those groups, am I right? Like you wouldn't say that you're a person that's on the right or the left or conservative or really, I know she didn't say whether or not you believed in God. Well, my political views are complicated because I'm temperamentally liberal cause I'm pieing openness, which is a creativity dimension. People who are high in openness tend to be liberal because they liked free flowing information and they like, uh, what would you say? Fluid boundaries because information can move back and forth across the boundaries. So reject like that

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       ideologically you reject to these taxonomies and you identify basically on the bay on the basis of research like empiricism. In a sense you could say like you know, I'm an open minded type of person. This language is clinical psychology, so really your faith is clinical psychology.

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       Well I've done a fair bit of research in my lab on yes, the temperamental predictors of political predisposition and we can predict what parties people are going to align themselves with by studying their personality. So liberal types, liberal left types are high and the trait called openness and open people here are very open person and you can tell because you think laterally, you know you have an idea and then it reminds you of a whole bunch of other ideas and so you'll move laterally across ideas and a more conservative person, they'll stay within the category, you know? And so your, your conversational style is is mark, bye bye divergences. That's, that's actually called divergent thinking. It's a hallmark of great, good. Well it's good if you want to be creative. The problem with them, there's a price for everything. Hey, the price for creativity is that it's hard to catalyze an identity because you're interested in everything.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       That's the first thing and your interest, we'll flip from one thing to another. So one of the problems that creative people have while they have two, one is they have a hard time establishing an identity. And the second is they have a hard time monetizing their creativity. It's very difficult to be a creative person and make money. You can make money for other people, but usually your dad by then, so it's not very helpful for you do it. And both of those problems, uh, as a result of external structures, the imposition of external structures on the individual iee make money. That's a problem of capitalism and you know, commerce more broadly.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       And uh, the other one of identity similarly, you know, so there is, is there a sort of a peculiar contradiction in, uh, uh, around identity in that like it seems to me on one level that you reject taxonomies. So you're saying that these systems, eeg, if you say women are being paid less money, your argument would be, well, hold on a minute. There are other factors other than Jack Gender it here. I exactly agree with the data.

Speaker 2:          00:20:28       It's a funny thing because the intersectional feminists always, uh, always claimed that you should take other factors into account. Right? Woman man isn't enough. Yeah. Black isn't enough when I say, well there's a, there's a pay gap between men and women, but it's not only do due to gender, it's due to all sorts of things and you have to take them into account. So it's an intersection of argument.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       So it's quite funny that I get hell for it. He's an intersectional argument. So unlike, so do you feel that, cause what I sent you happening, like trying to understand where like our worldviews would align where potentially there would be opposition between you and I? Well, I'm trying to think cause it seems to be looking at your work, you said, oh I don't agree with the way that this information is being compiled. I don't agree with the assumptions that you're trying to saddle that piece of data with. It seems to me that it's about critical thinking and very post structuralist idea, you know? Um, but it also, what I have noticed is that much of your, many of your theories seem to be subsequently, uh, Lloyd to some unpleasant ideas around there's sort of tradition and conservatism, oppression even. How do you feel about that? Cause like, you know, like it would be like, it'd be well easy for you to laugh. I think you have said, I don't care about whether pete was transgender or not. I just don't want no oppressive laws around language builders. It'd be easy if you'd say, I don't think there's any, you know, I've heard you say on the news, fairness, fairness, but it does seem that there was some mischief somehow in near around the issues such as gender inequality,

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       mischief and me, Rhonda, all sorts of things. But I think that mostly I look at the political landscape from the perspective of a informed biologically oriented social scientists. And so when people lay out their particular theories, um, they don't sound, they don't sound outdated to me. Like one example is that the left, for example, tends to lay the blame for inequality at the feet of the western hierarchical structure and capitalism. And that's just wrong. Equality inequality is a problem and it's the proper concern of the left, I would say. And it's a proper concern because inequality is a deadly problem, but it's way more serious than anything you can blame on capitalism. Every single society that's ever been studied for as far back as people are able to study suffers from the problem with inequality. This, I work with this native American tribe in, in, in northern Vancouver. I'm a member of the tribe actually now they're called the [inaudible] people. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       say that again, that's not sort of like I have to say much qua qua qua qua qua wok. Oh, I see. Yeah. Tough bear for their native language. Right. Tough one to spell cause I would probably with me is would say too many class

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       then they're brick. They're, they're brilliant artists. They're part of that west coast native tradition of art, which I think is a great tradition. Is that, um, well exaggerated eyes. I want, it's Hulu. It's kind of a hallucinogenic art in some sense. And these family, the animals are very, are, are very, uh, uh, graphic. They're very graphically portrayed, I would say they have large almond eyes and bright colors and um, the arts fared beautiful. The hideout art is probably the best known, very intense. But the Kwakwaka'Wakw is, is similar to that. So they used to have this ceremony called the potlatch. And what you would do in a potlatch is usually you have to be comparatively wealthy to have a part latch and you would give away everything you had. And that was their solution to inequality because what would happen in the native societies, just like every other society, is that as time progressed everything would become owned by a very small number of people. And that's a bad recipe for longterm stability. So they would have these giant parties that would often last weeks where the rich would demonstrate their wealth. And also, I suppose their commitment to their own provision, their own capacity to provision the future by giving everything away. But, and I'm only using that as an example to show that the problem of inequality, it's not something that you can lay at the feet of capitalism. It's a way worse problem than that. I agree with you and I understand, uh, but you're saying that

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       capitalism occurs far too late down the line to be the genesis a problem that's indigenous to the but what about some of these like, you know, and I would be very careful to like the, you know, I don't know. I'm saying I believe in God, I believe in God, but like I wouldn't politically, I would be a little more cautious about saying why I agree with this pilot boat. Cause I sort of don't feel that my political views are demonstrated within the sphere of mainstream politics because they operate on such a prohibited frequency because of the, yeah, the power of Trans National Organizations, the irrelevance of national sovereignty when it comes to ordinary people asserting power. So, you know, it becomes sort of kind of too complex for me. But what I can see is interesting about, so you know even if you take a sort of socialism and perhaps you know like the, I suspect or sense that one of the issues you take is it sort of continual annihilation of likes it take first, take out God, then take out man and take out woman, then take out everything to all we have is this miasma of meaninglessness.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       I wouldn't necessarily put that at the, well, I wouldn't necessarily put it in read the socialism

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       per se. What would you say that is? Well that's a complicated one. I mean it happening or did it? Am I wrong? I think, I think it's happened in many ways. I think a lot of that is a consequence of the hypothetical conflict between science and religion. Do you think that's hypothetical? What would be, because I'm not so sure there is a conflict. There will look their materialism and spiritual fundamental conflict because the world is one thing fundamentally, right? Everything fits together so there can't actually be a conflict. If the religious realm exists in the scientific realm exists, they have to be unifiable at some point. Now the more materialistic scientists or the what the more atheistic scientists types like Sam Harris would deny essentially that there's any validity to religious dogma. Although he certainly believes that there's a element to life. So I think that what happened, at least in part, and this is why the work of Yom to return to yoga so important is that we, we weren't, we didn't understand that truth comes in different forms depending on its application.

Speaker 2:          00:27:01       It's a tricky thing. There's the truths that apply when you're attempting to describe the transformations of the material world and there's the truths that apply when you're trying to determine how it is that you should act while you're alive. And those, obviously those have to come into alignment, but they're not in alignment right now. And my sense, and this is the sense that's being developed at least in part from reading the great psychoanalysts, is that fictional accounts, Mehta, fictional accounts, even like biblical comps, which are mythological our stories about how it is that people should act. Not Stories about what the material structure of the world is like. This is also where the fundamentalists have it wrong as far as I'm concerned. Because the fundamentalists like to think that the, the account in genesis is a scientific theory. It can be stacked up against other scientific theory.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       She'll, they are materializing the mythic. Yes, that's right. And this says I'm helpful. Well, it's not a help. Well, first of all, it's not, it doesn't even make any sense because the materialist types in any real sense weren't around until about 500 years ago. Right. And this was all satisfy like cart and the cart and, and uh, um, bacon and, well, Galileo was another player, but those were the two. The two major players established the scientific method. There weren't scientists before then. I mean, there were very intelligent people who could analyze the structure of the world. The ancient Greeks were obviously very rational and capable of philosophy, but there was no science until 500 years ago. And so obviously the people who wrote genesis word scientists, because there weren't any scientists, so whatever. And I also think that the, the world they describe is much more, it's much better considered the world of experience than the world of material reality.

Speaker 2:          00:28:45       And well, look here, here's an idea. You, you can, you can try this one on for size. I've been trying this on audiences for quite a long time. So modern people say they think the world is made out of things, but if you watch them, that's not how they act. They act like the world is made out of potential. And so they'll even say things to each other like, you're not living up to your potential. You might say, well, what is this potential that you're talking about? You can, it doesn't have a color. It doesn't have a shape. It doesn't have a mass. It doesn't have a size. Like there's nothing about it that's, it has a material, a material element. Yet you believe that you're not living up to your potential. Everyone feels guilty about that. If someone accuses you, if that you feel bad about it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       So then I might say, well, you also live not as if you confront a world of things, but as if you confront a world of possibility and you hold each other accountable that way. Cause I could say, well, you're not making all the use of the possibility that's presented to you because you're not living, you're not living. Honestly. You're not aiming high enough. You're not making everything of that potential that might be made. It's what's that potential? Well, in religious stories, that potential, and you see this in the first story in genesis, is that potential is what God creates order out of at the beginning of time. That's the idea that's expressed in that book is that there's a potential, whatever that is, and that something acts on it to bring it into reality. And there's a deeper idea in there too, which, which is a profound idea, which is that the potential, the actuality that you bring out of potential with truth is good.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       And so there's an ethical element to the story as well. And I actually think that that's, that's a great truth. I do believe that's the case, that the reality you bring out of potential with truth is good. And I think that's one of the most, that's one of the most profound discoveries of humanity. The ability to articulate that idea was articulated in the first chapter in Genesis to brilliant idea that's associated with the idea that human beings are made in the image of God because God is that which calls reality into being out of potential. But each of us do that as well in a small way. That seems to me to just be true.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       Of course, all the things that are in the manifest world where once unmanifest, right, and many of the things that are unmanifest now will become manifest and we could choose that to some degree. We have agency. Well, we seem to treat each other like

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       we do. Yeah, well, you know, if I treat you like you don't have agency, you don't like it. It's not the grounds for a, for a satisfactory longterm relationship.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       While we were in the Old Testament, I want to ask you something because you want to pick a job that seems right up your alley. I looked at this book, I can't remember about any more. You may even know specs that you, you will, it was a book of engravings from the Book of job by the British writer and poet William Blake. Blake had done the series of engravings based on the trials and tests that Joe went through in these, in these series of engravings. Yourway and Joe, I, y'all way and joe are depicted as a sort of identical, you know, the ones in a celestial realm once in a terrestrial realm and the beginning of the image. But Joe and his family are depicted in front of the tree of life, the instruments hanging in the trees. The animals are sleeping by the end of the image after these various trials, you know, after Joe has been tested this, and we were to assume, I suppose that there's been this journey of self, capital s realization.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       I mean, uh, of a, through these trials, uh, the, the instruments are being played to the animals are awake, you know, and there's a sort of a bright future in this sense of astronomical stuff I either position in at the sun and moon is somehow meant to be significant also. And the person that wrote this book, he's a union. Now, the thing that struck me deep, deep, deep, and I've been struggling with it ever since, is there's a moment where Yar way shows the behemoth and the to job. And he says, these I made is I made the right. And then in this union analysis of these engravings, the writer says that God requires of us, that we be good, that goodness itself may exist, that there is a something beyond, but it's comparable to neutrality in God, the Creator, the idea of God, the creator, the image of the behemoth and the Leviathan in these engravings is terrifying. The animalism of the bacchae empathy, it's Musculature, its rawness, the Leviathan, sneaky, dark, deep, terrifying thing. This idea of agency and got this relationship between the unmanifest and the manifest as achieved through an individual's relationship with truth and expression seemed to me that it was saying something that was right on the precipice of my ability to understand and sandy to convey.

Speaker 2:          00:33:36       Okay. So the first thing I would say as well, one of the indications that you're open is the way that you phrased that question cause there's like 30 things happening in that question all at the same time. And one of the things that creative people do is they throw out like images and cause your, your, your question was full of images. There's, you're trying to map territory that you don't understand. You say here's an image and here's an image and here's the new bridge and here's an image. And there's something uniting all of those. But I don't know what it is. It's like, well that's what artists do by the way. And so that's a preliminary mapping of unexplored territory. And so we could take that apart a little bit. I mean, one of the things, so joe is objecting to his treatment because of course God has a bet with the devil basically, that he can take job down and make them curse fate.

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       He basically bets the devil that he can turn job into Kaine and God says, no, no, you God says no, you the devil bets God that he can turn job indicate by tormenting him and God says, no jobs a good man. No matter what you do to him, he won't lose faith in being. That's essentially the bat. And you think, well that's a hell of a thing for God to do. But then, and job objects to God to some degree and he's got his reasons, man. I mean cause everything's taken away from him and God says, I made these things, the Leviathan. So that's like the terrible element of nature. And I made the bay a moth and maybe you could say that's the terrible element of society. It's like how dare you question me? And that's a perfectly reasonable objection. It's like really? You're good at it doesn't matter what happens, you're going to question God really well.

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       So God objects to that and then and then you, you, you, you will, although job young believed that job actually had the moral upper hand in that description because God behaved rather reprehensive Lee and having a bet with the devil. I mean young wrote a book called answer to job, which is very much worth reading. It's quite a profound piece of work. But then you also woven into the question this idea of the ethical requirement to be good. Yes, there's something in that that's unutterably deep because this is, this is right at the limit of my ability to understand things too. So it's speculative beyond belief, but it seems to me that we are thrown challenges and that they're, that that in some sense those are best construed as tests of our ethical ability. So what human thought, his idea, it was something like this that at the beginning of time people were unconscious and that consciousness emerge with all of its catastrophes, consciousness of death for example.

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       And one way out of the burden of consciousness was to return to unconsciousness. You can do that with alcohol. You can do that by being dependent. You can do that by failing to grow up. You refuse the burden of consciousness by becoming unconscious again. But there's another way for which is to become even more conscious. So the idea would be a little bit of consciousness is like an illness, but if you can expand that consciousness upwards enough, then it's stumps something. It starts to become something that it's all that is its own cure and that partly what your goal is while you suffer through life is to heighten your consciousness to the point where everything gets integrated enough so that that's proper medication for the disease of self consciousness. And you don't believe that that was really the, that was one of the ideas that ran through the entire while the entire structure of Judeo Christianity, although not it wouldn't be limited to Judaeo Christianity.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       So it's, it's more consciousness rather than less, it's more attention and I, I think, I think there's something to that and some of that. See. The other thing you see in psychotherapy, for example, is that when you're trying to lead people forward out of the darkness, let's say out of anxiety and depression and despair and resentment, bitterness and anger and all of those things, catastrophic interactions with their family, is that you get them to stop avoiding confronting the terrible things that are in front of them, right? So basically what you do, instead of saying to them, you know, all those terrible things that are happening, just ignore those and, and, and find some peace, right? Get your mind away from it. That isn't what you say you say, turn around and look at them even more than you've been looking at them. It was a very paradoxical advice, but of all the things that have been proven to aid people's recovery and movement towards mental health, that's like at the top of the list, voluntary confrontation with what you are afraid of or, or what you despise even for that matter.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       And so young had an axiom that he derived from the alchemist, which was in stir curliness infinite tour, which meant roughly meant that which you most need will be found where you least want to look, which is fun. Yeah, well that's hit. I was also his explanation for why people weren't enlightened because you think, well, the California approach to enlightenment to speak, you know, kind of satirically is follow your bliss. It's like, well that's easy. If that was the case, everyone would be enlightened. But the union approaches, no, no, no. You do what's meaningful and pay attention, follow the truth and it will take you to the worst place you can imagine. And then maybe there's some chance for enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       Campbell somewhat revoked that, uh, I follow your bliss, uh, mantra though by saying he wish he'd said follow your blisters. You know, like one of these, the pain. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know he said that. Yeah. It's cool, isn't it? Yeah. The kids pull out on the scoreboard. That's good. That's like a novel thing. Oh, now I've been framed because you've said that I said something that you didn't know. And it's unraveled my entire veltin shower. And now I've reached for a bit of German language to pull my way back in. Oh yeah. Heard and Melville, he'll help me out. Like so like a, I'm reading this moby Dick, it smashed my head up, you know, like, and like, um, when he says in the, there's a, towards the end of the book I have, when he's hanging out with pip and stuff, he's, and he's really losing it now, but maybe he's finding it too. It is a bit weak. He talks about will, who is it that move this arm? He says, who is it that think disease thoughts? If the mighty son has no control over its movements, what control is Ahab over his thoughts? You know, in talking about fate and destiny and these ideas, again, seemed to me very potent, powerful themes. My, the petitioner

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       with a great whale. Right? And that's, that's the dragon of the abyss. That's, that's Moby Dick. Cause it's, it's the hero against the dragon of the abyss. And he's obsessed with it. Right? Well, he shouldn't be obsessed with it. It's, it's, it's what to be obsessed with is the dragon of the abyss. That's the oldest story of mankind is that your proper obsession is the dragon of the abyss. That's where the gold is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       Yes. That's where the gold is. Even though that's where things are most terrified, bloody tragic ending, except that you take Ishmael is the protagonist, in which case you should mount survives. And I have, you know, done a ruin it for anyone dice. Um, but like I, so it's a tragedy. It's a tragic encounter with the dragon of chaos. He's a failed hero. Fundamental outcomes. He's a, and he's gay. Lost that limb and stuff and I'm sure, yeah, sort of a symbolic, just like Captain Hook and the crocodile, he had a half the ha. Yeah. I love, for me it's very exciting when I see these patterns of preventing Elysium. For me it is exciting because this tree, it's the implicit energy and implicit in his truth. And now that thing we were talking about a minute ago where we were, I got excited because I said fully your blisters, the field's going to say is like that. So some sort of maximize understand in Buddhism of like let it burn, let it burn and burn, like take away from me everything. Right? Right. Oh there's the idea is also

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       there in Christianity, so there's no cult interpretation. There's letters on Christ's cross Inri Jesus Christ. It means Jesus Christ, King of the Jews. And it was put there by the Romans. But there's no cult interpretation in Latin, which I can re re reproduced, but it means through fire, all things are renewed. And one of the, one of the deepest ideas of Christianity is that you should burn everything off. That's part of you that isn't part of that thing that can die and be reborn. Like there's all sorts of baggage that people say that there's baggage that you're carrying. Everyone knows that it's deadwood. It's like that to burn off.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       And that's a lot of, that's way more of you than you think. She was. Way More than you think. Whilst you still haven't said whether or not you believe in God, and I won't keep going on about it because I'm not one of them.

Speaker 3:          00:41:42       People see what the means to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       So let, I'm like, it seems to me that you revere truth at, it seems to me that you are interested in the truth in scripture and mythology. Now then what this leads me to is something we've touched upon briefly. It's about the role of power and the function of morality and ethics and, and, and, and indeed simpler ideas that will have terms if not ideas such as compassion and goodness. So when like, you know, it's interesting to me that you've written sort of an accessible sort of self help type book that, you know, clean your room, stand up straight, stick your shoulders back, stuff that, you know, like I would not query there. The only thing that I feel like I would like to ask you about because my, I don't know if I even have a constituency, but the people, I find that, you know, I find myself talking a lot to Muslim people, uh, young women's self harming, eating disorders, these kind of clinical psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       So I imagine you have more and more access to that kind of information and those kinds of experiences than I do. I have this strong feeling that I am supposed to make myself available for the vulnerable, for the powerless and for the voiceless. So that's a fine idea. This is the one, it's how do you do it? How do huge bloody question. Sometimes they don't want me interfering in their lives majority of the time. Right. There certainly is that while there's an, there's a maxim that's often applied by people who work in old age homes, which is never do anything for the residents that they can do themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       They can't still their own money and they're sleeping. Bobbie, I'm a Canadian comedian. Very funny that it was, I think something that has paid off over the long run. Yeah. Now, so isn't it? So it's hard. Like the thing about,

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       the thing about compassion is it's not sufficient to produce solutions. Compassion is an unbelievably useful emotion if you're dealing with six month old infants, they're always right. She's there and also now, but like a, you know what? I was taught very

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       well. You said it doesn't work. What

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       about what want to say is like, I know you said no, this thing about sort of good, but one of the, as a one off the essential themes, ideas about the Christ myth being, you know, sort of burn away all that cannot be reborn but bloody hell mate in the actual language, all he bangs on about is kindness, kindness, love, love, kindness, kindness, love, revelation. Not In revelation. He's a judge in revelation. What and are you still, you're still taking that is what's books beyond the gospels, you're still taking as the word of Christ. Well, I'm taking them as part of the entire Corpus of the story. I mean the reason that you thought revelation was appended to the Bible is because the Christ in the gospels was aired two s too much in sense on the side of mercy and not enough on the side of judgment.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       Because here's the technical, there's a technical reason. You know, it's like we've got one attachment. Oh Jesus. Well, you don't have a choice because if you have an ideal, it's a judge. Like you have an ideal and there might be an ideal that you have a view. It's simultaneously your judge because you fall short of it. I understand this cause that's funny enough, I was talking to the fellow that taught me meditation yesterday, Bob Roth. So he's a student of the Maharishi. You know that. He said that when Maharishi was asked what is the one principal, the one principal, he didn't say kindness or compassion or anything like that. He said, discernment, discernment, and which path are we going to follow? Their attention, guarding, but judgment. That's why in revelation Christ divides the damned from the saved and most of the damned bitch discernment. And what that means in some sense is that there's a thousand, there's 100,000 ways to do things wrong and only one way to do them right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       Or maybe only five ways of doing them right. But you know that in your own life is that the, the, the, there's an infinite number of snares that you can tangle yourself up in and to find that pathway where everything is balanced, that's very, that requires continual discernment at attention. And so you, you can't have an ideal without it being a judge and you can't, you can't live property without discernment. But that doesn't mean compassion and compassion isn't relevant. It doesn't mean that at all. A guy ask you something that sort of occurs to me. See, like, I like you, I found myself in different types of controversial situations, various conflict and many, much of the time is because, uh, like Albert maysles said, tyranny is the deliberate removal of nuance. People remember, I didn't even say that. That's a good phrase. It's good shit, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       But like the thing, right? Deliberate removal of a new audience. Yeah, that's, that's what makes it different than ignorance because ignorance, there's no nuance and ignorance, but it's excusable because you just don't know any better. But when it's deliberate, that's a whole different story. It's very nice. Who said the album mays was filmmaker who made like grey gardens. He made that be, I did a documentary with him very briefly and he uh, he made that Beatles movie when the Beatles first came to the states. He made gimme shelter as the maze was probably that I like old guys now. Brilliant Documentarian, uneasy. I'm crew here and nodding the approval. He invented much of the fly on the wall verite style that's informed subsequent documentary tyrannies that deliver it. Removal of nuance. I worked with him sort of briefly filming none other than President Donald Trump of all people.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       But like one of the things that I wanted to talk about was, um, if I like this is the thing, I don't like all of the, I don't like the, I agree and I or I feel, I don't know what you feel that, that you know, that one of the, the, the neo liberalism abandoned its allegiance to and leftist politics. It has in a sense abandoned the working class and I can understand their rage and, but the feeling I personally have is when, if I sense that I'd said things and I've done this so I know that have offended women, which I, you know, when I was more, when I was a single person that was promiscuous, I know that that course be comfort, aggression and conflict. Or when I've done things like, you know, in the spirit, a few mother of cat, like a kickback.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       I've always felt bad. If I feel like I've offended people, the I would, I would regard or culturally or regarded as vulnerable. Yup. So like around the, uh, like I, when we make the conversation about the use of language, tyranny and oppression in free speech, you know, obviously I agree with you, but the, but I do take from, you know, the Gospel version of Christ, the idea that kindness, love, we can't, we have to continue to find resources for ongoing, you know, I will continue to fail, but we must continue to be loving. So I'm, my question is, is if you are found herself in a position where I kind of think some people were using you to sort of say fuck you women or fucking you transgender people. And for me I think I would want to still go on. That's not my bag. So where do you stand on that?

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       Well, I think, I think that, first of all we'll go to the most fundamental part of the question, which is this issue about love. Then like one of the things I've thought about a fair bit is the meaning of the sermon on the mount. And as far as I can tell, it's, it's a, it's basically a two part. It's two part wisdom. The first is that you should aim at the highest good that you can imagine. And that would be a good, that includes everyone, right? So if I wanted what was good for you, say if I genuinely wanted it, I wanted in a way that was good for you now and good in the long run and good for you and your family and your community. And maybe good for me too. You know, we could conceive of that as the desire and I think that's a good definition of love is that you actually want the best, you want the best possible outcome.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       And in the Gospels of course that's extended even to your enemies. Yes, right? Is that okay if we're going to have things good, let's have a good enough for even the people that set themselves up against me. Because if the world was running property, things would be good for them too and that would be better. And it seems to me that that's a very good way of looking at things. It's a difficult way of looking at things. And then the second part of the sermon on the mount is something like having established that as your aim, which is no easy thing by the way, right? Because you have to be pretty clear headed and single minded to actually want that to be rain. Then you can concentrate on the day and you can try telling the truth and you can ally. So there's truth and love that are allied together.

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       Truth, love and attention. It's something like that that are all allied together. Um, with regards to transgressing against the vulnerable. I don't think that that is what I've done. I think that people have claimed that, but I don't think there's any evidence for it. I mean, first of all, I know absolutely that I have brought perhaps thousands of people, maybe tens of thousands of people, but certainly thousands of people away from identification with the right cause they write me all the time and tell me that I've received about 30,000 letters specifically from people who've been watching my youtube videos since August and 25,000 of them are. So we've tried to count are from people who said that they were in very dark places and that their lives are much better, much oriented towards truth and responsibility and a wave from political ideology, mostly on the right. Right. That they were attracted on the right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       Because I have more people like that. Right. Me Than people who say that I say rescued them from the hell holes of the radical left. Um, I think that's more of a historical accident and some in some in some whites than, than anything else. And but also with the transgender issue and more specifically, I've received now at least 40 letters from transgender people and the only one of them was critical and it wasn't that critical. The rest of them all said, um, we never signed up to be poster boy of the year for the radical left. And it's, no, it's been no picnic. Believe me. All that's happened is that our lives have become much more difficult. And I believe that and I don't see that. I think one of the mistakes that the, the radical left makes, and this is part and parcel of their flirtation with identity politics, is that they fall all over themselves to believe that if a person identifies as a minority, then they immediately have the right to speak for all the people who are in that minority. And that's a claim that I reject completely. I mean, first of all, there is no transgender community. It's not a community because the community is constantly interacting and networking and has a shared purpose. And old out transgender people are just as diverse as any other people. It's like saying, well there's, there's no real black community, there's not homogenous political viewpoints across the black population.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       I, I agree to appoint the, these taxonomies are necessarily externally imposed because how would they be intrinsically experienced? I understand that. But also it seems to me that there is a thing called the experience of being an African American and you can put into that high prison populations for young males, lack of educational opportunity or work opportunity that day is available for that. So while community may be an incorrect term, literally there is this, there was a straw that seem to be underserved. And another concern I would have about, so some of the war, the re-purposing, you know, as far as far as we know so far or have much of your arbitrary on online work seems to me that it supports the powerful is a ports hedge money. I would, I don't agree that things are as simple as white men. Our ability to pat and let you know that you know, like, but I'm only interested in who is able to effect change.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       Who is able to influence, who can you not attack in public? What is possibly like, who is being controlled? That's what interests me. So like in a transnational corporations, economic elites, you know, like sort of, and how are they serve by what I say or by what you say. Okay. So that, that's a reference back to the existence of inequality. We agreed or inequality back to that problem. Oh yeah, yeah. You're saying it's natural, which clearly it's not. You cannot leave it at the feet of capitalism. That's absolutely clear. That and the fact that it's naturally though capitalism, what's that? Capitalism doesn't help. There's so many, like in a Marxist critique, what I understand that it is that capitalism is built on limitless growth from finite, from finite resources. And also capitalism will always, always be redirected and criminally misused. And, and they're sort of the economics of our time.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       It sort of for me is demonstrable. I know stuff. There are people that say, oh no, people are richer now than ever, but like, you know, staying in La for a while and there's 90,000 homeless people in the Greater La area, it seems like some sort of like the apocalypse is creeping in. People are richer than they ever have been, but the extreme extremes of inequality are high too. And there's some evidence that there's some evidence. Well here, here's an example of how these things might work. So imagine that people, that people are getting richer, there's absolutely no doubt about that. But here's, here's what we got. More stuff. Even though like, I'm sure you would agree that carving, that's what starving, that's good. Obesity is a bigger problem in the world now than starvation. That's a big deal. That's a big plus. But here's the way it still implies that people are being underserved by the sea, by their operating systems.

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       Oh, but there's no doubt about that. And it's still in first inequality also. Well, first of all, there's no doubt that any social system has a tyrannical and arbitrary aspect. I mean, that's an architectural training, right? Any of course. And even now, even well functioning systems have a tyrannical aspect. Not mostly, or at least merely because they're more native Americans. Who your gown. We've not native Americans, native Canadians that the Kwakwaka'wakw then guys like how's their social system set up? Oh it's a catastrophe. Go on. Oh well I mean it's a catastrophe for all sorts of reasons. I mean some of it's true. Yeah, it is. It is. The situation is very catastrophic. But you mainly because well the reserve system was set up in Canada and it had a possibility of working when there was a possibility that small communities could work economically. But small communities don't work economically anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Like if you go through Saskatchewan for, for example, or central province in Canada in the 1960s there were thousands and thousands of small towns, mostly Caucasian. That is because of their dots. Capitalism. No, no it's not. It's, it's deeper than that. It's the same prop. Well here's, it might be deeper than it, but in its current form it is company. Cause I would agree that, what is capitalism a manifestation of greed? Well, you could say, well, it's the same thing that, but the same thing has happened all over the world. Like urbanization is taking places a tremendously rapid rate. It doesn't matter what the culture is or the form of government.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       So you think that the politics is happening at a lower level. The phenomenology, that's where the, where the significant is. Ha Ha is a bigger time. And within it, political systems are just learning about. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't. That's man. All the ones we have in search a fairer, more just better ones. If typically, if they are empirically not working, come up with a way to reliably flattened inequality, that would be a good thing. But the empirical evidence suggests so there's a bunch of things it suggests. First of all, if you look at the, at the attempts to alleviate inequality over the last 200 years, whether there were left wing governments in power or right when governments are made absolutely no difference whatsoever to the degree of inequality, the only things that have been reliably demonstrated to flatten out inequality are catastrophes, wars, revolutions, epidemics.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Um, there's one other war revolution epidemics. Well, it's going to be some kind of holsman now. Yeah, it starts right. It's another horsemen, and I can't remember which it is, but, but at a price of the price of radical redistribution seems to death. Yeah. There and no one has come up with these things because of how power functions. Because like in a row, in an unequal system, whilst there are many people that are suffering, there are some people that are benefiting. I'm in a tear that benefit from their current economic situation. Um, I drive a nice car. I have nice house. I go where I want. Well, let's look at that for a minute. Like, if you think about how that happened in your life, I bet I can tell you how it happened. Well, I mean, if this isn't a personal account, but Bennett Bay, you hadn't assessed in one dimension, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       High success, but because you were successful in that dimension, all sorts of opportunities came your way. Like my suspicions are that where you're sitting now, you have more opportunities than you can deal with it. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. Right, right. Exactly. Well, the, see, this is part of what seems to drive inequality is that as you get successful, the opportunities that come your way start to multiply and they don't multiply linearly. They multiply exponentially. And so when you start moving up, you start moving up faster and faster and faster and faster, and then you'll hit a point where you have so many opportunities that you don't even know what to do with it. And so it's a nonlinear improvement. But the, the, the downside of that is you might've had periods in your life that were like this too, where let's say you start to get depressed and then you start to drink because you're depressed and then you start to isolate yourself because you're drinking and you're depressed and because you're drunk and depressed, then your friends start to abandoned you and then you lose your job.

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       It's like you're not going downhill in a straight line. You're going downhill faster and faster and faster until you fall off a cliff. And that seems to be how the world works is like there's a center point, it's unstable, things improve, then they improve exponentially and things fall and then they fall off exponentially. And that seems to be what's driving inequality. You start to succeed and the probability that you'll continue to succeed starts to expand. And we don't know how to control that. And well here, here's some other examples of it though, because I said you couldn't lay it at the feet of capitalism. The same thing happens to cities. A small proportion of the cities get all the people. So some cities grow like mad and others fail catastrophically. Like, like Detroit, it, it, it applies to the massive stars. So there's a very few stars in the Milky Way that have most of the matter. Hmm. So it applies to the height of trees in the, in the jungle.

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       Right. And do you think if things are applicable in cosmology and in biology the way that they are, their application politically and sociologically becomes less relevant because you see these phenomena as being broader, then you don't know me don't keep an interaction

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       less relevant. I just see, I don't think the left wingers are pessimistic enough about the problem. They say inequality is a problem. It's, yeah, yeah, I did call is a problem. Like it's, it's a terrible problem. But then they say, well, it's probably a function of our political and economic systems and we could fix those. It's like, no, it's not a function of our political and economic systems, or if it is, it's at such a deep level that we don't know what drives it and we certainly don't know how to control it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       Does that, but does that not mean Jordan that would you then reject any attempt to auto systems in favor of fairness? Because it seems to me that the focus is on like, and as it would be for clinical psychologist, individual change. Now it's part of my personal experiences without individual change. Social change is sort of irrelevant and many great gurus, which you answered it right then and there

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       because, because I am concerned with inequality, say saying with social instability and I, and I've thought about it for a long time, I knew that the left wing approaches tended to fail catastrophic and the right wing of course isn't particularly concerned with inequality. So that

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       left wing fails and the right wing don't care. Yeah, that's right. That's, that's fun to see the danger sufficiently and the right wing also tends to think that the spoils go to who deserves the, yeah, that's kind of true, but it's not completely true. So that's part of that because we're not all because of course, and what I like from a leftist perspective would be that we're not starting with from a level playing field when the system isn't perfect at selected. And this is why I think a spiritual solution, but it's something that is beneath or beyond material is the only way that true progress is likely to be achieved. I was thinking if there's something that you said before about when we were talking briefly about kindness and compassion and it occurs to me and this race program I'm sure very simplistic, but the heroism itself, by which I mean sacrifice, the willingness to sacrifice yourself for a greater idea.

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       What excites me about the idea now, and I believe why the phenomena is so loaded, is if someone is willing to die for something, it's that they believe it's bigger than them and in fact that themself, their self is not the truest thing. That there is something greater if I will give my life for another person is almost an acknowledgement of oneness. The temporal illness of the individual eight itself. And we all worked so hard to achieve individuation and I'm sure much of your work as a clinical psychologist who's guiding people towards it. But for me it is just a, uh, temporary resting place because having had the kind of experiences of personal humiliation, annihilation, success, failure for decimation here, like you know, all of these things, but what, what I've been led to and what I continue to struggle with this, how do I, how do I serve? How am I of service? How do I help her though?

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       Do I think that that's, that is the solution to the problem? It's like, I don't think the solution to the problem of inequality is sociological. I think it's psychological. I mean, partly what I'm

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       dry because it's closer to essence because it's my essential, oh, because society has to be a reflection of individual psyches or collective psyches. Why is it psychological temptation?

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       The temptation towards resentment and destruction that's associated with sociological approaches to inequality is too great and that as a consequence, those, those movements, 10 inexhaustibly to become corrupt and destructive began. I think the orwell put his finger on it when he said the middleclass socialists don't like the poor. They just hate the rich and that hatred. I think that hatred gets the upper hand in sociological movements. I think that the best approach to ameliorating inequality is to strengthen the individual. I mean that and that's, and that's what I've concentrated on doing what we have this program, uh, the self authoring suite and there's a component of that that helps people write an autobiography and another component that helps them write an analysis of their personality and another component that helps them write out a plan for the future. And we've used that. We've studied the effect of having people write out a detailed plan for their future and it's a proper plan.

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       It's like, okay, look, you, you get to have what you want three to five years down the road. You get to have the friends that you want. You get to have the family you want, you get to have the career, you want the education, you get to take care of yourself properly. You get to withstand the temptations of drug and alcohol abuse and other sorts of impulsive pleasures. You get to make productive and meaningful use of your time. Okay. What does that look like for you? Write it out, what does it look like? Do you need a vision? And then you need another vision of how terrible things could be if you let all your bad habits get the upper hand. And we've had people do that in an experimental situation and most of them are college students. And the consequences of that, there were two consequences.

Speaker 2:          01:04:49       One was general, which was that university students who were about 30% more likely to stay in university and got grades, there were were we're about 25% better. This is a wall of pitting effect, but even more interestingly, and this is the coolest thing I think that we ever discovered us in our, in, in our psychological research, we did this research in Holland at the, um, uh, at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam at the Rotterdam School of Management. And we ran business students through the future authoring program for multiple years. So several thousands of them. And we stratified them by gender and ethnicity. Pretty a pretty rough cut. Men, women and then Dutch nationals and non Western ethnic minorities. Okay. And so that the performance was like this. The Dutch women were at the top. Then the Dutch men, then the, then the non Western ethnic minority women, then the non Western ethnic minority men and they were behind the Dutch women.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       Bye Bye, bye. They they should about an 80% decrement in performance. Really quite catastrophic. Two years after they did the future authoring program, they were ahead of the Dutch women. It just blew us away because it was an, it was a perfect indication of the fact that you can use a psychological intervention to ameliorate what looks like a sociological problem and so I think the right, see, I think the right solution, and this is what I've been saying over and over in my my lectures and in this book, 12 rules for life and this is why I think it's become so popular. I said, look, you are right. You are right. You said earlier in the last question, well, you can't ignore the group classification problem. You know there's a black experience, there's a Latino experience, there's a female experience. It's like, yeah, that's true, but you have to decide what level of analysis you're going to make primary. And I think the primary level of analysis is the individual and the psychological rather than the group and the sociological. And I think if you put the individual level first and then you alluded to that cause it was, it was like an intuition that you were bringing forward, which was your intuition has been that the right level of progress is made at the level of the individual. And I think that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       I thought that's the end of the level where I have personal authority and also personal responsibility because the, here's the thing,

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       like here's the rule, how about this? Don't recommend any changes that you wouldn't suffer for if they failed. How's that? And that's the problem with large scale political action. It's like, well, here's how we should change things. It's like, well they changed them as well. It fails. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't hurt me. I'm not involved in it. It's like you should be careful when you try to change things.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       Sure. You suffered for your own stupid of course. Of course. You wouldn't bet that that also plays into the hands of conservatism because you know when you said like that left wing change tends to be sort of potentially destructive. These of course these are not just left wing, right wing radicals to and even not yeah, there. And also there is sort of conventional politics and the ecological impacts that it has the inequality which are like, whilst your setting, you continued to say that the, the problem of inequality is an anthropological, uh, biological cosmological physical problems to really deep problem. It is a deep problem. And for me, whenever you get near a problem that has that level of profundity or ubiquity, the solution can only be spiritual. We have to access the transcendent in some way to look for solutions. And although that sounds a little airy fairy, why do you believe that?

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       I mean, I'm not disputing that, but you obviously believe, I do believe this. What, what drove you to that conclusion? I've been driven to this conclusion by the experiences of personal failure and personal limitation by the failure of individuation. By the failure of of my own grandiosity, the failure of my own ego, the failure of fame and power and money and sex and drugs that their inability of them to reach me in the belly of the beast. Deep, deep, deep down. Whether Leviathan is this, these cures, this alchemy was redundant. And what I have realized, I think there's the spiritual journey for me, the hero's journey in like, you know, I'm using reference points in which you are an expert and a professor is that that the death of the small s self and the realization of the capital s self means become a servant, become a servant of good, use your abilities to generate the maximum amount of love, the maximum about of mount of kindness and compassion and to be alert to where I can be of most use. Now for me, that can be incredibly limited because I'm still a deeply egotistical, narcissistic, flawed, failing individual. But what my focus is, what my intention is, what I'm trying to learn to become in this journey of self realization is a compassionate and loving man.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       So you added something to the tune though. Well you add useful to that. Useful, not useful as a finish. That's it. So the best definition of Christian compassion that I ever read was useful and generous. Right? Useful and generous. Right. And so I would say the Conservatives in air, the conservatives promote the useful end of the distribution and the liberals pr promote the generous set. But I know things need to be brought to you.

Speaker 1:          01:10:10       I would say. And given that the, you yourself have said the problem for example of hierarchies exist on a far broader spectrum than the political that these than the narrow, like when you were saying like on the whole left wing Democrat or Republican government or left wing, right wing governments have produced a similar amount of amount of inequality. I mean that's sad. It's, I'm not happy about this. I know. Sad thing. Doesn't it suggest also Jordan that the range of solution that were being offered is too limited? Yes, it, I, I don't think it suggests that. I think it indicates that, yes. And this is why I think that the problem of inequality has to be taken with more seriousness than it's being taken. And the role of the individual [inaudible] obviously you would focus on this as a clinical psychologist is paramount because like, cause I kind of believe when I think about sort of a sort of a fluctuating vivid grotesque right wing phenomena such as Donald Trump, I don't blame people for voting for Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       I understand why people feel furious. I understand the emotion of anger and rage and I suspect that all or all that plays out in the Zoetrope of the material realm is a reflection of the activity in the psyche activity in emotion. How could it be otherwise except for your course you say it cause in lobsters and nature so that suggest it's even more profound or the that the psyche is deeper than just human, right? The psyche is all the universal conscious and unconscious mind. So I suppose what I suppose what I'm thinking is how, what my interest is is how can I, let me ask you a question. What do you think that you've done in the last year? That's good. They are mostly small things. Acts of kindness. I have a daughter. You have a good relationship with her so that seems to be a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       That's been beautiful. That's been sort of in fact that is hugely significant. My new found ability to live at one might refer to as an ordinary domestic life. My willingness to let go of other people's perception of maybe things have all been hugely significant and my sort of, I would say my dedication to sort of self improvement in areas that could still be regarded as selfish is one thing. Still an improvement to sort of take exercise to look after myself. I'm like drug and alcohol free for like 15 years and at this point that the epiphany's are beginning to sort of coalesce. The things that that I feel I'm perhaps most important is to let go of self centeredness. When I, when I conduct myself in a, when I'm not continually thinking what can I get when I don't look at the outside world as a resource when I don't think, what can that person give me?

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       What can they give me when I think he's dead? I have a chapter on that and 12 it's called, it says do what is meaningful, not what is expedient and to do, to view the world as a place of resources that can be delivered to you. It's in some sense to be expedient is to take the short term, it's to take the approach of short term gratification, something like that. Yes. Self centered is materialistic too. It is materialistic but it's also, it's also, it's not optimal and it's, it's not wise and the reason for that is is that it actually turns out like if we're going to have, if we had a continuing relationship, I would want to try to do a little bit more for you than you do for me. I could do that even purely selfishly say because if I did a little bit more for you than you did for me, you would want to keep interacting with me.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       How does that, all right, so cause me and you I think get on relatively easy. We've found a frequency to communicate on, but say someone like the woman both high in openness, high in openness is a good service. Now, what about the woman on Channel Four news who seemed more agitated and stuff like do like me? So we were actually having a conversation, we're trying to have a conversation that's oriented towards discovering something and you think she has a sort of a series of linear bar model fruits affects and she was just dropping them regardless of what came back. Definitely. That's exactly what happened except once there was once when you, and you'll be mean to me and she was a bit like founded. Yeah. Yeah. Well when I complimented her on her ability to really be an issue on the spot when she said that she was the wrong thing to do. Yes, yes. Now the, uh, you are an academic, uh, clinical psychologist, but in this moment, do you not feel like it's a question that could be, you could easily post to me to feel like, I just want this, like that's the person that's been in front of you. That's the world in that moment. I don't think you have a particular hospital to that person. I'm messy, but like, uh, do you not feel like in, in that moment it w it would be of value and of service to nurture that person? Yes, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:14:34       Well, I had a conversation with a friend of mine, very smart friend of mine, his name is Wayne Marecki. Um, he's quite, he's quite the character wing, but he w he watched and I've had people watch what I've been doing for the last 18 months. Lots of people. And they report on what they think about what I'm doing. And so I asked Wayne about the interview and um, you know, he was happy about the fact that I conducted myself with a certain amount of Carmen detachment and, but he did say something very interesting. There was this, there was the kind of, the culmination of that interview was where Kathy was challenging me about my right to say things that might offend someone. And I said, well, I said, essentially, look, you've based your whole career and this interview on that. Right. You know, and congratulations to you.

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       That's what you should be doing. And then she was taken aback by that and I said, Gotcha. And she, she knows she was sort of flustered and she said, well yeah you did. And Wayne said, you know, you could have instead of saying Gotcha at that point you could have taken the opportunity there to, to expand on that opening and to try to have Jason Conversation very north lane for not doing that yet Christian thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I thought, and I thought about that a lot. I thought, well that, I think there were limitations in the format. Like by that time we were about 25 minutes into the interview, you know, so it was coming, it was coming close to an end. And you know, sometimes being funny cause I think it was reasonably funny. It was reasonably witty sometimes. That's okay too. Well that's why comedians are useful because they say funny things, but this Justin, yeah, well hopefully they do and hopefully they can get away with it. Right. And I think that that's often an extremely effective conversational maneuver

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       because he actually, as a matter of fact you said so who aren't coming to this. Another thing, I'm just frying a few things at you now because you know the reason I do this, cause I started doing a good degree at a university of course, so as called religion and global politics and one of the main things they taught taught me there, or one of the things I've intrigued me is the first thing they show you is this bit of a bull shark. There's bear literature by Boucher where some story can't remember it called the Chinese emperor system of taxonomy where a show and the stories of the house. I loved that game and I like, and it's sort of an part of the courses they took about who gets to determine what words like natural or power. I think, you know, who gets to determine how those terms are allocated, who gets to determine what's right deemed

Speaker 2:          01:17:00       religious, what's being rejected to build [inaudible] because I wasn't going to let the radical left just decided the linguistic playing ground and that's, they were trying to do you see their, their rationale was we're on the side of transgender people. I said, no you're not. You're trying to control the linguistic territory

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       in a sense like this is where this conversation is a cure. The parallels that conversation I had with Sam Harris cause we have Sam Harris. What I found myself saying is why are you so worried about this one particular issue of zealousness or extremism when it seems that power is actually situated elsewhere. It seems to me that, you know, I'm lost, you know, in that instance I suppose because that was the incidence that came your way. Uh, you, you as you told me at the radical left, you know, imposition of certain rules around language that you have. That was the reason for me plus the fact that be split. But you have also continued to Farro or plow that far over. Haven't you have considered tenue down or sort of a line that seems like Telia logically sensible with what happened there? Like is it continues to be, he's like in a, I know what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       Like I agreed with your analysis of the word proverb provocateur. If you don't, you know there's a person is provoked if they're not provoked, you're not a provocateur. So we say difficult labeled to apply to anybody. But it seems to me that you know when some, when people say, you know, young males are particularly sort of it attracted to your work, I do see that this is a time where males need guidance and like where there isn't the kind of elders, our elders, customs, initiations, routes to masculinity are in short supply. I can see that there's a real value in that, but I also feel that in this time of social contention, I then EU politics being part of it up and conflict that will ideas that promote unity and the emulation. If those kinds of boundaries I feel to me it would be particularly and especially valuable. Do you know, again,

Speaker 2:          01:19:00       the right way to do that is to concentrate on the individual. And so, so let me answer that two ways. The first thing, the first issue is that it isn't self evident that the reason that my, what I've been talking about has been attractive to young men. That might be uh, uh, like a fluke and it might be a fluke because almost everybody who watches youtube is male. Yeah. So like if I look at my youtube audience, it's 80% male, but that's true of youtube audiences in general.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       So it's just a typical youtube audience. Right. And so what's his that you intuition well, cause I complicated

Speaker 2:          01:19:38       did not. But I do know that since my book has come out, I've been watching the, the demographics of my, of my public audience that more and more and more women are coming out. So it's now to about 65, 35 from 80, 20, and more and more older people are coming out too. So I think a fair bit of it was a consequence of the fact that most of my exposure and was to the youtube audience, which happens to be mostly men. Now I do also think that there a particular crisis with regards to what might be described as proper pathways to masculinity. I also think that's at play. So I think there's two factors. But I also, I don't think Kathy Newman kind of went after me about this, you know, she said, well, you know, if you're directing your message towards young men, which I wasn't assuming that's the case, isn't that divisive?

Speaker 2:          01:20:28       And I would say, well, I don't think it is divisive because first of all, the masculine in women also needs to be developed. It's very, very important. And the people who are the enemies of the masculine in men are also the enemies of the masculine and women. So if you overprotect your sons, let's say you don't want to, you don't want to, you want to, uh, you, you overprotect them in part and, and, and weaken them because you were afraid of their masculine energy. You're going to do exactly the same thing to your daughters. So that, that, that,

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       so that, that the evil is that female, a female child would similarly be disempowered? Oh, definitely. Because you know, the thing is, this is another thing.

Speaker 2:          01:21:05       I am a psychometrician that's technically my, my job and we study may our measurement. Well and like it's a truism of psychometrics that men and women are more the same than they are different. You know, it's funny because I've been sort of positioned as someone who is constantly on about the differences between men and women, but men and women are more the same than they are different. And what that means is that the development of masculinity and women, perhaps it's not as important as the development of masculinity in men, but it's damn important. It's like it's a close second. And so if people are pushing down masculinity as a virtuous motive being, then it's, it has a detrimental effect on both. Next Buddy.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       I agree with this, uh, but I, but you would say did the determinately there and biologically that there is, I think that his masculinity and that thing, masculinity is present in both females and males. Definitely. Um, but I, I think again, one of the, one of the challenges that this argument or the appears to be built around is a sort of hierarchy around those traits. Masculinity being synonymous. For example, with power. Oh, here's the thing. I wanted to bloody ask him, check this out. Cause he was a bit, I said it on a youtube video on my own the other day and a four seat wonder if they stand up to scrutiny. That's, give it a bit, check this, I sit like in Sweden, they're banning sexually provocative advertising and now it's a kind of thing you hear a lot about like the objectification of women.

Speaker 1:          01:22:31       And I said to go, of course I support that because there's a male being subjected to lots of sexualized images of women has to a degree affected, uh, you know, particularly when I was younger, my, the logical conclusion to that is pornography, right? Yes. That doesn't really seem to be a good thing. It doesn't seem to be a good thing. Yeah. I don't look at pornography any more light, but pornography I think is, yeah, very corrupting, corrosive influence for me personally. It's not something I going to be involved in. I sit this check base. Yup. I goes, um, I feel the use of the female in advertising a in general is the ease of the perverted desire to worship the feminine then negate it and neglected. Feminine has found it's expression through consumerism and commerce because it is not being properly honored socially. What's your heart?

Speaker 1:          01:23:26       I made it up. I would have to think that. I'd have to think about that a little time. I would have to think about that a long time because ideally it's, it's an idea worth we're thinking about for awhile, like if there are essential, if we have a central yearnings, if we have like in like eeg, if we, if the in, if in indigenous cultures we would have diabetes to represent gender or certain energies that are subtler than gender. If there is a sense that socially those energies are not being expressed on it as you've implied with a male pathways, that's definitely the case. So one of the things that I've often thought about etiologies is that they're, they're like parasites on religious structures. And if you're thinking that the, the movement of feminine imagery up into the consumerist world is an analog or is at least in partial partial part, a consequence of not having a symbolic place where that attraction can be expressed.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       I think that's probably right. It's like, it's like in the United States is the, the first family tends to be turned into king and Queen. Yeah. Because there's no place for that symbolic projection. Yeah. The template requires it. I heard once an analysis of the Soviet Union, uh, after the revolution that it mimicked the monarchy tyranny that proceeded it just in a different format and as seeing, yeah. That so certain energies, Holy Trinity even, right? Yes. Mao, Marx, Lenin and Stalin depending on the trinity. And some would argue that we know sort of like the Christianity couldn't take hold in Latin America until they embraced the Pantheism of the saints and found and the figure of a virgin until they like, they know that in certain cultures the the virgin had to be elevated because there isn't a place in the father, son, Holy Ghost, for the divine feminine. You know, that's a union idea.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, definitely that, that's, that's an original idea of yoga. This is that cool that the trinity is missing a core tile and sometimes that's core tile is filled by the finger of the devil, and sometimes it's filled by the finger of the woman. So it's like, it's like the houses in Harry Potter, right. There's three good houses and slitherin is, yeah, there's in the bottom quadrant, it's a, it's a reflection of the same kind of Mandela structure. That's pretty cool. It's very cool. Very cool. Have a place at the table for the serpent. You have to have a place that was in sleeping beauty, right. In the Disney movie. They don't let in that they don't crone. That's right. They don't invite her to the Christening. And so their daughter ends up unconscious, right? They don't let the terrible mother come to the party. So how odder ends up unconsciously now. Domestic normal, everyday quotidian lives. What is the parable mother? How does that help section overprotection

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       down? I've ever protect the baby. Late fall over a little bit. That's right. You do do the least amount possible for your children. It's something like that. That's not neglect. It's nothing like that. It's like the old age home adage, you know, look, I've seen this lots of times with parents. It's like maybe you have to get your kid dressed up to go out. Well, it takes a long time. If you let your kid do it, you know, it's a lot faster just to do it. It's a lot faster not to have them set the table. It's a lot faster to do things for them. Plus there's, there's also, and this is part of the devouring mother archetype, is like if you've devoted your life to a child, perhaps more than you should have, let's say, then it's very difficult to let the child go. What?

Speaker 2:          01:26:44       What's there left for you. And so there's this terrible temptation to play. We'll all do everything for you, but you never leave me. And then for the child to say, yeah, that's right. That's exactly the right face to make for that. That's a very terrible thing. And you see that again in Disney sleeping beauty where maleficent has the heroic prints in the dungeon and it's laughing at him, right? She's not gonna let them go until he is ancient. And that's, and that's a consequence. Can we see the devouring level? We'll have some good pop cultural examples of the Disney movies all the time. Um, in, in the little, the Little Mermaid, Ursula devouring mother, the devouring mother shows up all the time. She's the witch. She's the swamp dweller. She's the, she's the evil queen in Snow White was the counterpoint. The fairy godmother. Fairy God mother. Just one.

Speaker 2:          01:27:30       Yeah. That's the positive feminine. And that, that happened, that that archetype manifests itself all over the place as well. The, the, the fairy godmother's a good one. Yeah. And you'll see in, in, in, uh, in sleeping beauty, there's three of them. Three little fairies that take care of the princess and the forest. They're there. The archetype of the positive feminine, so, so you always see, one of the things that distinguishes a religious viewpoint from an ideological viewpoint is that there's always a representation of nature or the unknown. Always you need one. And if that's highly guys think Christianity is the online, well in Christianity, I'd have to think about that for a minute. It partly, it's the virgin mother. It's mostly a positive representation in Christianity, so and that that would be the representation of the benevolence of nature. It's something like that. So that's the unknown.

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       But in a religious representation you have the positive and the positive and the negative aspect of the feminine. That's also the unknown. You have the positive and negative aspect of the, of the, of the state. That's the wise king and the d and the devouring king, and you have the positive and negative representation of the individual and the reason it's religious in some sense. It's hard to explain why in a very short period of time, but a religious viewpoint always gives you a balanced viewpoint. That's what makes it religious. It's like there's a positive element. It's intensely positive, but there's the negative counterpart and there's a positive. So let me give you an example here. Um, I can give you an example of how this plays out. Architecturally. The frontier myth that settled the west was essentially heroic, individual positive, bringing, uh, the benefits of ordering culture positive to the desolate barren wastelands of the west. Okay. So it's positive individual, positive culture, negative nature. Okay. So that's an ideology, but it's a powerful story cause it's true heroic individual bearer of culture, barren, desolate wasteland. It's true. But one of the things that eventually generated was a counter narrative. And that because it was only half the story, that counter narrative was the environmental narrative, which was rapacious individual bringing pillaging society into benevolent nature.

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       And they had to recast the indigenous people that lived on those land masses is savage, is not entitled to the same rights roic individually.

Speaker 2:          01:29:57       There were actually two competing tendencies in, in the western mind. One was the noble savage. So that was the first son. Exactly. And the other was denison barbaric. Dan is enough. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:30:07       the uninhabited waistline. So those are both arms. The romantic idea of the noble savage became some sort of whimsical new age thing, and they have a one and the other one that Dennis in barbarian became justification. Vagina side. All right. Listen, we look to wrap up because I can feel the technological anx, you know, a variety of ways, but a Dr. Jordan Peterson or professor Jordan Peterson, I don't know why, what, how to big you up enough with the, with your prologue. Thank you. Oh, title. Thank you very much. I've really found it fascinating conversation. You have you enjoyed that conversation? Yeah, it's good. I appreciate,

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       appreciated the invitation.
