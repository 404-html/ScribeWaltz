Speaker 1:          00:00          Curiously, I've been listening to a lot of George Orwell audiobooks, and it's amazing because there's these huge passages where he thinks, oh my God, what incredible foresight, how amazing. And then there's I'm a bitchy thing. Oh no, that's not how it turned out. Oh, like Hitler has not yet kicked off in that the road to Wigan pier is going, I don't like to look at, they sit at the bloke, I think he's going to be trouble. Yeah, I've got quick George do something. But then there's like a speculation about like how other things are going to pan out and it sort of a, you know, like this is the necessity for socialism. He does point out that like that socialism's requirement for mechanization and a mechanized utopia. We'll foul and I can't help but return to something that Gandy said prior to the Indian revolution throughout the British.

Speaker 1:          00:41          There's no point in overthrowing the British in order to simply replace them and their systems. And Gandy failed and disrespect. I mean, Gandhi had a vision of turning India into this collection of Agrarian Turkic Utopias. And the only thing left of Gandhi's vision in the core and Indian economy is his image on these rupee notes. That's the only thing left. And this is partly because, you know, Gandhi's analysis, uh, was inappropriate for the 20th century. You couldn't, I mean, it's a very nice vision to have India as a collection of agrarian utopias. It's just irrelevant to how the economy functions in the late 20th century. When you say functions, you know, functions in order to suit the needs of the powerful, it would have functioned pretty bloody good for most agrarian Indian villages. It just wouldn't have functioned well for the capitalist relationships that needed to be maintained.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Whether or not it was the British in charge or the Indians that were in charge. Um, again, I, I don't know what exactly went wrong, but from the very beginning, uh, certainly Nairu and the, and the leadership did not try to implement Gandhi's vision in a serious way, largely because they also realized, I mean, it's, it's not workable because most people want power. Ultimately. First of all, they want food. I mean, you could narrow that food, you know, narratives never discussing whether or not he was going to have food. He's getting food personally, the Indian people. But when you have, you know, we have a one point something billion Indians to feed, then, uh, you don't have a lot of room for errors or fraud maneuvers in the economic field. Now, the amazing thing is that today in India, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Even in India, it's not just in the west. So for me, that's just a perversion. Like that's just, well, that's mental. We need to enough full system. Yeah. And so if there's not enough so then we can abandon the idea that scarcity is the problem. Organization is the problem. There's too much food here. There's not enough food over there. Why is the food not gain over there? It doesn't suit the interest of the powerful to the food for the food to go over there. How do we affect the interest of the powerful we organize ourselves, we challenge the interest of the powerful. Who are the powerful is these companies here, these governmental organizations here? Key question to know who are the powerful world power is in? How does it function? It's very complicated. You mean the power is concealed? The true power without getting too conspiratorial?

Speaker 1:          03:16          Yeah. I mean certainly the modern world for a couple of centuries, one of the main functions of power is to conceal power. There is kind of a low of history. If you don't have a lot of power, you try to exaggerate your power. If you have a lot of power, you try to conceal it. If you're a king in England in the 12th century, you don't have a lot of power, but you tried to conceal your weakness by these extravagant displays of power. So you go with like a pile of gold on your head and you were all these furs and pearls and every now and then you tell people, okay, cut off his head and that makes people feel, oh, he's very powerful. But actually he's very weak. Uh, because the state is fairly weak. Then you move to the modern age and leaders in governments really have enormous amount of power but they won't, don't want to attract too much attention to it.

Speaker 1:          04:11          So you know that they dressed plainly like an ordinary person and uh, they, they live in a much lower light. They don't go about telling people, okay, cut off his head because they don't want to draw attention to all that power. So in point, it's very difficult to know where power really lies in the 21st century. Pageantry conceals ordinariness our flags out precessions all these, all this pageantry, all this ritual, all this ceremony helps us to believe there is a United States of America. There is an, England is not just a sort of an economic idea and a bit of land and some powerful people exploiting the vulnerable. It's a thing. It's a flag. There's an eagle, there's a symbol, there's a history. It's real, but bit by bit who am picking you on stitch and you discover there's nothing there except some powerful people exploiting some people without power.

Speaker 1:          05:04          That is your America, that is your England, that is you're Israel, you're Saudi Arabia. All just myths and stories so that the powerful can continue to exploit the powerlessness, whether it's a crown on her head or some stars and stripes on a flag. So first thing that people have to be disabused of is their myths of nationalism. Or then whatever method it is that's preventing them from acting in their own interests. It's more complicated and complicated and that cause I'll get people moving. Take for example the, the, the, the Arab spring. So it all started off very optimistically, like wonderful. We have a democratic revolution of the people. The people now gain power and it was hijacked and the collage, the curves were turned in the wrong direction. And we now have a much worse situation than before. I mean Egyptians and Syrians and people in, in, in Yemen and in, and they look back and we said, this is not why we had the revolution.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Something really, really failed. Yes. Because I think they had no idea. The Islamic Brotherhood have an idea whether you liked the idea or you don't like the idea. This is our idea. This is how we see society. This is our vision. The people that are on twitter don't have a vision for the site. That's why I think it's, it's dangerous just to go out, say on twitter and tell people, okay, go to the streets, take out the Kalashnikovs, fight against power. So it, it, you know, you can, you can have a week off revolution, but then if you don't really understand the actual palace structure, then your revolution will be hijacked and directed in, in, in, in, in, uh, towards goals which are not necessarily the best goals in the world. For example, like Spain in the 30s, brief flicker of an Arco Cinder colorism ultimately becomes, fascism, becomes neo.

Speaker 1:          06:58          I know so many examples of neo is a century ago in Russia, you heard the Bolshevik revolution, and within a very short time you heard stallion and the gulags and, and, and so forth. And um, you know, by within two or three years, the Bolsheviks were firing on the workers and peasants that they were supposed to represent. You have the, the famous case of, of the crunch dot sailors in the garage dot workers, which in 1917, we're kind of the avant garde of the revolution. And by the end of the revolution, the Bolshevik government was massive caring. They're very same workers in crunch dot. Which in the beginning where the big heroes of the revolution, it depends on whether you have an optimistic perspective or not. There's some days where I feel human beings are capable of creating this utopia. I believe it. I believe that this technology can be harnessed to create, uh, more, uh, in a world of justice and liberty then, then I'll hear like about some terrible refugee crises in Burma and think, oh Jesus, let's just leave it as it is now.

Speaker 1:          07:58          And this is I, you know, I don't know cause I didn't want to travel then when the aggravation, but to return for a moment to the optimistic perspective, if you can identify the powerful and you can, and you have a vision of a society that could be differently organized. This for me is to ingredient. That's a big if, I mean, if you look today the world, what strikes me most is that nobody, as far as I can tell, nobody in either the left or the right has any serious, meaningful vision for where you monitor will be in 2015 most of what you get is nostalgic fantasies about the past. Yes. But you don't have a serious vision, which takes into account a I and biotechnology and climate change in all that and really looks clearly at what, where can we be in 2015

Speaker 2:          08:55          wow.
