<v Speaker 1>Welcome Chi.</v>

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me on.</v>

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.373
<v Speaker 1>Really greatly to come on as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that my motivation for doing these </v>

12
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.094
<v Speaker 1>podcasts because I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as university you've been doing it </v>

13
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:46.184
<v Speaker 1>degree religion in global politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I felt like the sort of a </v>

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>dilettante's glee at new information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like when I was sort of getting</v>

15
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:58.550
<v Speaker 1>given essays and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minute I could meet these people,</v>

17
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the tele.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is part of that is in a way it's</v>

18
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>like make a wish foundation just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

19
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>making one person's wishes come true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.203
<v Speaker 1>so we wanted to start around the area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire because a sort of national </v>

21
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:19.304
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ethnocentric national identity in </v>

22
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>particular becoming very prevalent both </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our country and America.</v>

23
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to talk to you about colonial </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia and would you explain what </v>

24
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:37.241
<v Speaker 1>that term means and what this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment around brexit and trump,</v>

25
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>if you've got any analysis on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to kick us off with?</v>

26
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean the term colonial nostalgia,</v>

27
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>it kind of refers to if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public discourse,</v>

28
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 2>particularly around brexit and the vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave campaign and the idea that Britain</v>

29
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 2>is great and Britain can go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time it was great.</v>

30
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Well the time that Britain was great was</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was an empire when it rolled </v>

31
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:04.261
<v Speaker 2>over 25 percent of the world when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonies stretched out to the empire.</v>

32
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 2>The Sun never sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is the basis of,</v>

33
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.943
<v Speaker 2>of Britain's wealth today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is kind of what people are </v>

34
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.294
<v Speaker 2>looking back at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we go back to that colonial </v>

35
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.113
<v Speaker 2>prestige of Britain Nebula?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we say greatness mean tyranny </v>

36
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 2>and oppression effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.734
<v Speaker 2>With this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're celebrating and </v>

38
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 2>because we teach empire so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really understand the horror.</v>

39
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.853
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British empire was killed more </v>

40
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>people than the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

41
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.053
<v Speaker 2>it was literally a form of fascism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid waste to whole whole areas of the </v>

42
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 2>world and hope peoples of the world</v>

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>quiet if like an institution or nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed more people than the Nazis.</v>

44
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.933
<v Speaker 1>And the main reason we think the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bad is because they killed so many </v>

45
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.554
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean the British empire was </v>

46
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>worse than the Nazis?</v>

47
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:57.394
<v Speaker 2>in some ways actually the British empire</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Nazi's aren't separate in any </v>

49
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.784
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 2>There's a book that I'm Bauman </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociologist called and road where he's </v>

51
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:05.884
<v Speaker 2>called Holocaust and identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually argues that how we think </v>

52
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>about the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These though somehow alien,</v>

53
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>it's so outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so horrible.</v>

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It could never possibly fit within our </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful enlightened society.</v>

55
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.573
<v Speaker 2>But actually in the book he makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that the west modality </v>

56
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>capitalism is the only society that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have produced the Holocaust.</v>

57
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is racial </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

58
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.473
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the idea that Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't really people and we can prove </v>

59
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>they're not people from measuring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>food science,</v>

60
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>what end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's race,</v>

61
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the same racism which produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery.</v>

62
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It says that I'm not fully a person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can treat me like cattle.</v>

63
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same racism,</v>

64
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>the same science that proved that Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in human.</v>

65
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And also if you think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of death,</v>

66
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.253
<v Speaker 2>that scientific process of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing new about that for the </v>

67
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Belgium,</v>

68
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the killed about 10 million people in </v>

69
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>the Congo slavery wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was millions and millions of people.</v>

70
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.953
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense the holocaust is like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>logic of capitalism just don't tell </v>

71
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.020
<v Speaker 2>people we consider white and so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes law.</v>

72
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 2>He's horrible.</v>

73
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

74
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>As far as two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

75
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.044
<v Speaker 1>of course it was people that were white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I suppose in terms of their </v>

76
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a innovative commerce,</v>

77
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.123
<v Speaker 1>civilized country where people live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized lives and the victims were </v>

78
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 1>civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>

79
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it reveals a lot about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumptions around race,</v>

80
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>if you wouldn't even in a modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

81
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean contemporary context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider that was the same.</v>

82
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:36.954
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute that it was all </v>

83
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>living in Africa and that it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad because I didn't have net cut and.</v>

84
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the problem,</v>

85
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:44.144
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So big you see the logic of the western </v>

86
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 2>imperialism in Europe for white people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you see it,</v>

87
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.414
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually if you look the Holocaust </v>

88
00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:52.454
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think of the Holocaust is being </v>

89
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:56.480
<v Speaker 2>one of many imperial terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

90
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's really not even in the top 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it is the way that we categorize</v>

92
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>this information of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.193
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as if there's a like a handicap </v>

94
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply it.</v>

95
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.420
<v Speaker 1>He's was white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the worst.</v>

96
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Then down at like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

97
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your obviously right,</v>

98
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Speaker 1>thanks for illuminating me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

99
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.773
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that idea progressing and how is </v>

100
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that perpetuate in the idea of racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and that term?</v>

101
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I know from school net crow politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that,</v>

102
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 1>how is that continuing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is the,</v>

103
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.083
<v Speaker 1>what's the front line of these arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are at their most evident in the </v>

104
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.620
<v Speaker 1>most evident form of slavery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust?</v>

105
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>What's the version of that we're living </v>
<v Speaker 1>with now?</v>

106
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after the Holocaust and then people </v>

107
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>see like racial science is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is terrible,</v>

108
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>and actually maybe we should move away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from racial science.</v>

109
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 2>And before the Holocaust he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

110
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't racial science and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>

111
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:49.074
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just what we all kind of </v>

112
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 2>agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see that happen,</v>

113
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Jews,</v>

114
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I see that the terror of it in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of abandoned race.</v>

115
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.200
<v Speaker 2>So will hear people will say race </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't exist.</v>

116
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

117
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>We should move away from the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

118
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to ethnicity.</v>

119
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the way that we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about ethnicity is basically exactly the</v>

120
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought about rates.</v>

121
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So there's different ethnic groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their racialized.</v>

122
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.693
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Caribbean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you lumping Caribbean with </v>

123
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>African on the black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have Asian,</v>

124
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>which is India and Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

125
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Then you have mixed and even if you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the sensors,</v>

126
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy of white to black is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually visually represented,</v>

127
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's white,</v>

128
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Irish and then he's Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's mixed.</v>

129
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.180
<v Speaker 2>He's black and you see they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we talk about ethnicity,</v>

130
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:34.014
<v Speaker 2>he still says that black people may not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be inferior because of biology anymore </v>

131
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>were inferior because of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of language,</v>

132
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 2>because of our traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we haven't got any history.</v>

133
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.103
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a different version of the </v>

134
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.944
<v Speaker 2>same thing I thought was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So power you say mew tights but doesn't </v>

135
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>often accede in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

136
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:54.591
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

137
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 2>we can't do it in that way anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a new way.</v>

138
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

139
00:06:57.681 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about what's,</v>

140
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

141
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism really fundamentally about,</v>

142
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 2>it's about creating a system that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have Europe,</v>

143
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.683
<v Speaker 2>what are the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have Africa black the button and </v>

144
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 2>there's various gradations in between.</v>

145
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And that is actually what global </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics look like today.</v>

146
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not a coincidence that the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the world are in Africa and</v>

147
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>the richest countries in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the European West white countries.</v>

148
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it was designed for 500 years</v>

149
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is exactly how it is today.</v>

150
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>What possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other argument could there be other than</v>

151
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>previous colonial exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some actual meritocracy?</v>

152
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Is that the actual argument?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flat white European,</v>

153
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 2>small advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different and Africa,</v>

154
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terror is maintained.</v>

155
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:39.254
<v Speaker 2>If you think about are you doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree in international relations and </v>

156
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:43.424
<v Speaker 2>international development?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been going around to a lot of </v>

157
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.700
<v Speaker 2>places recently saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually what do they teach?</v>

158
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.543
<v Speaker 2>And even international development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're teaching you how to </v>

159
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 2>underdeveloped parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a whole.</v>

160
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>A whole colonial education system isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just about Britain.</v>

161
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.593
<v Speaker 2>It's about the elite from Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caribbean and Asia coming into Europe </v>

162
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>and learning about economic policies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>political ideas which are actually there</v>

163
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>in place to continue the oppression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the of the country.</v>

164
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.380
<v Speaker 2>So you have this idea that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop the global south through aid and</v>

165
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 2>through technology and through et </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cetera,</v>

166
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.483
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've missed the point and it actually </v>

167
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 2>these places of the world of poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the West is rich.</v>

168
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 2>That was the same then as it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't changed in any way,</v>

169
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's integral,</v>

170
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>

171
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.013
<v Speaker 2>that that story is concealed because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is at odds with the assumption of </v>

172
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Justice and Mary that is required to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain a power balance.</v>

173
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

174
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I actually talk about whiteness as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>more like a psychosis than like anything</v>

175
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:42.411
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

176
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Speaker 2>The idea of whiteness and progress and </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>

177
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

178
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>The ideas in the enlightenment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe is kind of the civilizing mission</v>

179
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 2>that spreads that truth to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not rational.</v>

180
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no rational basis did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

181
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've read any critical</v>

182
00:08:58.681 --> 00:08:59.514
<v Speaker 2>whiteness studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like David Rottiger and I'm </v>

183
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>knolling native who talk about the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can kind of teach at whiteness.</v>

184
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 2>If only white people would understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem historically,</v>

185
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 2>then they'd change and become allies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd all be happy.</v>

186
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Families actually I argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is much,</v>

187
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.880
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more serious than that.</v>

188
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 2>The reason you have this myth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>

189
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.313
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is because that within the political </v>

190
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.484
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the west needs to exploit the wrist and </v>

191
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>so what we do is we have this psychosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>which says,</v>

192
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>actually no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NIce,</v>

193
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

194
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

195
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.933
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's to hide the fact that </v>

196
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 2>actually the we're really living on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back of children dying.</v>

197
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

198
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.294
<v Speaker 2>Children die because of the system which</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives us money and so because we can't </v>

199
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 2>deal with it mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>

200
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>we create these myths about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful the world is,</v>

201
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I say,</v>

202
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>psychosis that has to conceal its </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence in order to perpetuate.</v>

203
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:56.901
<v Speaker 1>And even as sort of a little while ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that t via online news blog either.</v>

204
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>We did an episode on like literal kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining for some resource for your mobile</v>

205
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:02.544
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it made a very clear connection </v>

206
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are in the weft,</v>

207
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people that don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got blood on our hands,</v>

208
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but in our handheld device is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here he is,</v>

209
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:14.170
<v Speaker 1>he's seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to go down.</v>

210
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a ballroom.</v>

211
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.973
<v Speaker 1>And you feel like it doesn't belong in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your understanding of the contemporary </v>

212
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.174
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of these things about whiteness </v>

213
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.154
<v Speaker 1>as power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I as a white person that feel </v>

214
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:25.884
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have certain attitudes towards the </v>

215
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:32.361
<v Speaker 1>state and my sense of alliance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance Would be countercultural.</v>

216
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.623
<v Speaker 1>How am I categorized by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the terms of this new emergent </v>

217
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 1>narrative around power and oppression?</v>

218
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.583
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because this whole </v>

219
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:46.930
<v Speaker 2>discussion about like white allies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it had this,</v>

220
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.803
<v Speaker 2>had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was oxford yesterday talking about </v>

221
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.514
<v Speaker 2>this and sometimes I feel a bit like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedian when you kind of go </v>

222
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:52.694
<v Speaker 2>around and he played the little display,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audiences and you get different </v>

223
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:56.150
<v Speaker 2>reactions and you tested your material.</v>

224
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It's good because I feel like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic.</v>

225
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Because when you said I've done this at </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxford is good already.</v>

226
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>At the same level as oxford university </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my questions,</v>

227
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 2>but it was good because they actually is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a question of whiteness came up,</v>

228
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can white people do where the white</v>

229
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we do to solve the problem,</v>

230
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 2>the federal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

231
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky question because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take my idea,</v>

232
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:15.984
<v Speaker 2>if you take what I'm arguing here that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiteness is a psychosis and psychosis </v>

233
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:20.334
<v Speaker 2>are irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and actually in the left you can see </v>

234
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 2>this as much as you can see on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

235
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.753
<v Speaker 2>so you have left wing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swp marxist who will make these global </v>

236
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:31.450
<v Speaker 2>arguments about x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

237
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 2>zed who will say they were on the side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the oppressed,</v>

238
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.420
<v Speaker 2>but actually when you look at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that they,</v>

239
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.263
<v Speaker 2>they just as deluded as the right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascist because whiteness as a concept </v>

240
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:42.610
<v Speaker 2>is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll give you an example I'm at,</v>

241
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.303
<v Speaker 2>so anybody anybody's black and knows and</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to black events and african </v>

242
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>caribbean community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the swp,</v>

243
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 2>a socialist workers party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more prevalent than the police.</v>

244
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean they every day they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

245
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 2>They're always there peddling marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marxism,</v>

246
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 2>marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I quite like mugs and by the way,</v>

247
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.040
<v Speaker 2>but one of these events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

248
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:01.874
<v Speaker 2>it was a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a strike of set african farm </v>

249
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.424
<v Speaker 2>workers and teachers were always having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a strike here in this kind of moxies </v>

250
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.353
<v Speaker 2>will rule the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all workers were all in the same </v>

251
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:13.730
<v Speaker 2>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

252
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that we had to support.</v>

253
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>We're going to support the workers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Africa.</v>

254
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We had to support the teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

255
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 2>but they think about this for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work is inside africa.</v>

256
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:24.154
<v Speaker 2>Farm workers are pool are so poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of trade policies that benefit </v>

257
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:28.803
<v Speaker 2>british farmers and european farmers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers effectively and that </v>

258
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:31.954
<v Speaker 2>impoverished in marginalizes them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their conditions or conditions that we </v>

259
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 2>could never even contemplated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

260
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:38.674
<v Speaker 2>Teachers are paid out of taxation from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that very system which was floyd said </v>

261
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 2>african farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so women were.</v>

262
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>When teachers are asking for paintings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and better pay,</v>

263
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.623
<v Speaker 2>what they're asking for is a better is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more fruits from the exploitation of </v>

264
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 2>places like South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in no way,</v>

265
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 2>shape or form are these two people </v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

266
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Actually they opposed to completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed because teachers,</v>

267
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 2>anybody on myself as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make our money off their exploitation</v>

268
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.613
<v Speaker 2>and that's the psychosis of whiteness </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't understand the </v>

269
00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 2>actually your part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

270
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 2>all of us here are part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily the solution,</v>

271
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.633
<v Speaker 1>but when you have a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction such as that one within </v>

272
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:18.541
<v Speaker 1>which your participation is voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than like I've literally,</v>

273
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:20.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of the system now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you avoid that aNd how can </v>

274
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.713
<v Speaker 1>alliances be formed on that basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thinking then if you think of a </v>

275
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.500
<v Speaker 1>power like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.140
<v Speaker 1>like I've what I thought was brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

277
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.840
<v Speaker 1>that oj documentary when to use it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

278
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.683
<v Speaker 1>they use that oj simpson documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about race in the United States </v>

279
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.560
<v Speaker 1>of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stories about crime,</v>

280
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>stories about commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism a racial tension.</v>

281
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>But I mean really in a way that I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

282
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a lot of important stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it was about a oj simpson's</v>

283
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>racial identity at a time when the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights movement,</v>

284
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>when people were making huge sacrifices </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mohammed ali,</v>

285
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence and gave up his belt and </v>

286
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

287
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>But like there was an interesting moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it said,</v>

288
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.730
<v Speaker 1>well why does the oj simpson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is an african american man,</v>

289
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>half the obligation to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've got white.</v>

290
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:16.864
<v Speaker 1>Like you wouldn't know why athlete or </v>
<v Speaker 1>white star would have that obligation </v>

291
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.424
<v Speaker 1>would be expected to carry that mantle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it began to sort of challenge what </v>

292
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 1>whiteness and blackness mean as sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization system.</v>

293
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:29.624
<v Speaker 1>So like if like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knoW what this distinction I exceed </v>

294
00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:33.794
<v Speaker 1>there is a historic colonial and indeed </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary continuation of these </v>

295
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>themes and categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

296
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this,</v>

297
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 1>a crossover isn't there because let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say barack obama as the,</v>

298
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when he was the president of United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

299
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>he was an african american man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is in the,</v>

300
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if you use that argument about the south</v>
<v Speaker 1>african farmers,</v>

301
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>the teachers who he is the puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>he's the president over folks on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

303
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>How does that all work?</v>

304
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

305
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.193
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of the thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychosis is I always say this isn't </v>

306
00:15:02.011 --> 00:15:03.900
<v Speaker 2>just for white people in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

307
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Let people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

308
00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:05.994
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many believable would also kind of </v>

309
00:15:06.991 --> 00:15:08.800
<v Speaker 2>embrace this kind of psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

310
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the most critical people </v>
<v Speaker 2>still am one of the most critical people</v>

311
00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:13.224
<v Speaker 2>of barack obama's presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a black president for after </v>

312
00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:18.930
<v Speaker 2>eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally every single indicator,</v>

313
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 2>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employment.</v>

314
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.190
<v Speaker 2>And if a black people went down and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at employment,</v>

315
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.390
<v Speaker 2>black wages went down so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually,</v>

316
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 2>employment was basically irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you think then what we achieved,</v>

317
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.990
<v Speaker 2>what was achieved by these and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>the celebration of obama,</v>

318
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.853
<v Speaker 2>particularly by african americans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people here in my mum cried when </v>

319
00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:40.320
<v Speaker 2>obama was elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of that psychosis,</v>

320
00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:41.154
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we think things are changing when </v>

321
00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:43.014
<v Speaker 2>actually if you look at the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests that none of these things are </v>

322
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:46.680
<v Speaker 2>actually changing and in many ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in,</v>

323
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.813
<v Speaker 2>they get worse.</v>

324
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So then what's the value of that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category?</v>

325
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>If it is ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

326
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.514
<v Speaker 1>literally meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what sense is he an african american </v>

327
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.683
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than like he's able to say how he </v>

328
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>felt in shops and that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

329
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things that you fill in bloody </v>

330
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of amazing and a fist bump.</v>

331
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.483
<v Speaker 1>Avoidance of literally superficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose is sometimes what I </v>

332
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:09.580
<v Speaker 1>think race ought be in utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the,</v>

333
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.463
<v Speaker 1>a superficial monica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what was the value and meaning of </v>

334
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.524
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that there really wasn't </v>

335
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>any?</v>

336
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

337
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll,</v>

338
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you'll find some academics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will be very critical of obama.</v>

339
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.883
<v Speaker 2>But say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

340
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.110
<v Speaker 2>it's limited what you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

341
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 2>We can just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big a deal,</v>

342
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

343
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd actually take the opposite approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stated that the symbolism of obama,</v>

344
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:32.894
<v Speaker 2>the point of obama's blackness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why he got elected </v>

345
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.433
<v Speaker 2>was part of to aid this idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychosis was to aid this idea of the </v>

346
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 2>american dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>

347
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Barrack obama's blacknEss is violent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

348
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what does it do?</v>

349
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:47.744
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that my mom's grinder and </v>

350
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:49.860
<v Speaker 2>mom was a radical in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

351
00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 2>in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these politics about revolution,</v>

352
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.103
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>

353
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 2>And she's crying on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

354
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.083
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the day this very near liberal </v>

355
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.983
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never offered one single thing to </v>

356
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:01.950
<v Speaker 2>blake.</v>

357
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Never said he was gonna do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>

358
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 2>but we just kind of assumed because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

359
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.680
<v Speaker 2>there's going to have something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

360
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And then you see afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's kind of praising the symbol.</v>

361
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:14.650
<v Speaker 2>You've got black family in the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and obama with young black men,</v>

362
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 2>but actually get belief that symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

363
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:18.254
<v Speaker 2>Trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's trying to tell you that things </v>

364
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.000
<v Speaker 2>have progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things have changed,</v>

365
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 2>that progress is being made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

366
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 2>look at every single indicator tells you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that from black people,</v>

367
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 2>particularly in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are getting worse,</v>

368
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:29.774
<v Speaker 2>probably not better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the symbol of obama and why his </v>

369
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 2>blackness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he used his blackness and why he got</v>

370
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:35.954
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons he got elected is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it keeps us more diluted and </v>

371
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 2>tied into a system which can never </v>
<v Speaker 2>providers freedom,</v>

372
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 2>justice or equality.</v>

373
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.160
<v Speaker 1>People will hate being told that story I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fancy</v>

374
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and probably not the most popular to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

375
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

376
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.500
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

377
00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:53.881
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

378
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 1>that type of critique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say no,</v>

379
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:56.304
<v Speaker 1>let's not get distracted by what appears</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive and what appears beautiful </v>

380
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and promising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how power is actually behaving.</v>

381
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.033
<v Speaker 1>So like to return to my prior point </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like how do I as a white person </v>

382
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.823
<v Speaker 1>from a working class background whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude is always been anti like me </v>

383
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:23.060
<v Speaker 1>reaching for my little slice of the pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

384
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

385
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>like how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

386
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.770
<v Speaker 1>participate what like how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you say that about the british</v>

387
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:31.491
<v Speaker 1>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

388
00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I sort of think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

389
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:33.384
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all built on like biscuit tins or </v>

390
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 1>union jack on it and land and open glory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and light over the butcher and people in</v>

391
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.660
<v Speaker 1>India and africa and doing whatever was </v>
<v Speaker 1>required and,</v>

392
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.470
<v Speaker 1>and nation was always a front for </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations anyway.</v>

393
00:18:45.471 --> 00:18:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing's been a black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

394
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like how do we have alliances that </v>

395
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 1>aren't caught up in sort of bureau </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracies such as that teacher,</v>

396
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>south african farmer alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we go,</v>

397
00:18:57.631 --> 00:18:58.464
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's let the radical white folk in </v>

398
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be of some use.</v>

399
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Or is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can it not work?</v>

400
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the bar,</v>

401
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.913
<v Speaker 2>the material we some testing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't maybe the best [inaudible] I'm </v>

402
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 2>a big malcolm mixed fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love medical mix and</v>

403
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.680
<v Speaker 1>may I know if that's all right with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

404
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.603
<v Speaker 1>More the merrIer.</v>

405
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:14.643
<v Speaker 2>Deb backup as a story in geography where</v>
<v Speaker 2>malcolm white lady comes to ask them a </v>

406
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.040
<v Speaker 2>similar question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can white people do?</v>

407
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.660
<v Speaker 2>and he basically turns around and says </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing and in walks up and he feels bad</v>

408
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have malcolm x anyway,</v>

409
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.263
<v Speaker 2>probably a bit nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an intense guy and she was crying </v>

410
00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 2>and she was really upset and he felt bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

411
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.961
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

412
00:19:34.961 --> 00:19:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't said this actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

413
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.330
<v Speaker 2>People have the responsibility to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into white communities and making these,</v>

414
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.840
<v Speaker 2>these arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

415
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I've already advanced much more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

416
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.673
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that malcolm used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do was just to go round and tell white </v>

417
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally they were devil.</v>

418
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd say you do evil,</v>

419
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.290
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what you've done.</v>

420
00:19:50.291 --> 00:19:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Look at this critique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

421
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.280
<v Speaker 2>and I guess as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a black scholar,</v>

422
00:19:54.281 --> 00:19:55.810
<v Speaker 2>an activist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most I can do.</v>

423
00:19:55.811 --> 00:19:56.644
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can have the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you can do other than to prove the </v>

424
00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:02.050
<v Speaker 2>critique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Runk I would love to be wrong.</v>

425
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.730
<v Speaker 2>But actually if I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>

426
00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:04.564
<v Speaker 2>presently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently at the left as well as the </v>

427
00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:06.844
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you break out of that </v>

428
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:10.690
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I call it a psychosis because</v>

429
00:20:10.691 --> 00:20:11.524
<v Speaker 2>it's completely irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing you can do to </v>

430
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:14.170
<v Speaker 2>penetrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually to my,</v>

431
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 2>of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

432
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>my work is more about what we do as </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people.</v>

433
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.980
<v Speaker 2>We had a with,</v>

434
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.813
<v Speaker 1>of course that must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it like how I would have a person </v>

435
00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:23.440
<v Speaker 1>or allegiance around like addiction or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever because that's where,</v>

436
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that's just what I've been drawn to from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my particular wound,</v>

437
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.083
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I feel I know score on </v>

438
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.560
<v Speaker 1>that so I can be relevant and I can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful in that area.</v>

439
00:20:32.561 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I can't go around camp campaigning on </v>
<v Speaker 1>behalf of the group that aren't,</v>

440
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.040
<v Speaker 1>don't share the experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

441
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but what I feel like pure conjecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

442
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.990
<v Speaker 1>given the nature of what I've just said </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be the solution or my question is,</v>

443
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 1>is it not that we weather these </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize these categorizations are,</v>

444
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way wherever we find ourself </v>

445
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:59.521
<v Speaker 1>within that sort of peculiar college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the light that we be the nine,</v>

446
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:03.600
<v Speaker 1>the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a suit,</v>

447
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>a transcending the categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the nine.</v>

448
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.040
<v Speaker 1>What the narrative is like.</v>

449
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wars and his has happened and I'm </v>

450
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 1>aware of it now in the industries I work</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

451
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I work when I'm at meetings around </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

452
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

453
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:14.914
<v Speaker 1>we're all white still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of aware of that into an but </v>

454
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.240
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

455
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.073
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of super relevant and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm interested in is that as </v>

456
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 1>long as our identity continues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewrite those categories,</v>

457
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.624
<v Speaker 1>even if it's through overflow in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we continue in somehow to augment them </v>

458
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.121
<v Speaker 1>by like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:21:36.121 --> 00:21:37.390
<v Speaker 1>like that by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

460
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:38.224
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our story and this is what it </v>

461
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:40.534
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely accept the importance of </v>

462
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we ever go,</v>

463
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:43.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't win anymore.</v>

464
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 1>We don't want power to work in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we Challenge it in dismantling if</v>

465
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 1>we are a wednesday two welded to somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our categories?</v>

466
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is was,</v>

467
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it really does.</v>

468
00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It's really about taking onboard this </v>
<v Speaker 2>critique in a very serious way.</v>

469
00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.460
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think the left the left is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>general thing,</v>

470
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.303
<v Speaker 2>but people on the left markets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other academics have done this in the </v>

471
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:06.170
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

472
00:22:06.171 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the mobilizations like </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy,</v>

473
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.180
<v Speaker 2>occupy wall street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the 99 percent.</v>

474
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>

475
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.110
<v Speaker 2>that's an offensive way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>global global inequality.</v>

476
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.880
<v Speaker 2>If you are in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

477
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.743
<v Speaker 2>if you own the average wage in britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing someone like the top four </v>

478
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:20.444
<v Speaker 2>percent of earners in the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just recognizing that the conditions </v>

479
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.793
<v Speaker 2>that we are not just white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people who live with have hear a </v>

480
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.550
<v Speaker 2>pause in a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation to the conditions of people in</v>

481
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Speaker 2>the third world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

482
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.243
<v Speaker 2>there was recently a child bereavement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough inner family circle of friends </v>

483
00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:38.024
<v Speaker 2>because a car accident and two years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later everybody's still shocked by it </v>

484
00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:44.720
<v Speaker 2>and shook by it because it's so foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually in many parts of the world,</v>

485
00:22:44.721 --> 00:22:49.310
<v Speaker 2>children just die all the time when a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child dies every 10 seconds because they</v>

486
00:22:49.311 --> 00:22:50.420
<v Speaker 2>haven't got access to food.</v>

487
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.880
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is we're protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

488
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.923
<v Speaker 2>the horrors of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for us to pretend that we're all in </v>

489
00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:58.880
<v Speaker 2>this one big happy family of workers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that needs to go,</v>

490
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you say one thing to take that ethic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the equation,</v>

491
00:23:01.821 --> 00:23:05.720
<v Speaker 2>completely understand that all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>here at a meeting included are complicit</v>

492
00:23:05.721 --> 00:23:07.370
<v Speaker 2>in the system and benefit from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

493
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you see that in much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the of the left.</v>

494
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:10.694
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately that will be a starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and maybe you can build a proper </v>

495
00:23:13.221 --> 00:23:14.054
<v Speaker 2>politics after that.</v>

496
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I sort of awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that like what you said there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

498
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Speaker 1>There's that famous orwell quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:24.991
<v Speaker 1>the british working class is in India </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was on bill maher,</v>

500
00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you have a day and like it's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 1>they very much romanticize a bomber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

502
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:35.610
<v Speaker 1>they're very much like the opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like bill miner,</v>

503
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but the opening jokes were very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

504
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:40.660
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

506
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you're not a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like about.</v>

508
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It was very romantic and nostalgic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

509
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And then the subsequent conversation was</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

510
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of about intricacies of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the democratic party in the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>elect candidates now for this is the way</v>

512
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.124
<v Speaker 1>you have trump is because this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't appeal to people on a </v>

513
00:23:58.101 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 1>visceral level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

514
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:00.263
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not addressing the inability of </v>

515
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 1>conventional politics to tell a </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthful,</v>

516
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear story.</v>

517
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:09.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how does politics have to alter is </v>

518
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.380
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you end up in it like that?</v>

519
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Because I think both brexit and trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them more as failures of the left </v>

520
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:21.854
<v Speaker 1>or failures of progressive truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive thinkers as opposed to </v>

521
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.800
<v Speaker 1>triumphs for the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

522
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.683
<v Speaker 1>what is the obligation of progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't use the terms like </v>

523
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.673
<v Speaker 1>lifting rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see how they're becoming </v>

524
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.840
<v Speaker 1>problematic and somewhat redundant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are part of the promo record,</v>

525
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 1>but like this,</v>

526
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.353
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in many ways the trump embracing a </v>

527
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.583
<v Speaker 2>response to the logic of the lift as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well in some ways if you have this </v>

528
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:46.304
<v Speaker 2>national politics that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do we get the next weekend for </v>

529
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 2>the working class in the uk or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>working class in America,</v>

530
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 2>which unfortunately a lot of the lift </v>
<v Speaker 2>has done.</v>

531
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Then being anti immigrant and being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit racist,</v>

532
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.593
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a logical thing that's a logical </v>

533
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.010
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the history of the lift,</v>

534
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.030
<v Speaker 2>particularly of britain as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it really,</v>

535
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really thinking about the trade judy,</v>

536
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:08.660
<v Speaker 2>and think about like people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to social democracy.</v>

537
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 2>My family came to this country on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social democracy.</v>

538
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>They were colored bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get taught in school.</v>

539
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 2>So you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

540
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.490
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to join.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trade union weren't allowed to vote.</v>

541
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm into this association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't live in this area,</v>

542
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:21.974
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

543
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.993
<v Speaker 2>Actually under social democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the racism that we're experiencing now </v>

544
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

545
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like $5 worth right and left wing</v>

546
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>social democracy working class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the racism was far more severe on an</v>

547
00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:34.484
<v Speaker 2>open level than it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some ways these aren't trump and </v>

548
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:39.014
<v Speaker 2>brexit on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

549
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 2>on alien to the lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tool is that if you even corbion got</v>

550
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:43.214
<v Speaker 2>criticized because he never really came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out about brexit and because there is a </v>

551
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:48.140
<v Speaker 2>strong left wing argument that guy can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.890
<v Speaker 2>you want to protect wages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

553
00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:50.724
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of the left is framed </v>

554
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>around the nation state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

555
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 2>How do you protect britiSh workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you protect american workers,</v>

556
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:56.714
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we need to do for the lift </v>

557
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 2>is to have a much more radical approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>to politics.</v>

558
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.713
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like thIs never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at people like eric told </v>

559
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

560
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 2>And neo marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote,</v>

561
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a lot of work to the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>panthers,</v>

562
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 2>american near marxist in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm emmanuel wallace.</v>

563
00:26:13.611 --> 00:26:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Dean talks about world systems theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is,</v>

564
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>there is a theory that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

565
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:17.864
<v Speaker 2>we need to basically divest of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges in the west and really </v>

566
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 2>understanding our place in the global </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that works there.</v>

567
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.003
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't necessarily worked to </v>

568
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 2>influence how politics work.</v>

569
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.190
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean divest of privilege?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like the sound of that</v>

570
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.813
<v Speaker 2>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about acknowledging except as a </v>

571
00:26:38.441 --> 00:26:39.520
<v Speaker 2>black man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

572
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 2>I have to understand that I don't suffer</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the of racism,</v>

573
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

574
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ask him by the police.</v>

575
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I have higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

576
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I am one to most people in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

577
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.413
<v Speaker 2>So I have to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm in a privileged position and I </v>

578
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 2>have to understand also that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the way that privilege come from,</v>

579
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 2>it comes from the exploitation of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that look like me,</v>

580
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.760
<v Speaker 2>which means I then have to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different politics that says,</v>

581
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 2>how do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do,</v>

582
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 2>how do we relate to the least of us in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense?</v>

583
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>How do we draw these global idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

584
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child deaths and politics around the </v>

585
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:13.300
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

586
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

587
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.163
<v Speaker 2>And understanding that I to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to give up my </v>

588
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 2>privilege and this is what people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

589
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why the probably the limit.</v>

590
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:21.414
<v Speaker 2>This is probably why I'll never work </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for us in the west to really </v>

591
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:26.094
<v Speaker 2>have a radical politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will mean we have to give up </v>

592
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 2>privileges and to what extent are people</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do that?</v>

593
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.413
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the power structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetuate all dependent on our </v>

594
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:38.440
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to give up comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

595
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.650
<v Speaker 1>if people had a sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more spiritual,</v>

596
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I would want to say attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>asceticism.</v>

597
00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:46.960
<v Speaker 1>If people were kind of hardened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of no,</v>

598
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I know what's right and you're not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be guiding me with your iphones.</v>

599
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.600
<v Speaker 1>You're going to feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very,</v>

600
00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:54.940
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get there a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week I think.</v>

601
00:27:54.941 --> 00:27:55.774
<v Speaker 1>Would I be more happy if I was to fill </v>
<v Speaker 1>my house with people who were refugees </v>

602
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:00.843
<v Speaker 1>started that I didn't like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would my sum tote of happiness go </v>

603
00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.114
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd send to be spending less time </v>

604
00:28:04.721 --> 00:28:08.490
<v Speaker 1>reflecting on why shouldn't really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>having this privilege should I know,</v>

605
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.413
<v Speaker 1>but much more time we bloody hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We brought the toilet or whatever it </v>

606
00:28:12.461 --> 00:28:13.870
<v Speaker 1>would be that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:28:13.871 --> 00:28:14.704
<v Speaker 1>like so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it requires it that I guaranteed it </v>

608
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.260
<v Speaker 1>this wicked speech about where he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

609
00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:21.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no point in us overflowing </v>

610
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the british then replacing them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable system.</v>

611
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.533
<v Speaker 1>You might have heard this given that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have degree courses in racial politics </v>

612
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.020
<v Speaker 1>like so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bit where he goes like,</v>

613
00:28:32.021 --> 00:28:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is it comes down to the idea of</v>

614
00:28:33.791 --> 00:28:37.840
<v Speaker 1>our attitudes towards comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as We are addicted to comfort,</v>

615
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.170
<v Speaker 1>then it's really hard on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a personal level,</v>

616
00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where.</v>

617
00:28:42.911 --> 00:28:44.260
<v Speaker 1>This isn't theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where.</v>

618
00:28:44.261 --> 00:28:45.380
<v Speaker 1>This isn't something you read about </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

619
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.160
<v Speaker 1>scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I prepared to give up my only phone?</v>

620
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Would I be happier if I had less stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

621
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.430
<v Speaker 1>On some level I sort of feel I would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what prevent.</v>

622
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of fear though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed that prevents me from going,</v>

623
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to walk out into,</v>

624
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.963
<v Speaker 1>because I suppose my personal privilege </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wealth is what I feel protects me </v>

625
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.500
<v Speaker 1>from this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this world.</v>

626
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

627
00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I can see why people don't quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 2>people know who wants to give up stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

629
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And particularly if you work in glass to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you a blank,</v>

630
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use this discrimination,</v>

631
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:17.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're seeing that is clearly unequal.</v>

632
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly not fair and we fill it </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly treated as well.</v>

633
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 2>So that's also part of the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

634
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.600
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to give up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This have worked quite hard to get it as</v>

635
00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately that's the reality.</v>

636
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Huey newton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black panther is a,</v>

637
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.290
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a revolutionary suicide.</v>

638
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 2>They said this is what revolution is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

639
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Understanding that you have to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give up for those people who are,</v>

640
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.780
<v Speaker 2>who are less than Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White.</v>

641
00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I have very little faith in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in europe.</v>

642
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

643
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.273
<v Speaker 2>the concept we always talk about as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical concept is blackness because </v>

644
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:47.074
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my blackness is the way that I look at </v>

645
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the hair is the,</v>

646
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a connection to people who are at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the literal bottle.</v>

647
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 2>So when we talk about the child that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dies every 10 seconds,</v>

648
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of those already in </v>
<v Speaker 2>africa.</v>

649
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.803
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that gives me a connection that you </v>

650
00:29:58.841 --> 00:29:59.674
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't necessarily have right </v>

651
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:01.444
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that should give me a connection I </v>

652
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 2>should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that should tie me into politics and</v>

653
00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:06.750
<v Speaker 2>remind me this is a global struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a national struggle,</v>

654
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:07.743
<v Speaker 2>which is why I have a bit more faith in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of was kind of black </v>

655
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 2>movements then I would have in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the us and european movement.</v>

656
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.713
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

657
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.883
<v Speaker 1>if however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only people that care about that </v>

658
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.093
<v Speaker 1>exploitation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the most severe form such as </v>

659
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:24.424
<v Speaker 1>child deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people that have a visible and </v>

660
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.873
<v Speaker 1>cultural identification with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even then it remainS theoretical </v>

661
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:32.764
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

662
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 1>To what degree are you involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activism?</v>

663
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is anything going to change?</v>

664
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.923
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that until you get to </v>

665
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 1>that point that huey newton point about </v>
<v Speaker 1>self sacrifice,</v>

666
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 1>which is really martyrdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an idea that again,</v>

667
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 1>is resourced from theology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

668
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.303
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how without a spiritual component is </v>

669
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:53.614
<v Speaker 1>radical radical change going to occur </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how the human beings access </v>

670
00:30:56.771 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 1>ideas such as one less true for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternity transcendence,</v>

671
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 1>relinquishing individual identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>through social and cultural like or,</v>

672
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 1>or material forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how'd you go?</v>

673
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.923
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't have the necessary </v>

674
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 1>potency is not emotive enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem.</v>

675
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

676
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 2>there's two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

677
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.243
<v Speaker 2>one I think in terms of you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black struggle and that kind of global </v>

678
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:20.850
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people at friends fan on a.</v>

679
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.693
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about the idea that user who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a martinican I'm postcolonial </v>

680
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:26.014
<v Speaker 2>theorist and he will talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you need to sleeping beauty of the </v>

681
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:29.164
<v Speaker 2>european working class to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically and you need those allies to </v>

682
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:32.254
<v Speaker 2>have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

683
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 2>this revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the panthers would,</v>

684
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 2>would have said this because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>marxists.</v>

685
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of like you said that you need </v>

686
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:42.440
<v Speaker 2>to have this almost spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something beyond just rationality,</v>

687
00:31:42.441 --> 00:31:44.090
<v Speaker 2>something more than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

688
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.630
<v Speaker 2>this is why I say it's probably never </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen,</v>

689
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

690
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.523
<v Speaker 2>we have a system which has always </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected the western working class who </v>

691
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.303
<v Speaker 2>always from the worst exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a provided comfort and wealth and </v>

692
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 2>provided it as an outlet.</v>

693
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 2>So look at the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're saying,</v>

694
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:56.944
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we just get a bigger share of the </v>

695
00:31:58.211 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 2>pie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not can we change global poverty?</v>

696
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Can we get a big share of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

697
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd be unlikely to see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

698
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 2>but can you see that kind of more </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional if you like,</v>

699
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>theological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual in this concept of blackness.</v>

700
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 2>This is why log.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

701
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:10.440
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

702
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a potential possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rather than wait and try and get the</v>

703
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:15.790
<v Speaker 2>allyship of people who are dumping </v>
<v Speaker 2>river,</v>

704
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.653
<v Speaker 2>going to have massive allergy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just go with what we have and </v>

705
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>organize what we have and produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that can actually this,</v>

706
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.223
<v Speaker 2>that by itself would be enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing and kick the bucket a </v>

707
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

708
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

709
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

710
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.143
<v Speaker 1>it's more entrenched in precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it's inability to transcend </v>

711
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.023
<v Speaker 1>systems of categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been previously established </v>

712
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.130
<v Speaker 1>by the power dynamic that you seek to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overflow.</v>

713
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

714
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 2>because that's</v>

715
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about blackness.</v>

716
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways that you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the critique,</v>

717
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.803
<v Speaker 1>we get a lot lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is racial categories that are from </v>

718
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:47.471
<v Speaker 1>europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>

719
00:32:47.471 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

720
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.370
<v Speaker 1>But actually blackness is concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about.</v>

721
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It's really the opposite to race a race </v>
<v Speaker 1>is about biology is about hierarchy.</v>

722
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's about europeans looking at us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

723
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.420
<v Speaker 1>you are not really human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blackness is,</v>

724
00:32:59.421 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is looking at each other and going,</v>

725
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

726
00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 1>We've probably gotten the same african </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

727
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:04.680
<v Speaker 1>We've got that dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

728
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing these europeans are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these terrible things.</v>

729
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to categorize it in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and we're going to reject that.</v>

730
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So blackness isn't a bad hierarchies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad.</v>

731
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:12.854
<v Speaker 1>Biology isn't about genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about saying there's a shared </v>

732
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.710
<v Speaker 1>shared meaning of color that's a shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of politics.</v>

733
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And we come together and organize in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to benefit the community.</v>

734
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.650
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't have those elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

735
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.903
<v Speaker 1>so it's a different concept for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now shifting the idea of reparations </v>

736
00:33:32.381 --> 00:33:34.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's a practical idea.</v>

737
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.193
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk to him about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for western wealth is founded on </v>

738
00:33:37.751 --> 00:33:38.584
<v Speaker 1>colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there could be a redemptive </v>

739
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.790
<v Speaker 1>mentions or is that idea?</v>

740
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.621
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

741
00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 2>So if basically if you look through </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>

742
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.233
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear and very obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealth of the west is built on </v>

743
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 2>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colonialism and genocide,</v>

744
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 2>like very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you just take slavery,</v>

745
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean slavery is about 300 year system,</v>

746
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places like britain.</v>

747
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:01.590
<v Speaker 2>America is literally built off the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

748
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Parts of london.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liverpool wouldn't really exist.</v>

749
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Glasgow in scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scotland to get off the slavery.</v>

750
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:07.814
<v Speaker 2>But my son name's andrews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that should tell you everything you </v>

751
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 2>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery and scotland,</v>

752
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 2>birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even because it was not a poor we get,</v>

753
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:18.710
<v Speaker 2>we tend to get away as well from some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these slavery stink if you like,</v>

754
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 2>but the industry evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>james,</v>

755
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 2>what matthew boat and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavily involved in slavery,</v>

756
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 2>took lots and lots of money from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

757
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.610
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>

758
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.750
<v Speaker 2>which is typically seen to be the marker</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the west right,</v>

759
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 2>and how progressive it is and scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>cetera,</v>

760
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:34.394
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the first real commodity that was </v>

761
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 2>made in just revolution was cotton and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cotton grown in britain.</v>

762
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't grow on it.</v>

763
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:42.824
<v Speaker 2>They got caught and was in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in the caribbean and so is that </v>

764
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 2>that commodity and that wealth from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the cotton industry,</v>

765
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:48.764
<v Speaker 2>which was from the slave trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really gets reinvested back into </v>

766
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:51.764
<v Speaker 2>the industrial revolution and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're able to have the rest of the </v>

767
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

768
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.083
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the money that you needed to have </v>

769
00:34:56.391 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 2>something like the industry revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>is 100 percent tied up into,</v>

770
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 2>into slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tHat's what we mean.</v>

771
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:02.271
<v Speaker 2>Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

772
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.104
<v Speaker 2>made some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some large proportion of all the guns </v>

773
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>and all the shackles that were used in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire slaved rate.</v>

774
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.070
<v Speaker 2>We only made the guns in shackles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were barely involved.</v>

775
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>British ships,</v>

776
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>british,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even things like,</v>

777
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finance capitalism,</v>

778
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.150
<v Speaker 2>insurance starts with the slave trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd's of london,</v>

779
00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:22.984
<v Speaker 2>you celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 400 years anniversary of </v>

780
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ceo comes on tv and says we're happy</v>

781
00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 2>to have our roots in ensuring the </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchant trade.</v>

782
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 2>And what she meant was literally the </v>
<v Speaker 2>slave trade.</v>

783
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slave trading in lloyd's of london,</v>

784
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:37.094
<v Speaker 2>the merchant rate psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just a few ships tried to sporting </v>

785
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.323
<v Speaker 2>goods.</v>

786
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.320
<v Speaker 2>So you can see the roots of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financial institutions are cities ever.</v>

787
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 2>You probably couldn't have much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that we have today with it,</v>

788
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.843
<v Speaker 2>without slavery.</v>

789
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

790
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one component in it,</v>

791
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:00.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

792
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of creating excess value at excess </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

793
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 1>SO anythiNg you can do to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>overheads,</v>

794
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.563
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we found ways of reducing the next </v>

795
00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.510
<v Speaker 1>stuff from other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get other people to work for no money at</v>

796
00:36:14.511 --> 00:36:15.740
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>

797
00:36:15.741 --> 00:36:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the all the line and the unicorn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the land and the hope of glory.</v>

798
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it,</v>

799
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:22.723
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's 100 percent and what it </v>

800
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.900
<v Speaker 2>does consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you think about reparations in</v>

801
00:36:26.901 --> 00:36:27.734
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of this work has been done in </v>

802
00:36:28.491 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 2>America and they tried to calculate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

803
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty strong legal precedence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 300 years of unpaid,</v>

804
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.953
<v Speaker 2>unpaid labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just work out what the labor would </v>

805
00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 2>have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the cost would have been,</v>

806
00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:40.250
<v Speaker 2>what people should have got paid for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>work that they did.</v>

807
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also a precedence </v>

808
00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 2>around trauma and abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for exAmple,</v>

809
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.400
<v Speaker 2>for the holocaust he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

810
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.473
<v Speaker 2>germany's paid airbags like $90 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that because the </v>

811
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.113
<v Speaker 2>numbers are maybe more than germany's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually paid out reparations for the </v>

812
00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:53.504
<v Speaker 2>harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was cool.</v>

813
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.823
<v Speaker 2>So let me say these two categories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that you've got to pay for unpaid </v>

814
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:57.920
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to pay for trauma.</v>

815
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the states,</v>

816
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.194
<v Speaker 2>they reckon it's anywhere between four </v>
<v Speaker 2>point nine and 15 point 6 billion </v>

817
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.190
<v Speaker 2>trillion trillion dollars that's owed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>african americans.</v>

818
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:13.320
<v Speaker 1>It would essentially unravel that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation,</v>

819
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:14.154
<v Speaker 1>that system as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it can't be countenanced </v>

820
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 1>thought discussed because you can't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America.</v>

821
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:20.161
<v Speaker 1>Now that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

822
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:20.994
<v Speaker 1>we're framing it economically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read this wicked thing off of </v>

823
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A native american,</v>

824
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:26.620
<v Speaker 1>he called himself or maybe even of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indiana,</v>

825
00:37:26.621 --> 00:37:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

826
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.020
<v Speaker 1>like activist and he said all these sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of systems,</v>

827
00:37:31.021 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't come up with marxism </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

828
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:36.010
<v Speaker 1>they're all sort of your ideas when in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and none of them were best.</v>

829
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We have a completely different framework</v>
<v Speaker 1>for understanding reality.</v>

830
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that with something like</v>

831
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.470
<v Speaker 1>reparation that what begins to unravel a</v>
<v Speaker 1>national identity,</v>

832
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.363
<v Speaker 1>it will curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought in that James Baldwin </v>

833
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:52.614
<v Speaker 1>documentary where he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the whole category of negro is </v>

834
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.500
<v Speaker 1>required in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

835
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>the doormen and pat the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant power,</v>

836
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of force to have,</v>

837
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

838
00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity to cast a shadow onto that.</v>

839
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>That category is created in order for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiteness to prevail,</v>

840
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 1>not only economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also kind of psychologically because</v>

841
00:38:19.411 --> 00:38:20.244
<v Speaker 1>in a way economics is there sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>external system that comes from </v>

842
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.940
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as,</v>

843
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 1>for all forms of categorization master </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

844
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.013
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I suppose one of the things that </v>

845
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.653
<v Speaker 1>we're arguing these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no essence to categorization </v>

846
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.624
<v Speaker 1>these external forms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospectively except for that moment </v>

847
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:37.024
<v Speaker 1>where you talked about blackness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>having some veracity in terms of visual </v>

848
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>

849
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I was sayiNg then the um,</v>

850
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

851
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.770
<v Speaker 1>like with that reparation argument you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

852
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense like what would happen if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you,</v>

853
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.910
<v Speaker 1>pursue that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that go?</v>

854
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well guess this is,</v>

855
00:38:58.341 --> 00:38:59.174
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

856
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.120
<v Speaker 2>the cool de sac of reparations is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>word to put it.</v>

857
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:03.963
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So logically there's no real argument </v>

858
00:39:05.471 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 2>against reparations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at.</v>

859
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 2>So you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people talk about,</v>

860
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>oh it was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things have passed,</v>

861
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.283
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

862
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 2>But actually the effects is still very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

863
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:13.804
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear.</v>

864
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.690
<v Speaker 2>not just what are the descendants of </v>
<v Speaker 2>enslaved but also in africa.</v>

865
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the populating africa today,</v>

866
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 2>extend alone has had a huge negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact on the economy so you can see the</v>

867
00:39:23.051 --> 00:39:23.884
<v Speaker 2>effects of slavery as though their </v>
<v Speaker 2>reparations were paid to the slave </v>

868
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:28.414
<v Speaker 2>owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that and actually gave her </v>

869
00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 2>praises tO this label because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was that much money involved.</v>

870
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 2>They will have to give me some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

871
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.863
<v Speaker 2>They serve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

872
00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Losing single slaves must be terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardship.</v>

873
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a.</v>

874
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>You'd a ucl unIversity college london,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a legacy of british slavery project</v>

875
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.673
<v Speaker 2>and they've traced where the equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 2 billion pounds that went to the </v>

876
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:48.844
<v Speaker 2>british owners of slaves at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emancipation wind and you can see it's </v>

877
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:54.370
<v Speaker 2>in the church is in the middle classes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in david cameron's family.</v>

878
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 2>It's literally forever for the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very clear there's a problem and</v>

879
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be restitution paid for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

880
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 2>but you're right though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start to add up these numbers,</v>

881
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it's 15 trillIon in in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

882
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.770
<v Speaker 2>what would that be for the uk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talking about?</v>

883
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

884
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 2>It's literally impossible for the west </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay these kind of sum of money.</v>

885
00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It would destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would destroy us.</v>

886
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.963
<v Speaker 1>There is no west in order to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the west has to dismantle </v>

887
00:40:21.261 --> 00:40:22.490
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power,</v>

888
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.383
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't all arguments about power reach </v>

889
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.023
<v Speaker 1>this nexus that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for the power to respond </v>

890
00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:30.044
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to dismantle itself </v>

891
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:33.080
<v Speaker 1>whether you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you're talking about a transnational</v>

892
00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're too matt lloyd's,</v>

893
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.473
<v Speaker 1>lloyd's in order to behave rationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>and acknowledge its origins would have </v>

894
00:40:39.531 --> 00:40:43.160
<v Speaker 1>to not be lloyds anymore or gmo for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

895
00:40:43.161 --> 00:40:45.740
<v Speaker 1>they were putting out cars they knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to catch fire,</v>

896
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but it works out cheaper to let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

897
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 1>The only sort of possible responses for </v>
<v Speaker 1>there not to me.</v>

898
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.103
<v Speaker 1>So the systemic changes required are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute that they in a sense defy the </v>

899
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:58.540
<v Speaker 1>dynamic because it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

900
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.230
<v Speaker 1>if you say right America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>britain,</v>

901
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.350
<v Speaker 1>colonial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former colonial or colonial nations have</v>

902
00:41:03.351 --> 00:41:04.190
<v Speaker 1>to repeat it.</v>

903
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.093
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I feel like is that </v>

904
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:07.500
<v Speaker 1>transference of wealth to africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

905
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.443
<v Speaker 1>unless there is systemic change or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now is now the dominant forces </v>

906
00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:17.360
<v Speaker 1>within africa behave in that way and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a way isn't it a bit of a red air in,</v>

907
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.600
<v Speaker 1>in that it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is it still happening,</v>

908
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.150
<v Speaker 1>are sort of very simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unproductive but bloody hell.</v>

909
00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 1>What did you expect when you came on in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

910
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.630
<v Speaker 1>like sort of my argument is a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people sort of.</v>

911
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It goes a bit like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

912
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't have slavery no more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like it's bothering too many.</v>

913
00:41:32.061 --> 00:41:33.780
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got influence,</v>

914
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.120
<v Speaker 2>but what we can have is will pay people </v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute bare minimum.</v>

915
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.410
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a subjugated under cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So things just move on.</v>

916
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.433
<v Speaker 2>If power finds a way of manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself continually and making the </v>

917
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.053
<v Speaker 2>minimum compromises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I think this is where the </v>

918
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.873
<v Speaker 2>power of the reparations argument you </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow it through to its logical </v>

919
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:56.204
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you that the problem is </v>

920
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 2>irresolvable within our political and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic system,</v>

921
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.853
<v Speaker 2>and this is where you need to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical change and actually what we </v>

922
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:06.380
<v Speaker 2>should be organized will revolutionize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the change you need to have.</v>

923
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Their institution needs to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be made in this.</v>

924
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to quote medical mix.</v>

925
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this system is,</v>

926
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to have freedom,</v>

927
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:14.444
<v Speaker 2>justice and equality for black people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way that it's impossible for a </v>

928
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 2>chicken to late a duck egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not meant to happen.</v>

929
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.423
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once we realized it will start </v>

930
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 2>thinking of much bigger solutions to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

931
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:25.791
<v Speaker 2>that's the power of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

932
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:26.624
<v Speaker 2>that's a pair of their operations </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument to tell you how see how's </v>

933
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 2>embedded in the system is actually quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

934
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:31.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

935
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Because it leads you to the point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

936
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.291
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hang on a minute.</v>

937
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 2>If you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be no America.</v>

938
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.390
<v Speaker 2>And then that tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

939
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>America is therefore built on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

940
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:41.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's think about different solutions</v>

941
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 2>and when you think about power manifests</v>
<v Speaker 2>and inch and giving concessions,</v>

942
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of what we see with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reparations debate.</v>

943
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.723
<v Speaker 2>So carrie con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a caribbean collection of </v>

944
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.173
<v Speaker 2>caribbean countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are currently arguing for reparations </v>

945
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and there they've kind of stopped asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for money.</v>

946
00:42:56.511 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Now it's about can we get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>development aid?</v>

947
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Can we get an apology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we get some education,</v>

948
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.490
<v Speaker 2>will do tHe apology for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

949
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a different set of demands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of demands that the west could do,</v>

950
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not impossible.</v>

951
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:14.450
<v Speaker 2>They could do this and then it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolve them of theIr guilt to say,</v>

952
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:14.751
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

953
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:15.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we apologize.</v>

954
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:17.500
<v Speaker 2>We gave you this development aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wiped off third ward did,</v>

955
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.060
<v Speaker 2>but it actually didn't change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

956
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Problem is doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issues are still there.</v>

957
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:21.794
<v Speaker 2>The structures are still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can actually do reparations in a </v>

958
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 2>way that makes things worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not better.</v>

959
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

960
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.543
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like it's one of those spreads </v>

961
00:43:29.621 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 2>that if you pull out it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart.</v>

962
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.100
<v Speaker 2>It makes me your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what kind of,</v>

963
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to spend the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

964
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might not know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

965
00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 2>what were your most immediate objectives</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of bringing about change?</v>

966
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Where do you like now that you know all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff now,</v>

967
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 2>the teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the staff in your position,</v>

968
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:48.730
<v Speaker 2>you're in what you're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

969
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>so I think in terms of the book I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out next year,</v>

970
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 2>black black radicalism is a manifesto of</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory theoretically,</v>

971
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:57.404
<v Speaker 2>but also practically they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually what is black radicalism </v>

972
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this politics do?</v>

973
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.663
<v Speaker 2>What does it lead us to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where it leads us to is to an </v>

974
00:44:03.171 --> 00:44:04.004
<v Speaker 2>organization that transcends a nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>state that connects us to the poorest </v>

975
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>and the most abject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that condition.</v>

976
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And so it's actually less work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>building revolution.</v>

977
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.040
<v Speaker 2>and so it's kind of built on 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when malcolm x,</v>

978
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.913
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably have mentioned malcolm like </v>

979
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 2>10 more times before we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we finished where malcolm dies,</v>

980
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 2>he's working on the organization of afro</v>
<v Speaker 2>american unity.</v>

981
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:22.263
<v Speaker 2>He says this organization is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the revolutionary organization </v>

982
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 2>because you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a place here,</v>

983
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you have a place in New York place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>caribbean,</v>

984
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:29.474
<v Speaker 2>a place in Jamaica replacing and garner </v>
<v Speaker 2>a place in all over the world and you </v>

985
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.563
<v Speaker 2>connect this organization together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've got that kind of unity and </v>

986
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 2>solidarity across borders.</v>

987
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 2>They can actually have a proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary change.</v>

988
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>so this is the word I'm trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently.</v>

989
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the significance of</v>

990
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:49.510
<v Speaker 1>malcolm x's islam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it was a muslim.</v>

991
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.723
<v Speaker 1>It was a lack of proper cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a devout muslim like you because </v>

992
00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.400
<v Speaker 1>you're coming at him from the angle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a black man in england.</v>

993
00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:02.680
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

994
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.553
<v Speaker 1>like isn't as much or could it be argued</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is it a muslim icon as well as a </v>

995
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>african american or black icon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how did those categories in a sec,</v>

996
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.440
<v Speaker 1>particularly in a climate where </v>
<v Speaker 1>islamaphobia,</v>

997
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>so president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

998
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.560
<v Speaker 1>so I think malcolm question came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

999
00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Being a muslim is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not incidental,</v>

1000
00:45:20.921 --> 00:45:22.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually malcolm,</v>

1001
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.010
<v Speaker 2>when malcolm becomes really radical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some outcomes in the nation of islam for</v>

1002
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.620
<v Speaker 2>about 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years when he comes out of prison and</v>

1003
00:45:29.621 --> 00:45:30.454
<v Speaker 2>it transforms him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the nation of islam is very much a </v>

1004
00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:34.294
<v Speaker 2>religious organization in that he says </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the solution to people's problems </v>

1005
00:45:36.791 --> 00:45:38.860
<v Speaker 2>is to become muslim and that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1006
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.713
<v Speaker 2>You just become muslim and as a prophecy</v>
<v Speaker 2>where god's going to wipe away all the </v>

1007
00:45:42.161 --> 00:45:42.994
<v Speaker 2>white people and we'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to do is be muslim and he </v>

1008
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.140
<v Speaker 2>sees that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of religion,</v>

1009
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.033
<v Speaker 2>whether it's islam or christianity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you don't want to </v>

1010
00:45:50.531 --> 00:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>have basically because it limits you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really do anything.</v>

1011
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.320
<v Speaker 2>You just pray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eventually malcolm leaves because he</v>

1012
00:45:56.321 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 2>sees the limits of any because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a sunni sunni,</v>

1013
00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 2>sunni muslim.</v>

1014
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.580
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1015
00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:03.890
<v Speaker 2>he goes to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes to maker.</v>

1016
00:46:03.891 --> 00:46:04.724
<v Speaker 2>He has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a different kind of islam and he </v>

1017
00:46:07.211 --> 00:46:12.211
<v Speaker 2>becomes in many ways more developed so </v>
<v Speaker 2>he finds the mosley must incorporate,</v>

1018
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.600
<v Speaker 2>but very clearly in the ballot or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet speech in [inaudible] 64.</v>

1019
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.610
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start a speech,</v>

1020
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.300
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1021
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm a muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to leave your religion at </v>

1022
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:22.114
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your religion between you and your </v>

1023
00:46:22.991 --> 00:46:23.824
<v Speaker 2>gut because this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what we're talking about </v>

1024
00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:26.643
<v Speaker 2>when we do this organization work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is black people stuff and you can </v>

1025
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:32.020
<v Speaker 2>be whatever religion you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has no impact on the politics.</v>

1026
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.150
<v Speaker 2>So malcolm makes it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clear separation.</v>

1027
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.163
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that was a political move </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that there was actually a </v>

1028
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.253
<v Speaker 1>trenchant christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even black population in America that </v>

1029
00:46:38.681 --> 00:46:39.514
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to caUse a rift in that </v>

1030
00:46:41.111 --> 00:46:41.944
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think</v>

1031
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:42.803
<v Speaker 2>so important philosophically because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he's saying he's just saying that </v>

1032
00:46:44.481 --> 00:46:45.314
<v Speaker 2>religion is that religion is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes you connect to the world and </v>

1033
00:46:49.191 --> 00:46:50.024
<v Speaker 2>makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you spirituality and it gives </v>

1034
00:46:51.021 --> 00:46:53.630
<v Speaker 2>you something personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religion is not something that can solve</v>

1035
00:46:53.631 --> 00:46:54.710
<v Speaker 2>any of our problems on earth.</v>

1036
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:55.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

1037
00:46:55.551 --> 00:46:56.384
<v Speaker 1>to me mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the big argument of secularism that </v>

1038
00:46:58.251 --> 00:47:00.110
<v Speaker 1>religion is a private matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1039
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.243
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1040
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.833
<v Speaker 1>whereas I think of like spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not religion because it's such a hot </v>

1041
00:47:05.391 --> 00:47:06.224
<v Speaker 1>potato as having the motivational power </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring about the kind of revolution </v>

1042
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.730
<v Speaker 1>revolution that's required because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1043
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're sort of when you sort of get </v>

1044
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:15.643
<v Speaker 1>start to tee up on that precipice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll take into by thinking when you </v>

1045
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:20.870
<v Speaker 1>pursue that reparation argument when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1046
00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:21.704
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would mean the dismantling of the </v>

1047
00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:23.580
<v Speaker 1>entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1048
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:24.443
<v Speaker 1>europe as we understand it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States of America as we </v>

1049
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:27.704
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also sort of revealed he didn't </v>

1050
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 1>narratives the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that power transcends nation has</v>

1051
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:33.334
<v Speaker 1>continued historically massed by flags </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our own willingness to participate </v>

1052
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:37.804
<v Speaker 1>in their rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's consumer rituals or daft </v>

1053
00:47:39.781 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>secular holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly all of this is exposed.</v>

1054
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if you're asking people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take on board ideas as radical as you</v>

1055
00:47:47.071 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as simple as radical,</v>

1056
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 1>as seemingly trivial as put down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and start caring about little kids</v>

1057
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 1>down a mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way they're going to do that is</v>

1058
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 1>we have some connection to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>

1059
00:47:57.551 --> 00:47:58.384
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I obviously say this is a white </v>

1060
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:01.654
<v Speaker 1>person and I was really enjoying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment mate where I was talking to you </v>

1061
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.840
<v Speaker 1>about malcolm x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1062
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:06.280
<v Speaker 1>there's bits where I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradict you.</v>

1063
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good stuff.</v>

1064
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Professor of black studies now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet again on the subject of malcolm x,</v>

1065
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.580
<v Speaker 1>my feeling is that people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to find a resource that's extremely</v>

1066
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 1>potent in order to countenance such </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

1067
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 1>And I know the civil rights movement in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its origins,</v>

1068
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:30.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of them early student type </v>

1069
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:34.130
<v Speaker 1>prOtests where then girls got murdered </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

1070
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read the brilliant thing.</v>

1071
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it bothered that malcolm </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackboard.</v>

1072
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:38.703
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty good pop thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying that the kind of </v>

1073
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:40.564
<v Speaker 1>allegiances were formed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what sort of local communal and </v>

1074
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:43.954
<v Speaker 1>tight and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an essay on house or the </v>

1075
00:48:45.371 --> 00:48:48.820
<v Speaker 1>limitations of social media and how like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need sort of proper connections,</v>

1076
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but then people also were christian in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>

1077
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were other sort of like they were </v>

1078
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.023
<v Speaker 1>transcendent belief systems like whereas</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said very plainly and overtly there </v>

1079
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 1>boldly that religions not going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1080
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't feel like,</v>

1081
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

1082
00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very evident to me the way that religion</v>

1083
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:07.054
<v Speaker 1>is used to sort of categorize subjugate </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided to the shame and all those </v>

1084
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:11.404
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like how can we transcend </v>

1085
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:14.403
<v Speaker 1>these systems of categorization unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is by saying they read some essence </v>

1086
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:20.250
<v Speaker 1>to the self and some essence to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world.</v>

1087
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1088
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:21.970
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1089
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Even even with malcolm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

1090
00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:24.304
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>split the two you couldn't separate is </v>

1091
00:49:25.681 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 2>islam from his politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1092
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that does motivate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to do things.</v>

1093
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.513
<v Speaker 2>I think the key thing is to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't one religious answer and I </v>

1094
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:34.294
<v Speaker 2>think that's what math was basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to say is if you're a christian </v>

1095
00:49:35.911 --> 00:49:37.780
<v Speaker 2>and these motivate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a muslim is motivate you.</v>

1096
00:49:37.781 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 2>If you were jewish and it motivates you </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever religion you are,</v>

1097
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 2>we use that to motivate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually in terms of the program,</v>

1098
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:44.434
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what we're going to do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of where we go next in terms of </v>

1099
00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 2>the alliances that we make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion just going to get into weight.</v>

1100
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1101
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:51.363
<v Speaker 2>and separate and saying that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earthly problems that we have with </v>

1102
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 2>the problems that we have and in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses blackness.</v>

1103
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.183
<v Speaker 2>The way malcolm talks about the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about it has that version of </v>

1104
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 2>spirituality to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that other connection to it</v>

1105
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:02.703
<v Speaker 1>been the same way as you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that malcolm x meant when he was saying </v>

1106
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.083
<v Speaker 1>religion will get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was ultimately a rice get in the </v>

1107
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:10.744
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If like if you take your argument of </v>

1108
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:13.084
<v Speaker 1>blackness as the motivate in a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond for a sort of a revolutionary </v>

1109
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:18.170
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1110
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.530
<v Speaker 1>where does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the goal of that?</v>

1111
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Where does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've won the war.</v>

1112
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is always like I guess if </v>

1113
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:28.034
<v Speaker 2>you look at malcolm's politics will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary panafricanism at the </v>

1114
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:31.184
<v Speaker 2>african revolution and in and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of when you've got rid of europe </v>

1115
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 2>and China is agitating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got different economy,</v>

1116
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you've got politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1117
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 2>But that's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never been the end for that.</v>

1118
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Politics always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1119
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:42.933
<v Speaker 2>african and black people in general </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact pot in the global revolution </v>

1120
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.700
<v Speaker 2>because we ain't got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't have anything sweet.</v>

1121
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.553
<v Speaker 2>Or where was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody at kohl's on I'm blabbing have </v>

1122
00:50:49.661 --> 00:50:50.494
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you have a power base and If </v>

1123
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 2>you could do this revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that revolution could.</v>

1124
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 2>That would firstly probably undermine </v>
<v Speaker 2>western capitalism to the point he would</v>

1125
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 2>no longer exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would give you the ability to,</v>

1126
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.060
<v Speaker 2>to join in with other revolutions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other groups and other and support those</v>

1127
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:03.410
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the black,</v>

1128
00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 2>the black revolution is if you let the </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting point to the global revolution,</v>

1129
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 2>but you have to have that black </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution first.</v>

1130
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I guess the argument.</v>

1131
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of my.</v>

1132
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>

1133
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.683
<v Speaker 1>why would it have to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that has to be at the level of </v>

1134
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the most oppressed or most severe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1135
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.471
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1136
00:51:19.471 --> 00:51:20.304
<v Speaker 2>I guess in theory you could have say the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equistar in China because the other </v>

1137
00:51:22.111 --> 00:51:23.850
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we're saying look from a,</v>

1138
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.110
<v Speaker 2>from a black perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say look,</v>

1139
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:25.973
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also if you take that logic of the </v>

1140
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.190
<v Speaker 2>most severe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst depression,</v>

1141
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.770
<v Speaker 2>there is a strong argument for africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that place.</v>

1142
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose my motivating because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

1143
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:34.543
<v Speaker 1>economic ramifications as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if africa as a continent says we </v>

1144
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 1>don't want trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of that,</v>

1145
00:51:41.451 --> 00:51:44.890
<v Speaker 1>we want a clean slate from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a bloody hell when you think about</v>

1146
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that debt cancellation stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a.</v>

1147
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.740
<v Speaker 2>And as an active large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes we will cancel that debt.</v>

1148
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.633
<v Speaker 2>What we give you by nikudos stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like an act of kindness is it </v>

1149
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:59.350
<v Speaker 2>has in stopping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in adding insult to injury,</v>

1150
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.180
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep going back up again,</v>

1151
00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but he's a great and in the metaphors he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1152
00:52:02.981 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stab me in the back and then pull</v>

1153
00:52:05.861 --> 00:52:08.050
<v Speaker 2>out a knife six inches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I can't.</v>

1154
00:52:08.051 --> 00:52:08.884
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this one day cancellation </v>

1155
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.230
<v Speaker 2>effectively is like pulling out a knife </v>
<v Speaker 2>six inches.</v>

1156
00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:14.403
<v Speaker 2>The knife still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't told him that you haven't </v>

1157
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:15.874
<v Speaker 2>changed the debt cancellation debt in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place was just a neo-colonial </v>

1158
00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 2>tool to keep people in a nice no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So none of the things that the west will</v>

1159
00:52:21.851 --> 00:52:25.090
<v Speaker 2>ever offer you is really is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving the problem.</v>

1160
00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You've got to take the knife out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heal the wound.</v>

1161
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:30.220
<v Speaker 1>How do you get on with making these </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments outside of academia?</v>

1162
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:35.250
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get on with a young black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are not within academia?</v>

1163
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:39.700
<v Speaker 1>How do you convey these kinds of ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember too?</v>

1164
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

1165
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the same.</v>

1166
00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:43.800
<v Speaker 2>So like we started the organization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>black unity,</v>

1167
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.960
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the root of it.</v>

1168
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So we took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally took malcolm when he died,</v>

1169
00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:49.643
<v Speaker 2>before he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a organization of afro american </v>

1170
00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:52.254
<v Speaker 2>unity as a constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which nobody ever talks about it and it </v>

1171
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:54.630
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1172
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we said,</v>

1173
00:52:56.011 --> 00:52:56.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>

1174
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if it works.</v>

1175
00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And so we're working in birmingham to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to talk to people,</v>

1176
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.430
<v Speaker 2>would talk to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older people.</v>

1177
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in an early stage,</v>

1178
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.273
<v Speaker 2>but we know we're constantly having </v>
<v Speaker 2>these conversations as like campus on </v>

1179
00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:08.334
<v Speaker 2>campus as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll be probably not surprised </v>

1180
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.100
<v Speaker 2>people relate to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People understand them.</v>

1181
00:53:12.101 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 2>People get this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This world doesn't,</v>

1182
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:15.570
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even provide for them.</v>

1183
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I suppose even if you don't </v>

1184
00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:19.270
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know it,</v>

1185
00:53:19.271 --> 00:53:23.230
<v Speaker 1>we've knowledge as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a in terms of information.</v>

1186
00:53:23.231 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1187
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 1>somehow know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1188
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 1>in your gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something I think in people that</v>

1189
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 1>resigns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1190
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 1>when people talk a lot about political </v>
<v Speaker 1>apathy,</v>

1191
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like it's not apathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it rational?</v>

1192
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that</v>

1193
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've participate in that.</v>

1194
00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people don't.</v>

1195
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 2>We haven't given people the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be involved,</v>

1196
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 2>particularly in radical politics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical politics.</v>

1197
00:53:45.391 --> 00:53:46.224
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical has become a bad word in </v>

1198
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:47.911
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1199
00:53:47.911 --> 00:53:50.800
<v Speaker 2>We throw it around about islam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and etc.</v>

1200
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:51.663
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But actually what we've done with this </v>

1201
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 2>is we've completely misunderstood what </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical is.</v>

1202
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.843
<v Speaker 2>So radical islam and jihadism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism and the complete opposite </v>

1203
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 2>things like completely not believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So extremism is when you take the,</v>

1204
00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:08.250
<v Speaker 2>the basic premise of a society or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and you take it away forever,</v>

1205
00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:09.670
<v Speaker 2>then it makes any sense of ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1206
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.793
<v Speaker 2>That's ms dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're having with these </v>

1207
00:54:12.001 --> 00:54:12.834
<v Speaker 2>terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1208
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.793
<v Speaker 2>That's the same as nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same as christie </v>

1209
00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:15.720
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1210
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And radIcalism is the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 2>radicalism.</v>

1211
00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 2>You take the fundamentals and you reject</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1212
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually I don't want these.</v>

1213
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at capitalism and you say,</v>

1214
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:25.890
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to be a market store.</v>

1215
00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 2>You look at going to be a radical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you rejected.</v>

1216
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:29.423
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense you can't actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical islam because radIcal islam </v>

1217
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.630
<v Speaker 2>would cease to be islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wouldn't be,</v>

1218
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:36.483
<v Speaker 2>would be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've completely conflate extremism </v>

1219
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and radicalism and made radical a dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

1220
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.240
<v Speaker 2>We actually radical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we need to be.</v>

1221
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 2>That's where we need to be pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people toward.</v>

1222
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.383
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a coincidence then you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that word has been deliberately </v>

1223
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 2>tarnished because if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1224
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.490
<v Speaker 2>what's 50 only 50 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1225
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

1226
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.003
<v Speaker 2>People really underestimate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we were on the precipice </v>

1227
00:54:58.981 --> 00:54:59.814
<v Speaker 2>of global revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really if you think of communism </v>

1228
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:05.120
<v Speaker 2>in the east african continent is massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics there.</v>

1229
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 2>South America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

1230
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.793
<v Speaker 2>there was a moment where I look like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>west may not with the maintenance of </v>

1231
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:10.764
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since then they have this literally </v>

1232
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:15.780
<v Speaker 2>destroyed with both violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical violence,</v>

1233
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:18.960
<v Speaker 2>and also symbolic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1234
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.063
<v Speaker 2>destroyed radicalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they told us that radicalism is Bad </v>

1235
00:55:21.811 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 2>relative to the wrong radicalism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

1236
00:55:23.461 --> 00:55:24.294
<v Speaker 2>Radicalism is all these things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed us away from those radical </v>

1237
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:27.054
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really radical movements are the </v>

1238
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:29.520
<v Speaker 2>solution to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these problems.</v>

1239
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.110
<v Speaker 2>The only solution to these problems.</v>

1240
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Can we criticize some contemporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures and you've got some,</v>

1241
00:55:36.171 --> 00:55:39.800
<v Speaker 1>lIke a proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a provocative quotes and stuff.</v>

1242
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Eg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about that theresa may's worse than</v>

1243
00:55:41.901 --> 00:55:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

1244
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>was that provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly it was illogical packet for us.</v>

1245
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1246
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I say quote medical lady said elisha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally,</v>

1247
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I just quote medical books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do call other people as well,</v>

1248
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 2>but he always used to come up that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a paper.</v>

1249
00:55:56.401 --> 00:55:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I've just really literally in a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1250
00:55:58.531 --> 00:56:02.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>malcolm distinguish between the southern</v>

1251
00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:02.954
<v Speaker 2>wolf who is kind of bare their teeth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very aggressive and very Openly </v>

1252
00:56:06.091 --> 00:56:06.924
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to know there the problem </v>

1253
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 2>because they're banging on your head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll shoot you,</v>

1254
00:56:10.561 --> 00:56:11.394
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he actually says that worse in the </v>

1255
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>southern wolf is the northern fox who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tricky,</v>

1256
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 2>who's counting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who tell you,</v>

1257
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.380
<v Speaker 2>tell you everything's fine in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whisper.</v>

1258
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Sweet nothings into your ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really they're just as bad.</v>

1259
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about racism at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1260
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America and the civil rights movement</v>

1261
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 2>is all about the south and it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1262
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 2>the southern wolf was about segregation.</v>

1263
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.881
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1264
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of this overt racism,</v>

1265
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.163
<v Speaker 2>but any of the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know you haven't got legal </v>

1266
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:37.714
<v Speaker 2>segregation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually more segregated in the </v>

1267
00:56:39.161 --> 00:56:41.800
<v Speaker 2>north than it is in the sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look at looking today.</v>

1268
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the police killings.</v>

1269
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.163
<v Speaker 2>They usually in the know of another set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of look at the ghetto that's often not </v>

1270
00:56:47.081 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 2>the same as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even though the north telling you</v>

1271
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:50.404
<v Speaker 2>all these wOnderful tales by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's just as bad and in some ways </v>

1272
00:56:52.431 --> 00:56:53.264
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the kind of thing I was </v>

1273
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 2>saying with the Theresa May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump is very,</v>

1274
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 2>very clearly openly white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

1275
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:03.330
<v Speaker 2>obviously quite proud of it seemingly.</v>

1276
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a white supremacist racism that was</v>

1277
00:57:06.471 --> 00:57:08.030
<v Speaker 1>revealed with that charlottesville </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

1278
00:57:08.031 --> 00:57:09.470
<v Speaker 1>or is there other stuff that</v>

1279
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.093
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties there was a big case in </v>

1280
00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 2>central park where there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1281
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.280
<v Speaker 2>there was a rape in central park and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

1282
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.620
<v Speaker 2>it was pinned on a group of gang raid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1283
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.750
<v Speaker 2>these african americans gangs were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly gang raped.</v>

1284
00:57:21.751 --> 00:57:23.970
<v Speaker 2>This white woman complete lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complete fabrication.</v>

1285
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Who was there trump champion this myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

1286
00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:29.130
<v Speaker 2>But Donald Trump was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst offenders in this,</v>

1287
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>central park five rape case.</v>

1288
00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.123
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got barack obama is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>american who was championing Donald </v>

1289
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump was hugely proud of that.</v>

1290
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.760
<v Speaker 2>And now you've got the muslim band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got charlottesville,</v>

1291
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you've got all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it as very racist.</v>

1292
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And he just raises historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly personally listened.</v>

1293
00:57:49.711 --> 00:57:50.544
<v Speaker 2>I'll be surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Theresa May has tried to clothe </v>

1294
00:57:54.811 --> 00:57:56.720
<v Speaker 2>herself and being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1295
00:57:56.721 --> 00:57:58.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when she was home secretary,</v>

1296
00:57:58.231 --> 00:57:59.160
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1297
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.190
<v Speaker 2>the police stop and search.</v>

1298
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.053
<v Speaker 2>She ordered a review into stop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>search and just the other day she had </v>

1299
00:58:05.611 --> 00:58:09.030
<v Speaker 2>all the race antiracist campaigners in </v>
<v Speaker 2>her office around this.</v>

1300
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look,</v>

1301
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.133
<v Speaker 2>talk about racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's tell you the stats that I could </v>

1302
00:58:12.291 --> 00:58:14.190
<v Speaker 2>have told you the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

1303
00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:16.680
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a big parade about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad the countries.</v>

1304
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.830
<v Speaker 2>He likes to pretend that she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's good on race,</v>

1305
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.753
<v Speaker 2>but she's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's as home secretary and if </v>

1306
00:58:24.091 --> 00:58:24.924
<v Speaker 2>you look at the policy around migration </v>
<v Speaker 2>visas for people from african countries </v>

1307
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.680
<v Speaker 2>denying people enter into the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting.</v>

1308
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:32.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she literally had a policy that said </v>

1309
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:34.523
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to send boats into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediterranean to save brown and black </v>

1310
00:58:36.751 --> 00:58:40.170
<v Speaker 2>people were just going to let them drain</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deter other people from coming.</v>

1311
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dead negro policy.</v>

1312
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:43.440
<v Speaker 2>It's what she's basically saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1313
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at government policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what she's done.</v>

1314
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.293
<v Speaker 2>She's terrible and race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she presents herself as being </v>

1315
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.430
<v Speaker 2>someone you can talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone you can relate to.</v>

1316
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the northern route,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more dangerous,</v>

1317
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:56.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:58:56.791 --> 00:58:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel that that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that,</v>

1319
00:58:59.281 --> 00:59:02.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a slogan that stop over racism,</v>

1320
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:07.370
<v Speaker 1>overt racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overt racism,</v>

1321
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:13.610
<v Speaker 1>overt racism out of football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been mapping my subtle racism now,</v>

1322
00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're covert structural stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's crafty racism.</v>

1323
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the donald argument,</v>

1324
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

1325
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:29.200
<v Speaker 1>is it not an easy argument for a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>person or an english person to make?</v>

1326
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 1>And I'm both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only one of them.</v>

1327
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:32.920
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1328
00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.920
<v Speaker 1>is this something to be said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1329
00:59:34.921 --> 00:59:35.481
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1330
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:36.314
<v Speaker 1>the grotesque amplification at the trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the seven wolf argument that </v>

1331
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:43.394
<v Speaker 1>there was something beneficial in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an honor ignorable hideous </v>

1332
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.700
<v Speaker 1>carbuncle mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1333
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 1>We're now confronted with what our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society means.</v>

1334
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Whereas as long as you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

1335
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:55.094
<v Speaker 1>there was a different kind of violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>immeshed in barack obama in the </v>

1336
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>concealment and the apparent book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1337
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.990
<v Speaker 1>we've got a black president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1338
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:03.183
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there is something </v>

1339
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>depending on where it leads to almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not positive,</v>

1340
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>cathartic about.</v>

1341
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it might sound controversial,</v>

1342
01:00:12.091 --> 01:00:14.640
<v Speaker 2>but I'd rather have Donald Trump as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president than barack obama.</v>

1343
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.691
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1344
01:00:15.691 --> 01:00:18.090
<v Speaker 2>really in terms of racial issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just clear,</v>

1345
01:00:18.091 --> 01:00:18.924
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious is it tells you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to know about this </v>

1346
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:24.600
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas a bomb was fronting is making it</v>

1347
01:00:24.601 --> 01:00:25.740
<v Speaker 2>seem like it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1348
01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>And so if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1349
01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.770
<v Speaker 2>the protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the movements,</v>

1350
01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:29.604
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get angry about things that's </v>

1351
01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:32.700
<v Speaker 2>there now in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't necessarily the,</v>

1352
01:00:32.701 --> 01:00:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he wasn't there completely</v>

1353
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.270
<v Speaker 2>in black lives matter emerges under </v>
<v Speaker 2>obama,</v>

1354
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>partly becaUse I think people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1355
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.350
<v Speaker 2>we've got a black president in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't we expect a bit more?</v>

1356
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.243
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you look now who look at </v>

1357
01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:44.910
<v Speaker 2>definitely the rhetoric around America </v>
<v Speaker 2>is racist.</v>

1358
01:00:44.911 --> 01:00:45.990
<v Speaker 2>This is problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it at a.</v>

1359
01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I think you've seen that comeback more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we need.</v>

1360
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the starting point for the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of politics that we need.</v>

1361
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:51.803
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump,</v>

1362
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>hero of african american.</v>

1363
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.833
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>

1364
01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I won't go that far but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1365
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:01.443
<v Speaker 2>bad precedent for hours I always say at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it on record with Donald Trump </v>

1366
01:01:03.391 --> 01:01:05.580
<v Speaker 2>is the president of black America than </v>
<v Speaker 2>barack obama.</v>

1367
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:06.763
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool because like the thing that </v>

1368
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>seemed sort of where that appeals to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>

1369
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:11.804
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is obviously a personal thing </v>

1370
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a cultural thing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I don't like bullshit.</v>

1371
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the feeling that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually dealing with the problem.</v>

1372
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.693
<v Speaker 1>It's always made me feel uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's made me want to tip over </v>

1373
01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>tables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made me want to be explosive and to</v>

1374
01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of release a kind of romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>volatility into the atmosphere because I</v>

1375
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:33.344
<v Speaker 1>feel like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't real and it's something that </v>

1376
01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>was a person or it comes from a personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1377
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps there isn't no distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between personal,</v>

1378
01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:39.464
<v Speaker 1>political experiences on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt as a kid there's something ain't </v>

1379
01:01:42.081 --> 01:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>right and at score for this isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that filled that truth is not being</v>

1380
01:01:46.101 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>conveyed on a very sort of practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1381
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.053
<v Speaker 1>What will that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was at school feeling like I </v>

1382
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>don't feel like this is a beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that I'm having.</v>

1383
01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd like an interest in my little belly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like I would at least like,</v>

1384
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:00.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I sort of like,</v>

1385
01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1386
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>these geezers and also in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as the president now,</v>

1387
01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:04.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1388
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See now pro power isn't pretending to be</v>

1389
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>your friend anymore and I don't see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1390
01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>the only sense of attachment or </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection or ajit,</v>

1391
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>ajit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1392
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affection.</v>

1393
01:02:14.661 --> 01:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyone could have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump will be like,</v>

1394
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.023
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks like how I feel kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel angry and I don't like life and </v>

1395
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>he looks like that feeling as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1396
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:25.134
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can't imagine how anyone could </v>

1397
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:26.964
<v Speaker 1>have any real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate sense of allegiance that you </v>

1398
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:29.441
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1399
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>what do you feel like with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>charlottesville?</v>

1400
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1401
01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you don't feel like it's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1402
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes when I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1403
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:36.834
<v Speaker 1>when like white people are marching </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with tiki torches in </v>

1404
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:39.564
<v Speaker 1>charlottesville or wherever it's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>statue or something that seems to sort </v>

1405
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.173
<v Speaker 1>of really sort of know necessarily in </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally abstract in fact that is </v>

1406
01:02:45.031 --> 01:02:45.864
<v Speaker 1>dealing with a symbol a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your life will not get better if </v>

1407
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:50.484
<v Speaker 1>you pursue your argument to it's natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion of repatriation or wherever </v>

1408
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>easily into your personal life will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>

1409
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.193
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not consider that to be part of </v>

1410
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the argument that is required by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>say black community?</v>

1411
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you see it much more focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating solidarity?</v>

1412
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1413
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Well no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the,</v>

1414
01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Speaker 2>the counter argument to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the whiteness stuff,</v>

1415
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.523
<v Speaker 2>unless you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a chunk of the people in </v>

1416
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:16.374
<v Speaker 2>charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of the people who voted for </v>

1417
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people,</v>

1418
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 2>they're not really getting anything out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of voting for Donald Trump to get rid of</v>

1419
01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:23.484
<v Speaker 2>your healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever made these crazy decisions all </v>

1420
01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the time to actually vulgar with things </v>
<v Speaker 2>which make their situation worse,</v>

1421
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:30.023
<v Speaker 2>much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1422
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 2>And I guess that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterargument to this whiteness thing.</v>

1423
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 2>If you could tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1424
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>if they could understand these and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would actually,</v>

1425
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:39.380
<v Speaker 2>their interests will be better served </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the big.</v>

1426
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people with everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1427
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.830
<v Speaker 2>With a different kind of politics are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1428
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.843
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I've felt for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while is that the way that power </v>

1429
01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:46.964
<v Speaker 1>operates is there must be a strata of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in institutions for whom the way </v>

1430
01:03:50.751 --> 01:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>that systems operate are not problematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1431
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>for whom the systems are functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

1432
01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a struggle going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1433
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.280
<v Speaker 1>there is no problem because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

1434
01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.500
<v Speaker 1>This is doing what it's meant to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>

1435
01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of think,</v>

1436
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:01.551
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1437
01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:02.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another one that's a </v>

1438
01:04:03.321 --> 01:04:04.154
<v Speaker 1>privileged elite that whether it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone like me this from an </v>

1439
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:08.000
<v Speaker 1>entertainment background that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1440
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm greg over.</v>

1441
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:10.243
<v Speaker 1>I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want as long as I don't rock the boat </v>

1442
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>as I found out when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree.</v>

1443
01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.293
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1444
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.373
<v Speaker 1>and then beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just various degrees of fucked </v>

1445
01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:21.140
<v Speaker 1>going down and down and down to you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got nothing,</v>

1446
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it isn't part of the problem that</v>

1447
01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:26.600
<v Speaker 1>people that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult that once your,</v>

1448
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:27.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of us in our way and now included </v>

1449
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>in culture in a way like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty good.</v>

1450
01:04:32.721 --> 01:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>We've got status power so that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

1451
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:36.744
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see him as batman and find it </v>

1452
01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1453
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.580
<v Speaker 1>What was that thing you said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>

1454
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>

1455
01:04:44.121 --> 01:04:44.954
<v Speaker 1>yet?</v>

1456
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is.</v>

1457
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:48.384
<v Speaker 2>This is part of the pump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also it's really important to </v>

1458
01:04:50.381 --> 01:04:51.214
<v Speaker 2>think about when you say it as those </v>
<v Speaker 2>layers of people who it's not a problem </v>

1459
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:54.883
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would extend that to more people than </v>

1460
01:04:57.041 --> 01:04:58.750
<v Speaker 2>probably most people would extend that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1461
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1462
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:01.803
<v Speaker 2>Even the poorest person in this country </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't deal with child death really on </v>

1463
01:05:04.361 --> 01:05:05.171
<v Speaker 2>a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

1464
01:05:05.171 --> 01:05:06.004
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have those exclusions and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they may have problems and they may be </v>

1465
01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.154
<v Speaker 2>huge problems of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with the politics that we're </v>

1466
01:05:12.131 --> 01:05:12.964
<v Speaker 2>mobilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we just trying to make it a bit </v>

1467
01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:15.274
<v Speaker 2>better for people here or are we trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it better for everybody and I </v>

1468
01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>think there is a consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could come to say,</v>

1469
01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a bit of rich little bit pulled</v>

1470
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:21.903
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will equal arabic and everybody will be </v>

1471
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:24.274
<v Speaker 2>perfectly happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't solve the problem for </v>

1472
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>child death in public yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1473
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1474
01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And I must be taught to care hindi </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1475
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.200
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1476
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>that argument can be made from the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to demotivate people.</v>

1477
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that even the poorest people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

1478
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:39.814
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you're not dealing with some </v>

1479
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>bad kid in a mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1480
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I need more say steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

1481
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think being an educator,</v>

1482
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>what do you think are the obligations </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1483
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their perspective of education?</v>

1484
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:53.614
<v Speaker 1>What should we be being taught the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of colonialism and imperialism </v>

1485
01:05:56.771 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 1>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What impact would that have?</v>

1486
01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.091
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1487
01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

1488
01:06:00.231 --> 01:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>what is the reality like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

1489
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean you think about empire and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about we,</v>

1490
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.463
<v Speaker 2>the people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't judge people for what they </v>

1491
01:06:06.771 --> 01:06:08.740
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately we don't know.</v>

1492
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:11.510
<v Speaker 2>That system is terrible at telling us </v>
<v Speaker 2>things which are really important.</v>

1493
01:06:11.511 --> 01:06:14.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think teaching about empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just teach just that if you just say,</v>

1494
01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:15.323
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's teach an honest account of where </v>

1495
01:06:16.201 --> 01:06:17.034
<v Speaker 2>did britain gates will from where it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain sustain his wealth to date and </v>

1496
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:23.360
<v Speaker 2>understand how the global system works </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how the global system privileges us.</v>

1497
01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I think if you could just eat that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be a starting point,</v>

1498
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>but then it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a bit more than that.</v>

1499
01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the black studies degree,</v>

1500
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we started,</v>

1501
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.500
<v Speaker 2>we have these arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we put them into practice.</v>

1502
01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1503
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to mobilize?</v>

1504
01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:38.030
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean to how you act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community?</v>

1505
01:06:38.031 --> 01:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>How do you as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an academic,</v>

1506
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I can just be an academic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be an activist.</v>

1507
01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.490
<v Speaker 2>They have to be a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1508
01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:44.563
<v Speaker 2>have to be building these organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing this work and really teaching </v>

1509
01:06:46.941 --> 01:06:49.280
<v Speaker 2>people that they have a responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make this better.</v>

1510
01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>The he kind of is a comment on us with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the privilege to make things better.</v>

1511
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:54.283
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important as well.</v>

1512
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.343
<v Speaker 1>Both of those things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first part it seems like I can </v>

1513
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>imagine that feeling like a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heresy,</v>

1514
01:06:59.110 --> 01:06:59.943
<v Speaker 1>which makes me recognize again how </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary the distinction between what </v>

1515
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:04.324
<v Speaker 1>you call one course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious and what one calls the </v>

1516
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:06.994
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that line is arbitrary because if </v>

1517
01:07:08.351 --> 01:07:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you are in a school guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1518
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.270
<v Speaker 1>This is what british empire is with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice in depth analysis in africa.</v>

1519
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.183
<v Speaker 1>We've done that in Ireland and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome you can have your coco pops </v>

1520
01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>enjoy lunch and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1521
01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to ruin everyone's morale.</v>

1522
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's sports day tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1523
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with that black studies course,</v>

1524
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>how's it going and how many people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and is it all black people?</v>

1525
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's going,</v>

1526
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:35.350
<v Speaker 2>well first year we've got about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

1527
01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>which is what we expected to get without</v>
<v Speaker 2>a target to get a.</v>

1528
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 2>It is actually usable by people for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

1529
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>african american studies is lies.</v>

1530
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Lots of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asian people.</v>

1531
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.460
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the stuff?</v>

1532
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about that woman that felt like she</v>

1533
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:53.690
<v Speaker 2>was black in that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember that story?</v>

1534
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Which one is an idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like I'm black actually.</v>

1535
01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>So like what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did we go with that?</v>

1536
01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:02.653
<v Speaker 2>Is that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was a duke university didn't </v>

1537
01:08:05.571 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 2>mind it may or something and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving a talk about blackness,</v>

1538
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:08.794
<v Speaker 2>citrus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>citrus and african american studies </v>

1539
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:12.430
<v Speaker 2>department and somebody turned around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1540
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:13.264
<v Speaker 2>well actually the way you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about blackness being this political </v>

1541
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>concept stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it true?</v>

1542
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that mean rachel dolezal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>black?</v>

1543
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:20.803
<v Speaker 2>And I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I couldn't believe it because </v>

1544
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>african american studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it had been a bit more nuance</v>

1545
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not really covered the basics,</v>

1546
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:37.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think if somebody like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're taking.</v>

1547
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1548
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:39.720
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my argument is that right,</v>

1549
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.963
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1550
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>color of my skin is important because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of it in work it tells about</v>

1551
01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 2>me and what it tells me about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections into.</v>

1552
01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Then you quite just faked it like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys make that up life.</v>

1553
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:49.603
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that unites you </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically then to try to pretend to </v>

1554
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Speaker 2>complete not only destroyed any concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>of unity sense,</v>

1555
01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:00.230
<v Speaker 2>so it's utterly offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't ever get really mad about</v>

1556
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:01.790
<v Speaker 2>this because you probably just got </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health problems.</v>

1557
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:02.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real level.</v>

1558
01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 2>I wanting to be black later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really want to be black.</v>

1559
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:05.804
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes a particular distorted view </v>

1560
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.920
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

1561
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I liked the music in the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so keen on the slavery.</v>

1562
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1563
01:09:14.381 --> 01:09:15.214
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics can become very divisive in as </v>

1564
01:09:19.061 --> 01:09:19.894
<v Speaker 1>well as creating great cohesion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum and this is a moment I feel </v>

1565
01:09:24.821 --> 01:09:28.420
<v Speaker 1>around these kinds of ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose as a white male,</v>

1566
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm uniquely qualified to pontificate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>all facets of that guy and that was an </v>

1567
01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>amazing interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

1568
01:09:37.031 --> 01:09:41.200
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel properly like educated on a broad</v>

1569
01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:42.034
<v Speaker 1>area of topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus we got stuck in with some real </v>

1570
01:09:44.261 --> 01:09:45.094
<v Speaker 1>populism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think notably the moment of Donald </v>

1571
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Trump is a bad precedent for black </v>
<v Speaker 1>american and barack obama.</v>

1572
01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That some radicalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1573
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully people will put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People's.</v>

1574
01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:54.774
<v Speaker 2>Mothers will put a picture of donald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump won the war after I said </v>

1575
01:09:56.851 --> 01:09:57.684
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what your mom cried when Donald </v>

1576
01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Trump becomes president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to cry with.</v>

1577
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:01.143
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this.</v>
