2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.003
<v Speaker 1>Originally from Swaziland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spent a number of years living with </v>

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.064
<v Speaker 1>migrant workers in South Africa studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of exploitation and political </v>

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>resistance in the wake of apartheid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alongside is ethnographic work.</v>

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.843
<v Speaker 1>He writes about development inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and global political economy for the </v>

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Guardian and other online outlets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His new book,</v>

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.763
<v Speaker 1>the divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brief guide to global inequality and </v>

8
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>it solutions is out now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>welcome to under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me.</v>

10
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it an honor to have you on?</v>

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>You're actually a doctor.</v>

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not the kind of,</v>

13
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 2>it can save your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly.</v>

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:44.554
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could talk about medicine and all </v>

16
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:46.504
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm much more interested in talking </v>

17
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.883
<v Speaker 1>global inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought one things after sort of like </v>

19
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>recently having had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.663
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore on the show for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talking about huge issue like </v>

21
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

22
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I feel to listen to the framework within</v>
<v Speaker 1>which these conversations,</v>

23
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>particularly conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant change at,</v>

24
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>they take place within a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable framework.</v>

25
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.013
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could talk to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us a bit of an overview of global </v>

26
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how things stand economically,</v>

28
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>how we got into this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll crack on from there.</v>

29
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the place to start is what do </v>

30
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.444
<v Speaker 2>we presently think about global </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality and what's kind of happening </v>

31
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 2>in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

32
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.673
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a dominant narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that comes out of the World </v>

33
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.763
<v Speaker 2>Bank predominantly and gets repeated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media quite often that global </v>

34
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 2>inequality on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

35
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 2>a global scale is actually diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with globalization.</v>

36
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.663
<v Speaker 2>So we know for a fact that globalization</v>
<v Speaker 2>has caused inequality rates within </v>

37
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 2>countries to get worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the arguments from the World Bank is</v>

38
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 2>that on a global scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting better.</v>

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So the media picks us up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

40
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happened most recently,</v>

41
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and argues that,</v>

42
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.484
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globalization is actually good for the </v>

43
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 2>poor of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's working.</v>

45
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 2>We should keep doing it because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral thing to do.</v>

46
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>So what's interesting is if you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind those statistics,</v>

47
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 2>you find that there are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>misleading because a,</v>

48
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 2>they think about global inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if everybody in the world is part of </v>

50
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 2>the same big country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

51
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And so on that basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does appear that global inequality is</v>

52
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:29.724
<v Speaker 2>diminishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only if you include China and East </v>

53
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

54
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

55
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the only part of the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has not been forcibly globalized,</v>

56
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.913
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Washington consensus under US </v>

57
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>pressure since the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They basically,</v>

58
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.033
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transform their economies according to </v>

59
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.044
<v Speaker 2>their own standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't really work to have the </v>

60
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>narrative work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

61
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 2>and here's the crucial point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at global inequality between</v>

62
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:52.914
<v Speaker 2>regions of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between say the global north and the </v>

63
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 2>global south or rich countries versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor countries,</v>

64
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>what we see is that rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing global inequality is getting</v>

65
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.530
<v Speaker 2>dramatically worse since the 1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.433
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the per capita income gap between the </v>

67
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>north and the south rich countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor countries has tripled in size.</v>

68
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really a dramatic,</v>

69
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dramatic condemnation of,</v>

70
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of globalization and pointing out that </v>

71
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>it's just not working for the vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of humanity.</v>

72
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of,</v>

73
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>of the yields of global capitalism are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to rich countries.</v>

74
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a big problem.</v>

75
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.243
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in a way it would be obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>that globalization would increase </v>

76
00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:32.174
<v Speaker 1>inequality is globalization is a term </v>
<v Speaker 1>which really covers the power of </v>

77
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:43.451
<v Speaker 1>transnational corporations to have one </v>
<v Speaker 1>market place regulate it in a way that's</v>

78
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:45.974
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of makes sense that that </v>

79
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.094
<v Speaker 1>would mean that money was traveling in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular direction and it wouldn't be </v>

80
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:54.680
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to the poorest and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable people.</v>

81
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are these myths sustained,</v>

82
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Jason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ideas like,</v>

83
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.893
<v Speaker 1>like trickle down economics and mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>production that the ultimately all in </v>

84
00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

85
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>how often have nearly a century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.693
<v Speaker 1>or these kind of ideas sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it kind of a form of propaganda and </v>

87
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>the management it's the same stakes as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already mentioned?</v>

88
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

89
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.433
<v Speaker 2>first I just want to briefly touch on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you mentioned just now with </v>

90
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 2>trickled down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at,</v>

91
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all of the new income generated by </v>

92
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.830
<v Speaker 2>global GDP growth over the past couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of decades,</v>

93
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.873
<v Speaker 2>GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gross domestic products basically </v>

94
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 2>measured as the s the increasing size of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the global economy.</v>

95
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 5% of all new income generated by </v>

96
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 2>global growth has gone to the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 2>60% of humanity.</v>

97
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's an extremely slow rate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trickle down.</v>

98
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 1>It's barely trickling down at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't even get there.</v>

100
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a vapor by the time it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>halfway down.</v>

101
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.723
<v Speaker 2>And economists have pointed out that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rate of trickle down to eradicate </v>

103
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:53.864
<v Speaker 2>poverty from the face of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we technically </v>

104
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 2>theoretically want to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a would take over 200 years.</v>

105
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 2>That's how slow it trickles down.</v>

106
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>If there was any intention to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicate poverty,</v>

107
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>this is not the means by which she would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

108
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:05.524
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 2>That is definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

110
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the argument that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>make in my book,</v>

111
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 2>the divide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the reason to have intention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicate poverty,</v>

113
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>hobbies necessary is in it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>global economic model.</v>

114
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

115
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you're an anthropologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't ever,</v>

116
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 1>apologies means study if she human </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

117
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.861
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

118
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's anthropology.</v>

119
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>

120
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:27.424
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my anthropological work is focused on a </v>

121
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>particular part of the world that South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

122
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm originally from Swaziland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite close to where I'm from.</v>

123
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.293
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at patterns of migration and </v>

124
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>exploitation in that region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

125
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.423
<v Speaker 2>but just I guess just by virtue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having grown up in Swaziland and then </v>

126
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>moving to the states from a university </v>
<v Speaker 2>and phd,</v>

127
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.101
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:45.934
<v Speaker 2>I was really grappling with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of why are some countries so </v>

129
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:49.144
<v Speaker 2>immensely rich and consume so much while</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries are so miserably poor </v>

130
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 2>and have been for such a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

131
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.234
<v Speaker 2>so I guess that's the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of why the is divided as it is </v>

132
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:58.964
<v Speaker 2>economically as really exercise me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of led me on this really </v>

133
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.414
<v Speaker 2>10 or more your journey to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand more about how the global </v>

134
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 2>economy works and write that up in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the average person can understand.</v>

135
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.263
<v Speaker 1>So the aspect of anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interests you is the movement of </v>

136
00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.970
<v Speaker 1>resources and capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And systems of dominance.</v>

137
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And after your decade of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading to this book of yours,</v>

138
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:19.524
<v Speaker 1>the divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your most important </v>

139
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.430
<v Speaker 1>observations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

140
00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:24.264
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you said in a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anyone can understand cause I'm </v>

141
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.320
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you put it in a,</v>

142
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>tell us what your most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>observations are?</v>

143
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.783
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to go back to the question </v>

144
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 2>that you asked earlier about it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

145
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ultimately answer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question you just asked right now.</v>

146
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned this thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

147
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

148
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>what's the narrative that sort of keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system chugging along?</v>

149
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And it was a brilliant question </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

150
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that probably,</v>

151
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the center of this narrative is that,</v>

153
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.053
<v Speaker 2>rich countries have become rich based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own hard work and they have the </v>

155
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Speaker 2>right policies and there's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

156
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas poor countries or poor because,</v>

157
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>they have internal policy failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're corrupt me that maybe they</v>

159
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.180
<v Speaker 2>have bad climates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough resources,</v>

160
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:05.014
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

161
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rich countries a very generous and </v>

162
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:08.464
<v Speaker 2>what they do is they give generously of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their surplus across the divide to poor </v>

163
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:14.410
<v Speaker 2>countries to help them sort of a up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development ladder.</v>

164
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>And so we hear this all the time from </v>
<v Speaker 2>our politicians talking about the,</v>

165
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the international aid budget,</v>

166
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 2>the foreign aid budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on a global scale,</v>

167
00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:22.384
<v Speaker 2>the foreign aid budget that flows from </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich countries to poor countries is </v>

168
00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's $130 billion per year right now.</v>

169
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:29.470
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is,</v>

170
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.513
<v Speaker 2>that's about the a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equivalent of all of the profits of </v>

171
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 2>all of the commercial banks in the u s </v>
<v Speaker 2>combines,</v>

172
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

173
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 2>that goes from north to south every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

174
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

175
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.080
<v Speaker 2>if you look at all the money that flows </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world,</v>

176
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>way more flows from south to north on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>order of magnitude,</v>

177
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.090
<v Speaker 2>then trickles the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is really the,</v>

178
00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key point that we need to make here.</v>

179
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>The aid is not flowing from north to </v>
<v Speaker 2>south.</v>

180
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.170
<v Speaker 2>It's flowing from south to north.</v>

181
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.183
<v Speaker 2>It's flowing in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically poor countries are </v>

182
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:56.794
<v Speaker 2>developing rich countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich countries are not developing for </v>

183
00:07:58.541 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>our countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they're the,</v>

184
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that flows from north to South East</v>

185
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:03.784
<v Speaker 2>contextualized his aid and that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>flows from south to north is content's </v>

186
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 2>job contextualized as good business is </v>
<v Speaker 2>economics.</v>

187
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 2>But really you would taste sort of post </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonial exploitation.</v>

188
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it as,</v>

189
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 2>as plunder or you can see it as tributes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

190
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.090
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a really important fact.</v>

191
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:20.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually quite recent data.</v>

192
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess it was a December or January,</v>

193
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.993
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an an institute in Washington DC called </v>

194
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:27.154
<v Speaker 2>global financial integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partnered with the Norwegian School of </v>

195
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.873
<v Speaker 2>economics to do the most comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>study of financial flows around the </v>

196
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 2>world ever conducted in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.493
<v Speaker 2>in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they've found is that poor </v>

198
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 2>countries are net creditors to rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

199
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.313
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

201
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.183
<v Speaker 2>on such a scale that for every dollar of</v>
<v Speaker 2>aid that port can receive from which </v>

202
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.820
<v Speaker 2>they lose $24 in net outflows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

204
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basically the south is effectively </v>

205
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.063
<v Speaker 2>hemorrhaging to the north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this happens through all sorts of </v>

206
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.044
<v Speaker 2>flows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

207
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>illicit financial flows that basically </v>

208
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.104
<v Speaker 2>corporations stealing money out of poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and s and storing them in tax </v>

209
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:04.630
<v Speaker 2>havens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

210
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>many of which are controlled by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

211
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say stealing money,</v>

212
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by what means?</v>

213
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

214
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.070
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a mechanism called,</v>

215
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called trade miss invoicing.</v>

216
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.650
<v Speaker 2>And basically the way this works is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a company will,</v>

217
00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:18.484
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll falsify it's trade invoices when </v>

218
00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:23.140
<v Speaker 2>it's exporting goods out of a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>country into a rich country.</v>

219
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

220
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can actually end up taking,</v>

221
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking money offshore,</v>

222
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.090
<v Speaker 2>putting in a tax haven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult for customers to</v>

223
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:32.260
<v Speaker 2>stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

224
00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a practice that's been legalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically by the WTO since 1994.</v>

225
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

226
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:38.284
<v Speaker 2>and the WTO of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is controlled largely by rich countries </v>

227
00:09:39.941 --> 00:09:40.774
<v Speaker 2>since they have the bargaining power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were able to sort of establish </v>

228
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:42.934
<v Speaker 2>this rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is deeply detrimental to poor </v>

229
00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:45.124
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

230
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but he's like apparently neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>governing and regulate.</v>

231
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:48.924
<v Speaker 1>We bodies are in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way the administrative henchman of </v>

232
00:09:53.771 --> 00:09:54.604
<v Speaker 1>a system of globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on exploitation of poor </v>

233
00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

234
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way to put it.</v>

235
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I should write that in my next book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cancer.</v>

236
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

237
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at,</v>

238
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 2>if you look at just illicit financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>flows alone,</v>

239
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's over 1 trillion US dollars </v>

240
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 2>that flows from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from poor to rich every year,</v>

241
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which outstrips the aid budget itself by</v>

242
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:17.214
<v Speaker 2>a factor of 10 a right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's all sorts of all sorts of </v>

243
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 2>other flows like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

244
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 2>like the interest payments on foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>loans that port companies have to pay,</v>

245
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profit repatriation from multinational </v>

246
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:27.950
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.853
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

248
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I suppose part of your point then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

249
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.703
<v Speaker 1>is that many of the systems that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider to be sort of objective and </v>

250
00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:41.290
<v Speaker 1>just are kind of administrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>fictions,</v>

251
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the economy itself and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a GDP,</v>

252
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not earn an objective reality.</v>

253
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of what you're saying mate?</v>

254
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

255
00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.040
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

256
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>and I'll definitely want to talk a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more about GDP and how that is a fiction</v>

257
00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:00.160
<v Speaker 2>of our imagination that's become quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive.</v>

258
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

259
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.073
<v Speaker 2>but just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to go back to what you were saying </v>

260
00:11:03.011 --> 00:11:03.844
<v Speaker 2>earlier about these admin administrative</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies who Ronnie sketch sharing a </v>

261
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.740
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

262
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.253
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned these global </v>

263
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 2>administrative bodies and it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the WTO,</v>

264
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:15.640
<v Speaker 2>it's also like the World Bank and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>IMF.</v>

265
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.803
<v Speaker 2>So look at Netherlands,</v>

266
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>those acronyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acronyms.</v>

267
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I've always fought IMF wb out of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever I see stuff happening near</v>

268
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.640
<v Speaker 1>dodgy.</v>

269
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are definitely dodged.</v>

270
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And here's the deal is that the World </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bank,</v>

271
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.413
<v Speaker 2>the international monetary funds are a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are basically the institutions that </v>

272
00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 2>control the rules of the global economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

273
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:36.124
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're profoundly anti democratic </v>

274
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:39.460
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So rich countries,</v>

275
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.830
<v Speaker 2>which have a minority of the population </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

276
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.943
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half about 50% of the vote in these </v>

277
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:44.884
<v Speaker 2>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s government has a veto over all </v>

278
00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:48.880
<v Speaker 2>major decisions made in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>

279
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.400
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing's pointless anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

280
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's deeply,</v>

281
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:55.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a deeply compromised system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

282
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.590
<v Speaker 2>the problem is primarily that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-democratic.</v>

284
00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.810
<v Speaker 2>If you were to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

285
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>open up the WTO and World Bank and </v>
<v Speaker 2>International Monetary Fund.</v>

287
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.983
<v Speaker 2>See real democratic practice doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give poor countries a fair voice in how </v>

288
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 2>the global economy is run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely we would see dramatic change.</v>

289
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell oven buggering about with it.</v>

290
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.791
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

291
00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:18.090
<v Speaker 1>so that'd be a o Imf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things I keep,</v>

292
00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm listing boxing organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>now called the mcgregor fight,</v>

293
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.780
<v Speaker 1>fill it bay where I say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

294
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.423
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us some more of those statistics </v>

295
00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:32.190
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of a mind boggling like,</v>

296
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:35.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how can we,</v>

297
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.833
<v Speaker 1>how can a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ongoing narrative and narrative be </v>

298
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:44.331
<v Speaker 1>the depletion of poverty when you EGA </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people are living on less than a</v>

299
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.353
<v Speaker 1>dollar a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one that saw voice clumps me in </v>

300
00:12:47.071 --> 00:12:47.904
<v Speaker 1>the face when I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest eight people in the world </v>

301
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:53.780
<v Speaker 1>control the same amount of wealth is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorest half of the world's fault.</v>

302
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a killer facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

303
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to go to the poverty number </v>

304
00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:00.560
<v Speaker 2>that you just mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

305
00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:02.060
<v Speaker 2>and that sounds about Nicole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

306
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a system now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

307
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

308
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.740
<v Speaker 2>the World Bank and the UN are telling us</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

309
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of poor people in the world </v>

310
00:13:11.601 --> 00:13:15.980
<v Speaker 2>is between 700 million and 1 billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>people basically right now.</v>

311
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.163
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they've been saying is that </v>

312
00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that number has been decreasing over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past 15 or so years.</v>

313
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of their,</v>

314
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.490
<v Speaker 2>the way the good things that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically through aid and so on.</v>

315
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at how they measure </v>

316
00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:28.964
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

318
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.590
<v Speaker 2>that that number comes from a poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

319
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a dollar 25 per day right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

320
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.383
<v Speaker 2>scholars from all over the world have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been pointing out that nobody can live </v>

321
00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 2>on a dollar 25 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally ludicrous,</v>

322
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 2>immoral number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

323
00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:50.180
<v Speaker 2>so in order to achieve the most basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of human subsistence,</v>

324
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to achieve normal human life expectancy,</v>

325
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a decent chance of surviving </v>

326
00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:55.410
<v Speaker 2>pastor fifth birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

327
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have at least $5 per day,</v>

328
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As like a moral minimum.</v>

329
00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:01.160
<v Speaker 2>They called us the ethical poverty line.</v>

330
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Let me just get below that moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum.</v>

331
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing.</v>

332
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.423
<v Speaker 2>If you measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you measure global poverty at that </v>

333
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:09.584
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not 1 billion people in </v>

334
00:14:11.571 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 4.3</v>

335
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:13.904
<v Speaker 2>billion people in poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 60% of the world's population </v>

336
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.460
<v Speaker 2>and the number has been getting bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>

337
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.050
<v Speaker 2>not getting smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

338
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:23.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that the narrative that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

339
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.730
<v Speaker 2>that comes out of some of these bodies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't worry,</v>

340
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:29.210
<v Speaker 2>poverty is a diminishing and equalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing is just not true.</v>

341
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.430
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the scholarship </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>

342
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.490
<v Speaker 2>we see exactly the opposite story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we really have to ask ourselves,</v>

343
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.220
<v Speaker 2>why is the global economy is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally flawed?</v>

344
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.710
<v Speaker 2>This to fix this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it fair,</v>

345
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to require more than just </v>

346
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:44.210
<v Speaker 2>tweaking around the edges of the bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aid here and there,</v>

347
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather fundamentally reorganizing </v>

348
00:14:46.521 --> 00:14:47.354
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>

349
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.763
<v Speaker 1>How on Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will you fundamentally reorganized </v>

350
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.943
<v Speaker 1>system when the system is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to the people that control </v>

351
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:56.234
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

352
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

353
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.553
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

354
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can think about it this way,</v>

355
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of is this possible or not?</v>

356
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have lots of students,</v>

357
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my students come in like,</v>

358
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply concerned about poverty and </v>

359
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:11.860
<v Speaker 2>inequality and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

360
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.290
<v Speaker 2>and they get really interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

361
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in solutions like,</v>

362
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro finance or foreign aid or whatever</v>

363
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 2>it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

364
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that the solutions </v>

365
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:22.544
<v Speaker 2>that they're interested in don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually target the real structural </v>

366
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>causes of the problems that they are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned to address.</v>

367
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.360
<v Speaker 2>If we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can get messages out to,</v>

368
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.203
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these students who fill the </v>

369
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:33.284
<v Speaker 2>development industry and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development organizations that are out </v>

370
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 2>there that are trying to tackle these </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

371
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>that what we need is to tackle these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

372
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 2>the real deep structural drivers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes the problem in the first place.</v>

373
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

374
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.661
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

375
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 2>the problem can be solved relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

376
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.253
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

377
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

378
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned one of the,</v>

379
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the top solutions for me it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

380
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it would be democracy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions of global governance.</v>

381
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

382
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 2>and they're all sorts of proposals out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

383
00:15:58.941 --> 00:15:59.774
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is demand at that global south </v>

384
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 2>countries have been making for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for a fair,</v>

385
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.933
<v Speaker 2>for fair reason.</v>

386
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Cause I never hear those arguments so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're afraid is that been going?</v>

387
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Can we have a bit of democracy in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>world governance organizations?</v>

388
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And that message just never gets it</v>

389
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.180
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never gets tired.</v>

390
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

391
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.091
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting ones.</v>

393
00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

394
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge wage differential between</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers and the global north and workers</v>

395
00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:23.410
<v Speaker 2>in the global south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

396
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.323
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of that is due to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that multinational companies can move </v>

397
00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:29.220
<v Speaker 2>around the world looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheapest possible labor.</v>

398
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.730
<v Speaker 2>The workers can't move across borders as</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely right now,</v>

399
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.163
<v Speaker 2>which is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that workers on </v>

400
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:39.300
<v Speaker 2>the path to try to compete with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other to drive their own wages down.</v>

401
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really been,</v>

402
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.650
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible</v>

403
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Gyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrible,</v>

404
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>this Dystopian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is already living in this type.</v>

405
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.630
<v Speaker 1>We are in the global north luckily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something,</v>

407
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.730
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose a,</v>

408
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:55.564
<v Speaker 2>although it's not totally clear to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we really deserve our privileges </v>

409
00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.584
<v Speaker 2>here</v>

410
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.863
<v Speaker 1>and also we are not part of those eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have got off of everything </v>

411
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>our years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly not.</v>

412
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So like as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deep structural change like that.</v>

413
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was talking to Al Gore who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was absolutely lovely,</v>

414
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people said talking at our golf</v>
<v Speaker 1>around fairly in my view like that.</v>

415
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.510
<v Speaker 1>My main point was how can you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant change within a context that</v>

416
00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:28.680
<v Speaker 1>is designed to prohibit real change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once when Yanis Varoufakis was here,</v>

417
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.200
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that,</v>

418
00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know that wolf gang showers at him </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies.</v>

419
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you don't change anything.</v>

420
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.430
<v Speaker 1>So as you are now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

421
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.010
<v Speaker 1>systemic change is what's required now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the air like?</v>

422
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.110
<v Speaker 1>So what I feel like I want this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is marshal people's attention into</v>

423
00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:47.550
<v Speaker 1>the correct areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going,</v>

424
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice to have some micro,</v>

425
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.453
<v Speaker 1>like your lovely students coming in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>day one and they're big lovely scarves </v>

426
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>and their rosy cheeks or full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimism.</v>

427
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

428
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What ideas should we be pushing?</v>

429
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 1>What should we be campaigning for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nave mentioned democracy at the level of</v>

430
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:04.180
<v Speaker 1>global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

431
00:18:04.181 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>of institutions that glove govern global</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance as one thing.</v>

432
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've remembered that.</v>

433
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.673
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

434
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.670
<v Speaker 2>So in order to really understand what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>at stake here,</v>

435
00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:14.504
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have to understand how a</v>
<v Speaker 2>global inequality came to be as extreme </v>

436
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.270
<v Speaker 2>as it as it is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

437
00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:22.040
<v Speaker 2>So we needed like some of the historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective there.</v>

438
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll handle this one.</v>

439
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.420
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very lazy.</v>

440
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Then there's countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries where we really were </v>

441
00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:32.420
<v Speaker 1>an industrious bunch and we crack shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of things done.</v>

442
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.313
<v Speaker 1>Now is there an alternative version?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the alternative version is that we </v>

443
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.500
<v Speaker 1>might want to start with colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

444
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to look for sort of like</v>

445
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:43.070
<v Speaker 1>the origins of it,</v>

446
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 2>of mass poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

447
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.583
<v Speaker 2>It really is under colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was basically a process of mass </v>

448
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 2>displacement of peasants from the land </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

449
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a total wreckage of a,</v>

450
00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:55.210
<v Speaker 2>of local economies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

451
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>so we know for a fact that during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the colonial period,</v>

452
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most regions,</v>

453
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>income growth,</v>

454
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 2>real income growth per capita was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>only 0.5%</v>

455
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:07.790
<v Speaker 2>per year for the entire colonial period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

456
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a result of colonialism,</v>

457
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich countries like Britain,</v>

458
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to grow at a more than three times </v>

459
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:15.384
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a major driver of </v>

460
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

461
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 2>but here's the interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

462
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.403
<v Speaker 2>and if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go back to colonials and at some </v>

463
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:21.330
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

464
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the wake of colonialism in the </v>

465
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 2>two decades after colonialism ended in </v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

466
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:26.940
<v Speaker 2>in the 1950s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1960s,</v>

467
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 2>there was a complete miracle in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global south.</v>

468
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:31.703
<v Speaker 2>they suddenly had a democracy and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had control over their own economic </v>

470
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did they do?</v>

471
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.903
<v Speaker 2>They elected leftist progressive leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought in tariff protections </v>

472
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 2>to protect their markets from a cheap </v>
<v Speaker 2>goods from abroad.</v>

473
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.250
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

474
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>they nationalized their own resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They nationalized,</v>

475
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of big companies and banks,</v>

476
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.561
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the increased labor standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

478
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:51.794
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they redistributed land from rich land </v>

479
00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 2>owners to peasants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with these policies,</v>

480
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:59.450
<v Speaker 2>they were remarkably successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you mind telling us,</v>

481
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all over the global south,</v>

482
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.040
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it,</v>

483
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I guess most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

484
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 2>most clearly I suppose in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

485
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:06.910
<v Speaker 2>look at what's happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

486
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>in Chile and Brazil and Uruguay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can also see it,</v>

487
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in parts of the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Egypt's in East Asia,</v>

488
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 2>this is very clear as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

489
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.913
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

490
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.790
<v Speaker 1>unshackled from colonialism found its </v>
<v Speaker 1>way towards policies,</v>

491
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.060
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>

492
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.983
<v Speaker 1>redistribution of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>management of trade and I suppose </v>

493
00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Speaker 1>systems that we're focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People rather than profit broad.</v>

494
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.331
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

495
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were using,</v>

496
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.123
<v Speaker 2>and they were using their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their national wealth to invest in </v>

497
00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:37.430
<v Speaker 2>things like education and health care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

498
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:38.810
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

499
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.003
<v Speaker 2>poverty starts diminishing and the gap </v>
<v Speaker 2>between rich countries and poor </v>

500
00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:45.230
<v Speaker 2>countries starts closing for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in history.</v>

501
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It was really a kind of miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think that rich countries,</v>

502
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.840
<v Speaker 2>since I always go on about wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop poor countries,</v>

503
00:20:50.841 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 2>it'll be very excited about this trends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

504
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.861
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

505
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:54.694
<v Speaker 2>there's success and poverty is reducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but quite the opposite actually what we </v>

506
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.160
<v Speaker 2>see is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

507
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.453
<v Speaker 2>rich nations feel that they're losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their access to cheap labor and cheap </v>

508
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.400
<v Speaker 2>raw materials and the global south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

509
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:07.084
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the access they'd enjoyed under </v>

511
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 2>colonialism and so they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervening,</v>

512
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.043
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violently by deposing a lot of these </v>

513
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 2>progressive leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

514
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Speaker 2>So I remember reading all those about </v>
<v Speaker 2>those leaders.</v>

515
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.920
<v Speaker 2>They're a horrible bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

516
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Globalization's just colonization by </v>
<v Speaker 2>another name.</v>

517
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

518
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

519
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.671
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

520
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

521
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

522
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 2>the series of coups that started </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfolding,</v>

523
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>led by Britain and the US and France and</v>

524
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were we doing?</v>

525
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:37.504
<v Speaker 2>We were funding who's very rear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either overthrowing leaders in the </v>

526
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:43.714
<v Speaker 2>global south ourselves or we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding movements to overthrow them or </v>

527
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:47.734
<v Speaker 2>we were just supporting right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships to prevent a democratic </v>

528
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.460
<v Speaker 2>revolutions from happening and the froth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really love it.</v>

529
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get,</v>

530
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in the global north,</v>

531
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 2>so I suppose it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

532
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that that's how they can,</v>

533
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.903
<v Speaker 2>a very short period of time postcolonial</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee economic disparity was decreased </v>

534
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 2>because people obviously acted in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a national self interest,</v>

535
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.540
<v Speaker 2>not this sort of rampant individualism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and inequality producing systems that we</v>

536
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 2>have grown to know and love.</v>

537
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.293
<v Speaker 2>But these are about all of these regions</v>
<v Speaker 2>where pretty much successfully the </v>

538
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 2>stabilized in that that movement was </v>
<v Speaker 2>quashed.</v>

539
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.501
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

540
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 2>the other movement was quashed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't actually by the cous.</v>

541
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Cous cous took a really big tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

542
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:32.763
<v Speaker 2>And the most famous of these is the coup</v>
<v Speaker 2>against Salvador Allende in Chile in </v>

543
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:35.584
<v Speaker 2>1973.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can watch footage of it on </v>

544
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:38.260
<v Speaker 2>youtube actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarrely.</v>

545
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

546
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.413
<v Speaker 2>but so even despite these interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the global south was still rising </v>

547
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Speaker 2>through the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

548
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.701
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

549
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:46.171
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

550
00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:47.004
<v Speaker 2>and the global north in the form of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>g seven literally sat down around </v>

551
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.793
<v Speaker 2>tables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders of the g seven sat there aren't </v>

552
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.650
<v Speaker 2>done round tables to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop this movement.</v>

553
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.190
<v Speaker 2>The movement was called Developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisdom,</v>

554
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

555
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was very successful and,</v>

556
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:01.983
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they couldn't figure out ways to </v>

557
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:03.874
<v Speaker 2>sort of block this because it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming very powerful in the halls of </v>

558
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the UN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a democratic body,</v>

559
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.150
<v Speaker 2>global south countries.</v>

560
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.520
<v Speaker 2>We're winning a new policies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairer for them basically.</v>

561
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

562
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.243
<v Speaker 2>but then in 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tables turned dramatically in a </v>

563
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>single crazy events that changed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global order in one fell swoop.</v>

564
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And that was the third world debt </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

565
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.343
<v Speaker 2>So basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the U S Federal Reserve jacked up </v>

566
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 2>interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

567
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.491
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:34.150
<v Speaker 2>to really high levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20% and global south countries,</v>

569
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.720
<v Speaker 2>we're heavily indebted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

570
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 2>in US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They suddenly were not able to pay their</v>

571
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>debts back because of the interest rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>hike.</v>

572
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And they slid to the brink of default </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

573
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were going to default,</v>

574
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street would have basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed.</v>

575
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And so Wall Street talked to the u s </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and said,</v>

576
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:50.710
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to bail us out.</v>

577
00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.563
<v Speaker 2>You need to solve this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US government talk to the IMF and </v>

578
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.124
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going to go and roll over the </v>

579
00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:58.980
<v Speaker 2>debts of those developing countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

580
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.870
<v Speaker 2>on the condition that they adopt what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>call structural adjustment programs,</v>

581
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 2>which basically means liberalize your </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade,</v>

582
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut your labor rules,</v>

583
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.670
<v Speaker 2>cut your environmental regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

584
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 2>privatized your companies and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>assets,</v>

585
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

586
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.853
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

587
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.243
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naomi Klein's it was about in shock </v>

588
00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:22.601
<v Speaker 2>doctrine is unit that the sort of basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies lead to destabilization.</v>

589
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:24.224
<v Speaker 2>If those regimes just one putting on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up on that Jason and see that 20% </v>

590
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 2>hike by the Federal Reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that part of the scheme?</v>

591
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.274
<v Speaker 2>How can they get that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was not exactly part of the </v>

592
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:33.824
<v Speaker 2>scheme actually that had to do with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a domestic problem in the u s at </v>

593
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:37.514
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the US was suffering with what we </v>

594
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 2>call stagflation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

595
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.000
<v Speaker 2>start closure to doctor Tracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's Mrs is involved,</v>

596
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.040
<v Speaker 2>will know our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm embarrassed.</v>

597
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.460
<v Speaker 2>It was basically high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation but low levels of growth.</v>

598
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 2>And so they had to figure out some way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

599
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.303
<v Speaker 2>to increase levels of growth again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the rich people were really </v>

600
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:00.170
<v Speaker 2>upset that they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't gaining,</v>

601
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 2>a fair income share.</v>

603
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 2>And so they figured out that they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they raised interest rates,</v>

604
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>it would basically cause a recession in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s it would empty out the,</v>

605
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.433
<v Speaker 2>is break the back of the labor unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are very powerful at time and a </v>

606
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 2>and decrease the price of labor which </v>
<v Speaker 2>has succeeded in doing,</v>

607
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a result of the cost of labor in </v>

608
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>the u s has not risen since 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can imagine that.</v>

609
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.863
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was to solve a domestic political </v>

610
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had these ramifications around the</v>

611
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:25.874
<v Speaker 2>world that changed the way the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>works for ultimately for the benefit of </v>

612
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:30.710
<v Speaker 2>the same interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

613
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 2>because the Wall Street said to IMF,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go roll over these lounge.</v>

614
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>

615
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:36.404
<v Speaker 2>As long as you adopt these systems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are amenable to our world view and </v>

616
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:41.714
<v Speaker 2>everyone's cushy jobs or garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very good at describing these </v>

617
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 2>things in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

618
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I can understand because I understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that justin now good.</v>

619
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to do.</v>

620
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.611
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

621
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm hungry too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of guys,</v>

622
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I would say most people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

623
00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.213
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting as the people were so </v>

624
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 2>angry that they took to the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>masses,</v>

625
00:26:04.581 --> 00:26:05.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

626
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>so these structural adjustment programs </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut like caused per capita income growth</v>

627
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:14.441
<v Speaker 2>rates to collapse from a high of 3.2%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really high for the south down</v>

628
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>to 0.7%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically economic crisis,</v>

629
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Africa,</v>

630
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 2>we start incomes actually decline over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>decade or more.</v>

631
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.424
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

632
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 2>this caused millions of people to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed into poverty.</v>

633
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 2>It was a complete travesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

634
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 2>it was the greatest single cause of </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

635
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

636
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.513
<v Speaker 2>in the 20th century after colonialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people understandably took to the </v>

637
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

638
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what we called IMF riots,</v>

639
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 2>but what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that,</v>

641
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:42.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they complained to their </v>

642
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:44.431
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

643
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:45.264
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>stop these austerity policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically that's what they are.</v>

645
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.811
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 2>we want to go back to the fair economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies we had before.</v>

647
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:52.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing is that global </v>

648
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:54.594
<v Speaker 2>south countries themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governments themselves couldn't do </v>

649
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>anything about it because control of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>macro economic policymaking in,</v>

650
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these countries had been shifted to </v>

651
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 2>bankers and technocrats in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York.</v>

652
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in fact,</v>

653
00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 2>structural adjustment had worked as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of bloodless coup,</v>

654
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one fell stroke almost.</v>

655
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:12.594
<v Speaker 2>They were able to establish effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over economic policymaking </v>

656
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 2>processes in the global south.</v>

657
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.653
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy at their level of a state </v>

658
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:22.584
<v Speaker 1>level was irrelevant and redundant </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the economic strings are held </v>

659
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And brought,</v>

660
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you just said there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

661
00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 1>about economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economics,</v>

662
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:35.210
<v Speaker 1>he's not some objective sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yanis Varoufakis anywhere in there.</v>

663
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.473
<v Speaker 1>And as I'm learning from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a model for man for </v>

664
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.973
<v Speaker 1>maintaining inequality that all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are all trouble by certain </v>

665
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:45.804
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are allowed to shift the </v>

666
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change rules,</v>

667
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.013
<v Speaker 1>some people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a way of continually managing </v>

668
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:51.580
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

669
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

670
00:27:52.301 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand is that is that flows of,</v>

671
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.483
<v Speaker 2>of resources and wealth around the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>all have to do with the rules of the </v>

672
00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:01.450
<v Speaker 2>global economy and who gets to set those</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

673
00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

674
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

675
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 2>in the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically beginning then is when a power</v>

676
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:09.130
<v Speaker 2>over these rules was centralized and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

677
00:28:09.131 --> 00:28:11.140
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the World Bank and in Wall Street and</v>

678
00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:11.974
<v Speaker 2>the IMF,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get rid of with them every </v>

679
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:13.961
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean personally,</v>

681
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:16.240
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that.</v>

682
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think that's a radical </v>

683
00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:19.760
<v Speaker 2>position actually since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

684
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.260
<v Speaker 2>most people in the global south have </v>
<v Speaker 2>made the same demands for a long time.</v>

685
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

686
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.993
<v Speaker 1>why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for asking questions that 12 </v>

687
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:27.914
<v Speaker 1>year old to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't the like some of those </v>

688
00:28:29.721 --> 00:28:31.520
<v Speaker 1>countries in the globe which have to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and pay in that stuff?</v>

689
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>No more like these are what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Greece.</v>

690
00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:34.514
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went because you were just saying </v>

691
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.883
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mate,</v>

692
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>why can't you do that?</v>

693
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.683
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's such a good question </v>

694
00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:41.050
<v Speaker 2>because the other option the global </v>
<v Speaker 2>south countries had,</v>

695
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.913
<v Speaker 2>instead of submitting the structural </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustment would have been to just </v>

696
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 2>default on their loans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now there's,</v>

697
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 2>there's some problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

698
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 1980s,</v>

699
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody tried.</v>

700
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

701
00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 2>this is such an inspiring story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

702
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named Thomas Sankara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the president,</v>

703
00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 2>the revolutionary president of Burkina </v>
<v Speaker 2>Faso,</v>

704
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:01.750
<v Speaker 2>a west African country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a young man.</v>

705
00:29:01.751 --> 00:29:02.584
<v Speaker 2>He was a brilliant social reformer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was considered the Shag with our of </v>

706
00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool mate.</v>

707
00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.380
<v Speaker 2>And you can listen to his speeches </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

708
00:29:08.381 --> 00:29:10.030
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really an inspiring guy.</v>

709
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Sankara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Sankara.</v>

710
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Thomas Sankara as president of </v>

711
00:29:15.371 --> 00:29:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Burkina Faso stood up in the halls of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the African Union.</v>

712
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early 1980s,</v>

713
00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I went to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

714
00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:21.784
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gave his famous speech against </v>

715
00:29:23.651 --> 00:29:24.484
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

716
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.733
<v Speaker 2>comrades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically debt is a form of </v>

718
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.410
<v Speaker 2>neocolonialism.</v>

719
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It means that the west gets to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>

720
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.883
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of economic policy in our </v>

721
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:35.020
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what he said.</v>

722
00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:36.760
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about debt.</v>

723
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do not pay it,</v>

724
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 2>nobody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We surely die.</v>

725
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.613
<v Speaker 2>And it was interesting cause the room </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrified and he basically like </v>

726
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 2>started a kind of a revolution against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debt,</v>

727
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:51.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And three months later he was </v>

728
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 2>assassinated in a French backed coup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

729
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and so here's the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it does it for Thomas.</v>

730
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a good looking guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say.</v>

731
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.403
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she's come up with a brilliant </v>

732
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.733
<v Speaker 1>bloody revolution against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we would have a look at him in </v>

733
00:30:12.321 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

734
00:30:13.191 --> 00:30:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he sounds like a bloody hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these terms.</v>

735
00:30:15.951 --> 00:30:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

736
00:30:16.851 --> 00:30:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I like that there is a sort of a,</v>

737
00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:22.730
<v Speaker 1>another way of crow barring sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonialism in to the mix.</v>

738
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.290
<v Speaker 1>When I was thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.820
<v Speaker 1>these rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think about these rules.</v>

740
00:30:26.821 --> 00:30:28.730
<v Speaker 1>He's economic rules that dominate global</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade,</v>

741
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:33.230
<v Speaker 1>global trade and the flow of resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world as a sort of objective.</v>

742
00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.690
<v Speaker 1>But they are of course determined by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

743
00:30:35.691 --> 00:30:36.524
<v Speaker 1>So we should look very carefully at </v>
<v Speaker 1>these non national transcendent global </v>

744
00:30:39.561 --> 00:30:40.394
<v Speaker 1>organizations such as the IMF and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I keep thinking of of wrestling </v>

745
00:30:43.611 --> 00:30:44.444
<v Speaker 1>organizations because they are set in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structures that mean that change is </v>

746
00:30:47.931 --> 00:30:48.800
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

747
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that just occurred to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when people say like,</v>

748
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the answer?</v>

749
00:30:52.101 --> 00:30:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Redistribution of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But redistribution of wealth,</v>

750
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.873
<v Speaker 1>what's been happening all along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth of the south has been </v>

751
00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 1>redistributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

752
00:30:59.150 --> 00:30:59.983
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course this isn't just happening </v>

753
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.160
<v Speaker 1>on a global level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening on the level of caste and</v>

754
00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:06.410
<v Speaker 1>class within each of these countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's loads of people.</v>

755
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Of course you look out this window here </v>
<v Speaker 1>in London,</v>

756
00:31:08.421 --> 00:31:09.254
<v Speaker 1>Leicester Square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see people that are in the </v>

757
00:31:10.281 --> 00:31:11.114
<v Speaker 1>globe and global norm and it ain't going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to well for their mind or they're </v>

758
00:31:12.891 --> 00:31:15.140
<v Speaker 1>sleeping out there on those streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

759
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I suppose really what's required is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideological shift.</v>

760
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

762
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:23.224
<v Speaker 1>the self corrective measures that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>applied in some of the countries in the </v>

763
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.343
<v Speaker 1>70s that brought about that economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>miracle on a national level of </v>

764
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:34.010
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalization and our protective trade</v>

765
00:31:34.011 --> 00:31:36.560
<v Speaker 1>tariffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like at this point,</v>

766
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.080
<v Speaker 1>we need a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

767
00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:39.914
<v Speaker 1>presenting those kind of ideas on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>our global level or just popularizing </v>

768
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:46.730
<v Speaker 1>the idea so perhaps parties could run on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

769
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.713
<v Speaker 1>Cause I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it now after what happened </v>

770
00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:50.270
<v Speaker 1>with [inaudible] in Greece and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

771
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.113
<v Speaker 1>and sort of what's happening in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country of Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie </v>

772
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Sanders in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the USA.</v>

773
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

774
00:31:55.281 --> 00:31:57.890
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did have a lead like Corbyn got in,</v>

775
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 1>would these global institutions prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>real change from being enacted?</v>

776
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.900
<v Speaker 1>What day?</v>

777
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

778
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.693
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to answer a question from </v>

779
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 2>this morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

780
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.913
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose one of the most important </v>

781
00:32:13.701 --> 00:32:14.840
<v Speaker 2>interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

782
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.960
<v Speaker 2>is to cancel the debts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really mean that.</v>

783
00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's forgive some ducks,</v>

784
00:32:20.181 --> 00:32:22.610
<v Speaker 2>which suggests like somehow they sins</v>

785
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.980
<v Speaker 1>raw these debts anyway.</v>

786
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

787
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.573
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them actually were accumulated </v>

788
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.620
<v Speaker 2>during the 1970s after the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the oil crisis in 1973.</v>

789
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what it meant is that in order</v>

790
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

791
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.603
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fund their own consumption in global </v>

792
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 2>south countries had to borrow tons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money because the price,</v>

793
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 2>the price of oil was so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

794
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.780
<v Speaker 2>and so a lot of these deaths are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually still hanging around since 1972</v>

795
00:32:45.781 --> 00:32:46.614
<v Speaker 2>some even older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of the miracle of compound </v>

796
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them have been paid,</v>

797
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.070
<v Speaker 2>paid off many times over already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet they're still paying them off.</v>

798
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 2>And so it's kind of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

799
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem in two ways.</v>

800
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a flow.</v>

801
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like a flood of cash that goes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor countries directly to banks.</v>

802
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Mostly in rich countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

803
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.203
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is that means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that governments don't have effective </v>

804
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>control over their own policymaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economical.</v>

805
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So if you cancel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

806
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a radical way,</v>

807
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.430
<v Speaker 2>which would require of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

808
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Speaker 2>global south countries getting together </v>
<v Speaker 2>to resist a debt to refute,</v>

809
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Speaker 2>to collectively refused repayments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

810
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 2>they can't assassinate them all at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time that we look bad,</v>

811
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.703
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

812
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

813
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you free,</v>

814
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 2>then countries are freed up to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>

815
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Fellows like you don't want the nor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

816
00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canceling them.</v>

817
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.700
<v Speaker 1>You just want a sound guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ain't paying him.</v>

818
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.690
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

819
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.580
<v Speaker 1>we're not Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you canceling or not,</v>

820
00:33:39.581 --> 00:33:41.560
<v Speaker 1>we're canceling them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just not paying it.</v>

821
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.940
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what's required now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose what historically what the panel</v>

822
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

823
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.510
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the assassination of people that propose</v>

824
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.553
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of measures and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement with regimes that are </v>

825
00:33:53.711 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 1>friendly to the objectives if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

826
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.820
<v Speaker 1>the institutions that continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

827
00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.163
<v Speaker 1>So what was I suppose like interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is whether or not new alliances can be </v>

828
00:34:03.461 --> 00:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel sort of naturally more of</v>

829
00:34:05.651 --> 00:34:06.484
<v Speaker 1>an affinity with the people that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be canceling that rather than the debt </v>

830
00:34:08.861 --> 00:34:09.521
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm,</v>

831
00:34:09.521 --> 00:34:10.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the lovely studio in the global </v>

832
00:34:11.981 --> 00:34:13.630
<v Speaker 1>north and I'm doing pretty well.</v>

833
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's maybe </v>

834
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:16.544
<v Speaker 2>increasingly true because if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of people who have student </v>

835
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 2>debt in the u s I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's $1 trillion of student debt right</v>

836
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:22.184
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also realize that there was a real </v>

837
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 2>problem with the debt system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

838
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

839
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 2>if you can start building sort of at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least conceptual alliances across,</v>

840
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:31.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across these different classes of </v>

841
00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 2>debtors and I think that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of free yourself to imagine</v>

842
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 2>a world without it canceled debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

843
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.410
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where resistant.</v>

844
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.880
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I was thinking again </v>
<v Speaker 1>with ankle,</v>

846
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:46.870
<v Speaker 1>we're just like that like with we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>prioritizing economic systems,</v>

847
00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:47.704
<v Speaker 1>which are fictions of fabrications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly concepts that have been </v>

848
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:56.800
<v Speaker 1>created by mankind with firing them over</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual factual material,</v>

849
00:34:56.801 --> 00:35:01.750
<v Speaker 1>physical things like the planet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meteorological systems.</v>

850
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all this,</v>

851
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.820
<v Speaker 1>like with what you're saying about debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>management and trade manipulation,</v>

852
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.773
<v Speaker 1>some countries have resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like how has the country like Africa </v>

853
00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:13.360
<v Speaker 1>that it's mineral rich or like Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

854
00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:16.000
<v Speaker 1>we've all of its agriculture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals,</v>

855
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>how were they poor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can produce those things,</v>

856
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:20.650
<v Speaker 1>then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've produced those things.</v>

857
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:21.703
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We clearly what's required is like on </v>

858
00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:28.300
<v Speaker 1>one level they a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at economics on a global basis,</v>

859
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.283
<v Speaker 1>but that's going to mean the obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that does is it challenges the </v>

860
00:35:32.951 --> 00:35:33.784
<v Speaker 1>interests of the people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the system as it currently </v>

861
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 1>stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ultimately you arrive at a point,</v>

862
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

863
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:43.134
<v Speaker 1>where what is required?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an like you've said these </v>

864
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 1>things out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these ideas are out there,</v>

865
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You popularize these ideas.</v>

866
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 1>At what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does the rubber meet the road?</v>

867
00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Is our American coffin say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does it become like,</v>

868
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing this,</v>

869
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to shut down this.</v>

870
00:35:57.751 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 1>We're going to shut down that who is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy?</v>

871
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Who Do we target?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do I stand or do we do?</v>

872
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:03.961
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

873
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I'm going to,</v>

874
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I guess we could brainstorm right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

875
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the important first step is to free </v>

877
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:11.604
<v Speaker 2>ourselves of these false narratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>about aid and development that we have </v>

878
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

879
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

880
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

881
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

882
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:18.990
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

883
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

884
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>debt cancellation I think is essential </v>

885
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:23.360
<v Speaker 2>democratizing the world system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The central,</v>

886
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I was going to mention earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to mention the importance of</v>

887
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 2>a fairer international wage system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

888
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.821
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:30.654
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wages in the south are much lower than </v>

890
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 2>in the north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

891
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's possible actually to,</v>

892
00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 2>to bring in a kind of global minimum </v>
<v Speaker 2>wage system.</v>

893
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 2>It would be governed by the UN through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the International Labor Organization.</v>

894
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.053
<v Speaker 2>And you would set the minimum wage at </v>
<v Speaker 2>50% of each country median wage and </v>

895
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:46.480
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

896
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you would eradicate working poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much overnights.</v>

897
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.293
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this proposal's been made by number </v>

898
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:52.734
<v Speaker 2>of economists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that there's a system in place </v>

899
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 2>that's capable of handling it.</v>

900
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.360
<v Speaker 1>What's the counter argument?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do people say you can't do that by,</v>

901
00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:01.420
<v Speaker 1>that would lead to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is their argument for why you can't</v>

902
00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:02.254
<v Speaker 1>do stuff like that?</v>

903
00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there are going to be that's um,</v>

904
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

905
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.053
<v Speaker 2>well I guess I guess proper new liberals</v>
<v Speaker 2>that say you should never regulate </v>

906
00:37:09.251 --> 00:37:10.660
<v Speaker 2>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

907
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the way that I see it,</v>

908
00:37:12.491 --> 00:37:14.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to have a system where,</v>

909
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where capitalism is globalized,</v>

910
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.733
<v Speaker 2>then it only stands to reason that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need a system where the rules that </v>

911
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.810
<v Speaker 2>regulate capitalism or also globalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

912
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the way that I would,</v>

913
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.910
<v Speaker 1>so if you have global free movement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital,</v>

914
00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:30.130
<v Speaker 1>you need global free movement of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

915
00:37:30.131 --> 00:37:32.710
<v Speaker 1>of workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have global capitalism,</v>

916
00:37:32.711 --> 00:37:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you need global regulation if the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are paid.</v>

917
00:37:35.741 --> 00:37:38.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up system.</v>

918
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just having a look at some of the bogey </v>

919
00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:43.330
<v Speaker 1>man of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's benefiting from this?</v>

920
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 1>What about companies like a big billy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elo,</v>

921
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:48.530
<v Speaker 1>sue's superior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transnational companies like apple,</v>

922
00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:49.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with them?</v>

923
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Haven't you got some sort of terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to tell us about them?</v>

924
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

925
00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

926
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I guess apple is only one of many </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that,</v>

927
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that only really exists because they're </v>

928
00:37:59.271 --> 00:38:00.530
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

929
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 2>to exploit very cheap labor and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>global south.</v>

930
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

931
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 2>at some point I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

932
00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>trump even said to the CEO of apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

933
00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:10.730
<v Speaker 2>you need to bring these factories back </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

934
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.130
<v Speaker 2>It was a trump or maybe somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

935
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:14.570
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these factors are not going back home.</v>

936
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple cannot come,</v>

937
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 2>has no business model.</v>

938
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.553
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless we've got little bullies mining </v>

939
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.550
<v Speaker 1>in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I looked at,</v>

940
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.070
<v Speaker 1>we saw we'd made a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

941
00:38:24.071 --> 00:38:26.510
<v Speaker 1>an episode of the it on a news thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

942
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.670
<v Speaker 1>And it was when it Gareth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that some,</v>

943
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.543
<v Speaker 1>some just arse achingly terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about little children are mining for </v>

944
00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:36.790
<v Speaker 1>this results that's in your iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sort of watch it and think,</v>

945
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:41.130
<v Speaker 1>oh bloody hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like you sort of unimaginable uh,</v>

946
00:38:41.131 --> 00:38:44.450
<v Speaker 1>in a dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want to say?</v>

947
00:38:44.451 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Sort of negligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty,</v>

948
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.373
<v Speaker 1>irresponsibility that we don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>countenance when you hold an apple </v>

949
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:52.594
<v Speaker 1>iphone or an ipad in your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think and you're encouraged </v>

950
00:38:56.531 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 1>not to think of what the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are.</v>

951
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Speaker 1>And for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like we're,</v>

952
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.353
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already been bread and inculcated to </v>

953
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 1>think as consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as an individual,</v>

955
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 1>although I am willing to do it to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>let go of,</v>

956
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this product or that product,</v>

957
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>this privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that privilege people continually.</v>

958
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not sort of basically homeless</v>

959
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:19.414
<v Speaker 1>or living in a commune people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you give up your call and </v>

960
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 1>then what did you can about this then </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you go at that?</v>

961
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.473
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think these things are all valid </v>

962
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 1>arguments as part of a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilization of significant change.</v>

963
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.563
<v Speaker 1>But you can see that any gestural move </v>
<v Speaker 1>from any individual is of little value </v>

964
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.910
<v Speaker 1>unless there's a sort of targeted </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

965
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.953
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I read once in </v>
<v Speaker 1>adbusters that I really liked were </v>

966
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:40.654
<v Speaker 1>saying like pick a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations to really target and </v>

967
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 1>annihilate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of saying like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you could sort of like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

970
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 1>they outlined how a few corporations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hugely transgressed.</v>

971
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:53.280
<v Speaker 1>General Motors with their irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

972
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.363
<v Speaker 1>not recalling cars that they knew were </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people because it works out </v>

973
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:57.484
<v Speaker 1>economically better to leave them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and pay the lawsuits or Phillip </v>

974
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Morris knowing for years that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco is killing people.</v>

975
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Or even what you're saying there like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

976
00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:09.150
<v Speaker 1>a big friendly and attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization like Apple Look,</v>

977
00:40:09.151 --> 00:40:09.984
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose products I own and use and will </v>

978
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 1>use within the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

979
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:14.224
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people will be listening to this </v>

980
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 1>podcast on those phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

981
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:17.284
<v Speaker 1>we are all participating in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're participating from this </v>

982
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.831
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems,</v>

983
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:21.664
<v Speaker 1>Jason of impotence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I feel that because they are </v>

984
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:26.663
<v Speaker 1>really what we ended up discussing here </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't narratives the way that stories </v>

985
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>are told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't think it's possible to have</v>

986
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:37.780
<v Speaker 1>significant change unless we come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves with stories,</v>

987
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.673
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectives that are accessible and </v>

988
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change won't happen.</v>

989
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to sort of start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

990
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 1>getting people out on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banging a drum to bloody demetra,</v>

991
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 1>democratize the IMF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to make people do that.</v>

992
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

993
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or interest people in that even,</v>

994
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.840
<v Speaker 2>here's the way that I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

996
00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess first of all,</v>

997
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

998
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.753
<v Speaker 2>this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of seeing about changing our own </v>

999
00:41:03.051 --> 00:41:04.970
<v Speaker 2>personal consumption habits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is important.</v>

1000
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:05.804
<v Speaker 2>But what's much more important is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we organize collectively to create a </v>

1001
00:41:08.931 --> 00:41:09.764
<v Speaker 2>system in which it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not possible in the first place </v>

1002
00:41:12.081 --> 00:41:13.820
<v Speaker 2>that apple can be exploiting workers </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1003
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1004
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we need to kind of collective </v>

1005
00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.580
<v Speaker 2>solidarity before we just need personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1006
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1007
00:41:21.951 --> 00:41:22.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1008
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.860
<v Speaker 1>do you feel collective solidarity with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1009
00:41:24.861 --> 00:41:28.010
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel if that's something that you</v>

1010
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.263
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an anthropologist or an </v>

1011
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:31.124
<v Speaker 1>economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching young people about this </v>

1012
00:41:32.691 --> 00:41:35.050
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you're only 34 years old,</v>

1013
00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you're like some sort of gorgeous boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>band professor,</v>

1014
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>sorry to objectify you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did it to that man in Africa.</v>

1015
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.431
<v Speaker 1>So unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 1>so do you feel the sense that this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of solidarity,</v>

1017
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm even now watching a man who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined from Latin America emptying out</v>

1018
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 1>garbage here at global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1019
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:53.684
<v Speaker 1>and let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1020
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1021
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>this is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all around us.</v>

1022
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 1>This is us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1023
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it very difficult to get purchase</v>

1024
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 1>to understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what shall I do now then?</v>

1025
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:09.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think there is a real appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the sort of,</v>

1026
00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:09.944
<v Speaker 1>the surprising result of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>election for the success of Bernie </v>

1027
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Sanders to a degree.</v>

1028
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I like all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>points of people's appetite for change.</v>

1029
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 1>And like it's only the fact that stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1030
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:19.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up like when our garages for old </v>

1031
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 1>at that coup in Nicaragua and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bloody Pinochet and all that,</v>

1032
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you just think that's how things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to be out.</v>

1033
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even like the struggle in Ireland,</v>

1034
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I sort of grew up with the view your </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse to have,</v>

1035
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1036
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to get these stories</v>

1037
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:35.624
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we emotionally engage people </v>

1038
00:42:37.881 --> 00:42:38.714
<v Speaker 1>around sort of economic arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>always feel abstract cause they are </v>

1039
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:41.534
<v Speaker 1>bloody abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a little kid mine in for </v>

1040
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:43.850
<v Speaker 1>some minerals somewhere.</v>

1041
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1042
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need better and more powerful and can</v>

1043
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:49.050
<v Speaker 2>more convincing stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1044
00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:51.570
<v Speaker 2>think about the power of the existing </v>
<v Speaker 2>development narrative.</v>

1045
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.970
<v Speaker 2>So we need something that will tear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>

1046
00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.350
<v Speaker 2>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1047
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a rival to it.</v>

1048
00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

1049
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no question that,</v>

1050
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.343
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are more inspiring and more </v>

1051
00:43:03.211 --> 00:43:04.590
<v Speaker 2>convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

1052
00:43:04.591 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see it in my,</v>

1053
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.720
<v Speaker 2>in my own students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1054
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:08.123
<v Speaker 2>Like they all went to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these little ideas about aid </v>

1055
00:43:11.251 --> 00:43:12.084
<v Speaker 2>and microfinance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It w as soon as you explained to them </v>

1056
00:43:13.531 --> 00:43:15.630
<v Speaker 2>how the world actually works in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the global economy,</v>

1057
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and point them in the direction of real </v>

1058
00:43:17.821 --> 00:43:20.130
<v Speaker 2>structural change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so excited about that.</v>

1059
00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:22.360
<v Speaker 2>And now imagine if the millions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1060
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.430
<v Speaker 2>of people in Britain who are part of gap</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and other like student development</v>

1061
00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:28.330
<v Speaker 2>projects or NGOs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1062
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.810
<v Speaker 2>and the hundreds of billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are in the industry.</v>

1063
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was channeled in to </v>
<v Speaker 2>making the world fair.</v>

1064
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would change radically,</v>

1065
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.473
<v Speaker 2>radically and dramatically and would not</v>
<v Speaker 2>require a single drop of additional </v>

1066
00:43:38.671 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 2>foreign aid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1067
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.700
<v Speaker 2>in order to eradicate poverty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>

1068
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.333
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like it'd be nice to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little five point plan of five </v>

1069
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:47.160
<v Speaker 1>things that would radically change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1070
00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go right,</v>

1071
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.823
<v Speaker 1>here are five ideas that if these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were implemented were radically changed </v>

1072
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:52.044
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you'd hear is </v>

1073
00:43:53.101 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the people whose interests are currently</v>
<v Speaker 1>being served,</v>

1074
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.303
<v Speaker 1>telling you aggressively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly why these things won't work </v>

1075
00:43:59.281 --> 00:44:00.091
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1076
00:44:00.091 --> 00:44:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about time issue personally say</v>

1077
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:05.260
<v Speaker 1>that you're mad and you don't ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 1>write to express those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>

1079
00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:07.644
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of stuff that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it'll be good to distill it down to </v>

1080
00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 1>five simple things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are some of those ideas you were</v>

1081
00:44:12.001 --> 00:44:12.834
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive debt cancellation or for </v>

1082
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody cancel all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really cool one.</v>

1083
00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's get rid of my mortgage.</v>

1084
00:44:18.991 --> 00:44:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm in and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1085
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1086
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.063
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some of the other ones at </v>

1087
00:44:24.191 --> 00:44:27.540
<v Speaker 1>global minimum wage of 50% of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>national median.</v>

1088
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good one.</v>

1089
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we're aiming for now.</v>

1090
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.743
<v Speaker 1>We of a few more cause it literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to organize a global revolution </v>

1091
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 1>during this podcast.</v>

1092
00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1093
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1094
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.173
<v Speaker 2>so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the second to last chapter of my </v>

1095
00:44:40.091 --> 00:44:40.924
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually have in fact a list of </v>

1096
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:44.860
<v Speaker 2>exactly five things we can do to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>the global economy.</v>

1097
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.873
<v Speaker 2>It's allison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've already talked about a lot of </v>

1098
00:44:47.231 --> 00:44:47.960
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have debts,</v>

1099
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.750
<v Speaker 2>we have counseling debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the,</v>

1100
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the changing the wage system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1101
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:52.923
<v Speaker 2>we have democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratizing global governance of </v>

1102
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.930
<v Speaker 2>economic policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1103
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are easy ways we can,</v>

1104
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.833
<v Speaker 2>we can change the international trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to make it much fair to poor </v>

1105
00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:02.950
<v Speaker 2>countries as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1106
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

1107
00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.790
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.043
<v Speaker 2>because of the WTO is your way around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came into effect in 1990 is a </v>

1110
00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.483
<v Speaker 2>global south countries are losing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average 700 billion US dollars in </v>

1111
00:45:16.571 --> 00:45:20.710
<v Speaker 2>potential GDP per year because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalances in the,</v>

1112
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.360
<v Speaker 2>in the WTO trading structure.</v>

1113
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:23.583
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's seven times more than they </v>

1114
00:45:25.061 --> 00:45:26.260
<v Speaker 2>receive an aid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1115
00:45:26.261 --> 00:45:28.760
<v Speaker 2>So this is a major cause of Glen Mullen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 80 relevant.</v>

1116
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:29.903
<v Speaker 2>It is completely irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the book I lay out ways that we </v>

1117
00:45:31.991 --> 00:45:33.440
<v Speaker 2>can change the trade system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1118
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.293
<v Speaker 2>and then also I think that a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucial one here is thinking about </v>

1119
00:45:36.371 --> 00:45:38.170
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here's the deal.</v>

1120
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:42.460
<v Speaker 2>We know for a fact that the vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of historical emissions,</v>

1121
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70% of them in fact have come from,</v>

1122
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from industrialized countries in the </v>

1123
00:45:47.171 --> 00:45:48.004
<v Speaker 2>West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1124
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.083
<v Speaker 2>But the vast bulk of the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change are hitting the global </v>

1125
00:45:51.911 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Speaker 2>south really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dramatically,</v>

1126
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:55.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through wildfires,</v>

1127
00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.030
<v Speaker 2>droughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1128
00:45:58.031 --> 00:45:59.170
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1129
00:45:59.200 --> 00:45:59.881
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1130
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and as a result of climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Global South countries are losing in the</v>

1131
00:46:03.281 --> 00:46:06.850
<v Speaker 2>region of $500 billion per year in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of losses and,</v>

1132
00:46:06.851 --> 00:46:07.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.060
<v Speaker 2>which again outstrips the aid budget by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a factor of five there.</v>

1134
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.193
<v Speaker 2>So we needed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need much more rigorous action on </v>

1135
00:46:13.931 --> 00:46:15.370
<v Speaker 2>climate change to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1136
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.480
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1137
00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.650
<v Speaker 2>to get rich countries to reduce that</v>

1138
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:18.943
<v Speaker 1>points point to all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these proposed regulations mean </v>

1139
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.340
<v Speaker 1>that powerful economic interests will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>curved and confronted.</v>

1140
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine them ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of history sort of looks to me</v>

1141
00:46:32.091 --> 00:46:33.950
<v Speaker 1>like at a glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I've ever given it.</v>

1142
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.333
<v Speaker 1>Like a saw a struggle between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and the powerless with the </v>

1143
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:40.970
<v Speaker 1>powerful conceding the bare minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of power.</v>

1144
00:46:40.971 --> 00:46:42.380
<v Speaker 1>They can concede everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1145
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.790
<v Speaker 1>bloody hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women want the vote.</v>

1146
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.280
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't have slavery anymore.</v>

1147
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1148
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.891
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me in.</v>

1149
00:46:47.891 --> 00:46:48.724
<v Speaker 1>They just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'll go hang onto it for as long </v>

1150
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:53.030
<v Speaker 1>as they can and then give the minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in each case you would say,</v>

1151
00:46:53.031 --> 00:46:53.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1152
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:54.404
<v Speaker 1>like here we are all these years after </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffrage and women is still exploited </v>

1153
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:00.740
<v Speaker 1>and not paid as much as men in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

1154
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Look what's happening around race and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to happen around race.</v>

1155
00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.453
<v Speaker 1>So these things in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move slowly unless they're sort of </v>

1156
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:08.924
<v Speaker 1>radical systemic change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think it's unlikely for </v>

1157
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:16.001
<v Speaker 1>radical systemic change to be bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>around without force and death?</v>

1158
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1159
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1160
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.313
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the system we have right now </v>

1161
00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.860
<v Speaker 2>is a kind of global apartheid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1162
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1163
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:28.674
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just as the anti apartheid struggle </v>

1164
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in South Africa required,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1165
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immense collective mobilization,</v>

1166
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:35.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the same as going to be true of </v>

1167
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 2>the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to abolish global apartheid.</v>

1168
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1169
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1170
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 2>will it end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 2>and conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1172
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And historically when attempts have been</v>

1173
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 2>made to make the world fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that has been the case.</v>

1174
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1175
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.141
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1176
00:47:52.141 --> 00:47:54.190
<v Speaker 2>what is promising is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1177
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.320
<v Speaker 2>is that people around the global south </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1178
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 2>are increasingly conscious of how unfair</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system is to them.</v>

1179
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.190
<v Speaker 2>And they are the majority of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1180
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:02.900
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1181
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.290
<v Speaker 2>and the more and more that we include </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in our,</v>

1182
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.740
<v Speaker 2>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our discussions and our,</v>

1183
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 2>in our discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Internet,</v>

1184
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 2>through our media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1185
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1186
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 2>the more of this message is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come through.</v>

1187
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.123
<v Speaker 1>But how do we galvanize some working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class white bloke in dunk cost r and d </v>

1188
00:48:18.181 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 1>day six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:22.260
<v Speaker 1>because they similarly are suffering as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of this economic system.</v>

1190
00:48:22.261 --> 00:48:24.060
<v Speaker 1>But they're not going to start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh are,</v>

1191
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with some bloke in Chile,</v>

1192
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you have a global movement?</v>

1193
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.863
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this isn't just happening in the </v>

1194
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:32.994
<v Speaker 1>global south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like during the time that we've been </v>

1195
00:48:34.021 --> 00:48:35.760
<v Speaker 1>doing this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1196
00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:38.610
<v Speaker 1>there's people probably minimum wage </v>
<v Speaker 1>worker.</v>

1197
00:48:38.611 --> 00:48:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is a business that I imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not take the risk of paying people</v>

1198
00:48:42.721 --> 00:48:43.554
<v Speaker 1>below minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they'll probably outsourced to </v>

1199
00:48:45.241 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 1>a cleaning company that are using people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have got,</v>

1200
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.280
<v Speaker 1>knows how their document it or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1201
00:48:50.281 --> 00:48:54.870
<v Speaker 1>to like say like this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispherically divided.</v>

1202
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.280
<v Speaker 1>This is everywhere.</v>

1203
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's definitely true.</v>

1204
00:48:57.741 --> 00:49:00.320
<v Speaker 2>We can definitely see elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south right here in the north.</v>

1205
00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:01.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1206
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.490
<v Speaker 2>and not just actually people from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>south who are suffering,</v>

1207
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among us.</v>

1208
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:07.760
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the same dynamics,</v>

1209
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:08.631
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1210
00:49:08.631 --> 00:49:09.920
<v Speaker 2>of the south like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:49:09.921 --> 00:49:10.754
<v Speaker 2>slums and horrible health care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health care conditions and so on are </v>

1212
00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:14.330
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1213
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in global north countries themselves.</v>

1214
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you are an expert.</v>

1215
00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.920
<v Speaker 1>If I'm picking up from the intro online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of f no graphic stuff.</v>

1216
00:49:21.921 --> 00:49:22.611
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1217
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but like in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all this Charlotesville Lark,</v>

1218
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.473
<v Speaker 1>it's call it last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that sort of like why you went </v>

1219
00:49:29.031 --> 00:49:30.200
<v Speaker 1>to university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

1220
00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1221
00:49:31.251 --> 00:49:32.031
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1222
00:49:32.031 --> 00:49:33.950
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1223
00:49:33.951 --> 00:49:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of for me,</v>

1224
00:49:35.001 --> 00:49:37.340
<v Speaker 1>once people start parading around </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting all Nazi,</v>

1225
00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:40.940
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of a clear indication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel hugely the disempowered.</v>

1226
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1227
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.503
<v Speaker 1>while people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1228
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the sort of covered trump </v>

1229
00:49:45.231 --> 00:49:46.460
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would feel it.</v>

1230
00:49:46.461 --> 00:49:47.294
<v Speaker 1>It's more a somehow acceptable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express more extremist views that that </v>

1231
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:52.124
<v Speaker 1>may be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also those people must be feeling </v>

1232
00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.250
<v Speaker 1>something in order to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and nine know,</v>

1233
00:49:58.251 --> 00:50:03.251
<v Speaker 1>and most people know that what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting is incorrect and immoral,</v>

1234
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.630
<v Speaker 1>but what they're feeling is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are feeling something.</v>

1235
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:10.610
<v Speaker 1>They're feeling anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1236
00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.010
<v Speaker 1>How do we reach those people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do we just go home?</v>

1237
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as well,</v>

1238
00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:16.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1239
00:50:16.581 --> 00:50:18.120
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

1240
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.060
<v Speaker 1>oh this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people need help.</v>

1241
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1242
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree and I'm very torn </v>
<v Speaker 2>because on the one,</v>

1243
00:50:23.851 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1244
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that we absolutely have to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascism wherever it rears its ugly head.</v>

1245
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:29.833
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have to feel a kind of compassion </v>

1246
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:32.460
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1247
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.060
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1248
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.000
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for those who,</v>

1249
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.863
<v Speaker 2>who reached these conclusions because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel immiserated are dispossessed </v>

1250
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.190
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1251
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:39.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1252
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 2>in a legitimate sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1253
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1254
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 2>so to the extent that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who turn to these narratives,</v>

1255
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.093
<v Speaker 2>these white nationalists narratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they feel that the system is </v>

1256
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:48.870
<v Speaker 2>screwing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1257
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.990
<v Speaker 2>in some real sense because the system is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unfair.</v>

1258
00:50:51.991 --> 00:50:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that absolutely we have to,</v>

1259
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 2>we have to work on building their </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

1260
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that these people have not</v>

1261
00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 2>been misdirected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are nonetheless still racist pricks,</v>

1262
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 2>then we can't give them any of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>

1263
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:04.723
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's kind of the way I feel </v>

1264
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:06.044
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1265
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't let that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1266
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know why the practice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a white man.</v>

1267
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.713
<v Speaker 1>But like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when that sort of stuff </v>

1268
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 1>happens and I look at their faces with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those torches,</v>

1269
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:17.900
<v Speaker 1>he's weird stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1270
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel we can't leave people behind.</v>

1271
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:24.284
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious my allegiance lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have people that aren't marching </v>

1273
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:27.464
<v Speaker 1>around with torches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I feel that unless you address </v>

1274
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>the resource rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling,</v>

1275
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.780
<v Speaker 1>unless people like get it goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should they be angry with?</v>

1276
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Their unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can get people a march</v>

1277
00:51:37.701 --> 00:51:38.534
<v Speaker 1>around in the streets of the taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless there's something really </v>

1278
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:42.050
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.003
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless that's addressed then this we'll </v>

1280
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:46.304
<v Speaker 1>reformulate and re manifest the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is clear over the course of our </v>

1281
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

1282
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.613
<v Speaker 1>that the exploitation that came with </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonization route simply re presented </v>

1283
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 1>as globalization that behind the mask </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1284
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1285
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.900
<v Speaker 1>the previous national identity core per </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities,</v>

1286
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 1>we're able to continue the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation,</v>

1287
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.223
<v Speaker 1>making little nods and gestures here or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there when it became impossible to not </v>

1288
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:10.454
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1289
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.413
<v Speaker 1>But to make significant change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start dealing with what </v>

1290
00:52:14.121 --> 00:52:14.954
<v Speaker 1>people are feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in people's hearts and </v>

1291
00:52:17.961 --> 00:52:18.794
<v Speaker 1>minds and spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's really excellent to hear you </v>

1292
00:52:20.751 --> 00:52:23.540
<v Speaker 1>outline how these things have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they've happened,</v>

1293
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.523
<v Speaker 1>and what would need to change in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>for significant redistribution or a </v>

1294
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.340
<v Speaker 1>fairer society to a merge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like a tear,</v>

1295
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.620
<v Speaker 1>unless people can be emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged.</v>

1296
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.543
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how that will happen because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people will have a vague </v>

1297
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is corrupt.</v>

1298
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:40.941
<v Speaker 1>Everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1299
00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:41.774
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think people also feel broadly </v>

1300
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.843
<v Speaker 1>impotent.</v>

1301
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that another,</v>

1302
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 2>another thing we have to consider here </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1303
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:49.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1304
00:52:49.001 --> 00:52:53.120
<v Speaker 2>the south might just take matters into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own hands and already,</v>

1305
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess in a way,</v>

1306
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:57.080
<v Speaker 2>like we're kind of irrelevant to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the struggle.</v>

1307
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean we in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're obviously on the wrong side.</v>

1308
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1309
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.353
<v Speaker 2>so if you look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at what's happening in the </v>

1310
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:04.790
<v Speaker 2>south already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1311
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you have in Latin America you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1312
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>a number of governments working together</v>
<v Speaker 2>to form kind of like,</v>

1313
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:12.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like alternative trade networks that's,</v>

1314
00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1315
00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 2>that are based on fair principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1316
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
00:53:17.601 --> 00:53:18.434
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the rise of alternative </v>

1318
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 2>alternative institutions like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1319
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:24.320
<v Speaker 2>the brics bank and the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Infrastructure Development Bank that are</v>

1320
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:25.154
<v Speaker 2>trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are to provide an alternative to </v>

1321
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 2>the International Monetary Fund and </v>
<v Speaker 2>render these,</v>

1322
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:33.030
<v Speaker 2>these big global organizations </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant right now.</v>

1323
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:33.864
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if that's going to work or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're going to be instruments of </v>

1324
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 2>sort of sub imperial evil for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that run them like China.</v>

1325
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1326
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 2>but at least that's what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do.</v>

1327
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And there's some hope there I think</v>

1328
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps behind these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

1329
00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like that when you were saying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1330
00:53:50.241 --> 00:53:51.470
<v Speaker 1>like when do you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1331
00:53:51.471 --> 00:53:52.304
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we regard the global narrative like </v>

1332
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.310
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just the way things are.</v>

1333
00:53:55.311 --> 00:53:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Some countries have reached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some countries are poor.</v>

1334
00:53:57.231 --> 00:53:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It's because we got our got our up off </v>
<v Speaker 1>our power,</v>

1335
00:53:59.451 --> 00:54:00.284
<v Speaker 1>our season invented the spinning Jenny </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then and then the Vdu and you know </v>

1336
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.453
<v Speaker 1>behind sort of within this there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of concurrent narratives around </v>

1337
00:54:10.131 --> 00:54:15.050
<v Speaker 1>things like Darwinism that underwrite </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of philosophy.</v>

1338
00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:15.884
<v Speaker 1>Survival of the fittest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is a struggle for original season </v>

1339
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:21.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's just a way it is the fittest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the strongest and the best survive.</v>

1340
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.090
<v Speaker 1>These are already sort of selective </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrativize patients.</v>

1341
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.620
<v Speaker 1>If history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanism,</v>

1342
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:27.493
<v Speaker 1>the mechanistic model of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is a bit like a machine </v>

1343
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:31.934
<v Speaker 1>evolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit like a machine selecting and </v>

1344
00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:34.394
<v Speaker 1>making binary choices like it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a underwritten by that kind of </v>

1345
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:39.134
<v Speaker 1>philosophy then why would we be </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate or why would any emergent </v>

1346
00:54:42.561 --> 00:54:45.980
<v Speaker 1>system not resort ultimately to like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1347
00:54:45.981 --> 00:54:46.814
<v Speaker 1>a sub imperial or comparable trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like setting up some rival </v>

1348
00:54:50.151 --> 00:54:52.970
<v Speaker 1>economic model that China's involved in.</v>

1349
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about China but </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

1350
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't look to me like their friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

1351
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.280
<v Speaker 1>fred in flowers for each other's air and</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving each other massages.</v>

1352
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they could be a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>leery bunch as well if it all ever kicks</v>

1353
00:55:04.881 --> 00:55:07.010
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless like,</v>

1354
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are the resources for these rules,</v>

1355
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.110
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we going to come up with a,</v>

1356
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.790
<v Speaker 1>from where do we reach inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and find a philosophy by which</v>

1357
00:55:16.791 --> 00:55:17.624
<v Speaker 1>we can legitimately live and call </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves human and call ourselves </v>

1358
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:24.170
<v Speaker 1>brothers and sisters and custodians of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet.</v>

1359
00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:25.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're what is going to be the resource </v>

1360
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and this is the bit where I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spirituality.</v>

1361
00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually so important.</v>

1362
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have,</v>

1363
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.530
<v Speaker 2>we have to start realizing that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all connected,</v>

1364
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

1365
00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:40.774
<v Speaker 2>that we're brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so essential in it </v>

1366
00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:43.930
<v Speaker 2>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds so silly to say it.</v>

1367
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.833
<v Speaker 1>That's because we've been taught to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's all silly so that people can </v>

1368
00:55:46.581 --> 00:55:47.414
<v Speaker 1>crack on and exploit everyone who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that to lead to be broken and </v>

1369
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>sisters right now shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1370
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 1>cause you're an individual.</v>

1371
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 2>If globalization has done anything good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>

1372
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1373
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.823
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the globalization of our sense of </v>

1374
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1375
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.071
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1376
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1377
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1378
00:56:03.951 --> 00:56:05.700
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely more aware of each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other right now.</v>

1379
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1380
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:07.891
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1381
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:09.140
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to realize that,</v>

1382
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order for us to,</v>

1383
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.770
<v Speaker 2>to create a world where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are,</v>

1384
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.090
<v Speaker 2>we're able to eradicate poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1385
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.373
<v Speaker 2>we need to learn how to share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's so fundamental because </v>

1386
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.673
<v Speaker 2>the narrative that we'd been sold from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in power is that the only way to </v>

1387
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>eradicate poverty is through GDP growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1388
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 2>But we know that on a limited planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we live on a and in an era</v>

1389
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 2>of rapid climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continued GDP growth is not an option.</v>

1390
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:33.723
<v Speaker 2>So without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without growing the GDP and having some </v>

1391
00:56:35.201 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 2>of it trickled down to the poorest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to eradicate poverty?</v>

1392
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 2>The only way to do it is to share what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we already have more fairly.</v>

1393
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's gotta be a realization for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1394
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.773
<v Speaker 2>None of us want to live in a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's marked where 60% of the human </v>

1395
00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 2>population isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is in poverty.</v>

1396
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1397
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to the average bloke on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

1398
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.960
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1399
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 2>and so the key is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to realize what's necessary for us to</v>

1400
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 2>create an alternative world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that really is sharing.</v>

1401
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.983
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly the opposite kind of </v>

1402
00:56:59.831 --> 00:57:02.380
<v Speaker 2>narrative to the one that we've been fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our lives.</v>

1403
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.293
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been underwritten again by </v>

1404
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.560
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of science and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

1405
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Darwinism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like a survival of the fittest and</v>

1406
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:11.670
<v Speaker 1>not suggesting that evolution isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>real?</v>

1407
00:57:11.671 --> 00:57:12.504
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's empirically and provably and </v>

1408
00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:14.460
<v Speaker 1>demonstrable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will,</v>

1409
00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but the implication that we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing with one another for resources</v>

1410
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.280
<v Speaker 1>is there sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's conjecture.</v>

1411
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.740
<v Speaker 1>That's just an idea at different idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be,</v>

1412
00:57:22.741 --> 00:57:25.950
<v Speaker 1>we should be sharing that we are here </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1413
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.240
<v Speaker 1>that our life is individuals is not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as our life as a community.</v>

1414
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Gout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you hold up a question?</v>

1415
00:57:31.561 --> 00:57:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Just their mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

1416
00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And this is a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

1417
00:57:35.341 --> 00:57:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I've just thought up with using my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant little brain.</v>

1418
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Is there any hope within current global </v>
<v Speaker 1>power structures?</v>

1419
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Are there any good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any we can look to optimistically?</v>

1420
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel obliged to say me.</v>

1421
00:57:49.041 --> 00:57:52.610
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some interesting people,</v>

1422
00:57:52.611 --> 00:57:53.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about structural </v>

1423
00:57:54.381 --> 00:57:56.090
<v Speaker 2>adjustment earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crucially,</v>

1424
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.953
<v Speaker 2>those exact same policies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>imposed on the south in the 1980s are </v>

1425
00:58:00.201 --> 00:58:02.090
<v Speaker 2>now being imposed all over southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

1426
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Greece of course,</v>

1427
00:58:03.141 --> 00:58:04.340
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

1428
00:58:04.341 --> 00:58:05.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key example of this.</v>

1429
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1430
00:58:06.981 --> 00:58:07.814
<v Speaker 2>so Greece is being structurally adjusted</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of bailing out French and </v>

1431
00:58:10.101 --> 00:58:12.710
<v Speaker 2>German banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the same thing that happens in</v>

1432
00:58:12.711 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 2>the 1980s for the south and a so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have the emergence of a,</v>

1433
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:18.440
<v Speaker 2>of resistance there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the form is the result,</v>

1434
00:58:18.441 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 2>or at least it was I kind of resistance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Yanis Varoufakis and skate.</v>

1435
00:58:21.671 --> 00:58:23.630
<v Speaker 2>That dude's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a cool guy.</v>

1436
00:58:23.631 --> 00:58:24.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1437
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I like what he has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1438
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are also people,</v>

1439
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:28.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere in the south.</v>

1440
00:58:28.851 --> 00:58:29.684
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1441
00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm the President of Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a gang</v>

1442
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:37.960
<v Speaker 1>global crusaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit like the marvel avengers franchise</v>

1443
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:38.853
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we will go round coming up with </v>

1444
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:45.320
<v Speaker 1>brilliant ideas and then that means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into manic trances,</v>

1445
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 1>preaching it all around the world.</v>

1446
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to do that.</v>

1447
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:52.770
<v Speaker 2>This whole soap speaking him Shamana </v>
<v Speaker 2>chanting.</v>

1448
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:56.040
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the point you made about </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirituality and a,</v>

1449
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like,</v>

1450
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:58.463
<v Speaker 2>look right now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the levels of consumption that we enjoy </v>

1451
00:59:01.201 --> 00:59:03.540
<v Speaker 2>in the West are completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1452
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.630
<v Speaker 2>are completely based on extraction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>plunder in the south.</v>

1453
00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.870
<v Speaker 2>They depends on the immiseration of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1454
00:59:09.871 --> 00:59:10.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1455
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.010
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1456
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.843
<v Speaker 2>in poor countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think that that actually probably </v>

1457
00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:17.130
<v Speaker 2>plays really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really badly for our sense of psyche and</v>

1458
00:59:17.131 --> 00:59:17.964
<v Speaker 2>our inner wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that none of us want to live in </v>

1459
00:59:20.761 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 2>a world like that where deep inside we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that every,</v>

1460
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:24.494
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things we consume in the privilege </v>

1461
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 2>that we have depends on the suffering of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1462
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes us all like deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious on some even unspoken level.</v>

1463
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Even if you don't acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1464
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to have a kind of inner </v>

1465
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:35.240
<v Speaker 2>healing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to,</v>

1466
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:36.163
<v Speaker 2>we have to live in a world where our </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily actions are not creating misery </v>

1467
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:40.004
<v Speaker 2>and the rest of the world.</v>

1468
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:43.000
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd need to become conscious.</v>

1469
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:44.620
<v Speaker 1>We need to become awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to think,</v>

1470
00:59:44.621 --> 00:59:45.454
<v Speaker 1>how happy is that phone making me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How happy are these trainers making me </v>

1471
00:59:49.451 --> 00:59:51.880
<v Speaker 1>become aware?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be distracted.</v>

1472
00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't lose your connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connect to who you really are.</v>

1473
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Any books you weren't going to recommend</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

1474
00:59:58.301 --> 01:00:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Obviously your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called the divide,</v>

1475
01:00:00.521 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>a brief guide to global inequality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it solution brief a,</v>

1476
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1477
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>it's basically this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bangs right on.</v>

1478
01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many pages?</v>

1479
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 340.</v>

1480
01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that includes and notes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1481
01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.034
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to read those bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tear it out as soon as I </v>

1482
01:00:20.261 --> 01:00:21.910
<v Speaker 2>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole bit of the back.</v>

1483
01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing it right to a copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sign it for you.</v>

1484
01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to kiss it and touch it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cuddle it.</v>

1485
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would recommend,</v>

1486
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:32.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite thinkers in this </v>

1487
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.580
<v Speaker 2>field is a guy named todd.</v>

1490
01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Samaritans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd definitely recommend that people</v>

1491
01:00:43.301 --> 01:00:44.620
<v Speaker 2>read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name again?</v>
