14
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>another day in the death of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you,</v>

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>where the devices that just in one 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour period you,</v>

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I suppose elevate the depths that take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place on that day until their stories.</v>

17
00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Did you really just choose the day at </v>
<v Speaker 1>random?</v>

18
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first day I could do,</v>

19
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 2>London promoting a previous book in </v>
<v Speaker 2>October.</v>

21
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 2>And then I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a seven month old babies.</v>

22
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 2>How did a little bit of work to do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in the good graces of my family then</v>

23
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 2>it was thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.523
<v Speaker 2>my family is American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife is American and this was the </v>

25
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 2>first Saturday after thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the,</v>

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 2>it was literally the first challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 2>what's awful about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 2>shapes his book is the reliability of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the statistic.</v>

29
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 2>So every day in American seven kids on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average a shot dad.</v>

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And that statistic is sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable that so long as you're choosing</v>

31
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>a weekend cause more do done at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend or in a,</v>

32
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>and what more do die the weekend even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more dire in the summer when kids around</v>

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.620
<v Speaker 2>and playing and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

34
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 2>that you could do any weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>

35
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.033
<v Speaker 2>it would work horrifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could in the most brutal </v>

36
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.363
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sit down and wait for the kids </v>

37
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will donate.</v>

38
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 2>It's reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfectly reliable statistics.</v>

39
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the stance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can almost guarantee you that last</v>

40
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.433
<v Speaker 2>weekend on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven kids would have at least seven </v>

41
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:26.974
<v Speaker 2>kids would've died on Saturday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday and next weekend will be the </v>

42
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

43
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Why is he in particular about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths that goals you?</v>

44
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Why are you fascinated by this?</v>

45
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 2>It's more that they all go me and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

46
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>if America pays attention when it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass shooting or some kind of spectacle,</v>

47
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 2>not every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time,</v>

48
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.873
<v Speaker 2>but on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these deaths are just like the white </v>

49
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 2>noise around you that everybody gets on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

50
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>And you do almost in year two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

51
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching the TV and it's,</v>

52
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this,</v>

53
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 2>well before the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.803
<v Speaker 2>and on 68th and Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 17 year old boy was shot dead last </v>

55
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.871
<v Speaker 2>night when Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.704
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is a show of his mum </v>

57
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.110
<v Speaker 2>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying [inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.313
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while that just becomes the way </v>

59
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

60
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I do think in this center helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>British and thinking,</v>

61
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.824
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be like that </v>

62
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.603
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I wanted to do with this </v>

63
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>random day was pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the day pick the kids.</v>

64
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

65
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>if you pick a different day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a different book.</v>

66
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

67
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.723
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

68
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>twice a week a toddler either killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves or kill someone.</v>

69
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.474
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be other days it would be </v>

71
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:03.574
<v Speaker 2>more compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the order would produce more </v>

72
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:06.964
<v Speaker 2>compelling stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is this was like the day </v>

73
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.613
<v Speaker 2>choose the kids and then I will follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up and find out who they were </v>

74
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.850
<v Speaker 2>because they just statistics methodology</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the,</v>

75
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.150
<v Speaker 2>because it is random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you access to the horror of the</v>

76
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>randomness because it wasn't selected on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis of it being,</v>

77
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a compelling story.</v>

78
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.763
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you could spin a roulette</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel and that will land on a tie where </v>

79
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>there's devastation and unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

80
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

81
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.093
<v Speaker 2>and many of them are compelling Ansley </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them are compelling in their own </v>

82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.553
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was important to me was not to </v>

83
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 2>kind of game it in order to try and draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>out some,</v>

84
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to draw out a specific emotional </v>

85
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:55.954
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was also very determined and went </v>

86
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 2>back with some foods with my editor </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

87
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

88
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.723
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the order of the death should come in </v>

89
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 2>the order that they were shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like Hilda Story.</v>

90
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the best one here.</v>

91
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.374
<v Speaker 2>And so the first child to be shown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in in some ways the most terrific </v>

92
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>and there is a problem there for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a book,</v>

93
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>which is that you pick up the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

94
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you pick up this book.</v>

95
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 2>The first child is the youngest child is</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years old.</v>

96
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.583
<v Speaker 2>He answers the door and his mom's ex </v>
<v Speaker 2>lover shoots him in the head and then </v>

97
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 2>runs off and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>ends up getting shot by the cops </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

99
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And it's really the story of this kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mums,</v>

100
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.633
<v Speaker 2>unrelenting grief and her struggle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get back to some kind of normal </v>

101
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ordinarily you wouldn't w you know,</v>

102
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>people of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I read the first chapter and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had to put it down for a week,</v>

104
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

105
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

106
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the order in which they came,</v>

107
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>then that's the order in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.693
<v Speaker 2>they should be written if I was gaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out or put something a bit easier </v>

109
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.504
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

110
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.433
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.513
<v Speaker 1>So obviously what you're saying is true </v>
<v Speaker 1>is important to you and a kind of </v>

112
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>practical truth as I posted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of truths that emerge in</v>

113
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.450
<v Speaker 1>these times that are to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.333
<v Speaker 1>deliberate construction of stories to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engender a feeling that some people </v>

115
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>would argue even from an artistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

116
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily a journalistic </v>

117
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll know,</v>

118
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>it will be more true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>

120
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.781
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

121
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>if it ends in this climactic moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people,</v>

122
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got the kind of way that we were</v>

123
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.630
<v Speaker 1>asked as creative people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>compromise is usually a or regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

125
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It'll be easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

126
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately you want more people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>read the book.</v>

127
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.703
<v Speaker 1>So why did you have a kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an almost puritanical determination to </v>

128
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>commit to truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>

129
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>there is something a bit Brechtian in </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it in that sense of just kind of,</v>

130
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just here is I guess what I felt was </v>

131
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 1>how's that Brecht interests as well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of kind of,</v>

132
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:12.891
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.290
<v Speaker 1>not going to try and manipulate your own</v>

134
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 2>motions here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

135
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 2>although I mean the subject matter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional enough.</v>

136
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to engage your critically and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

137
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:27.594
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that this is what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do that I made a pitch for </v>

138
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.283
<v Speaker 2>Brett in book about China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't build the way that you </v>

139
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 2>described it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that sounded a bit like that I</v>

140
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 2>met kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

141
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand the stories are so </v>

142
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 2>horrific and I feel compelling in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own rights that,</v>

143
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

144
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.923
<v Speaker 2>that I'll need to be gamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that also there is some power in </v>

145
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.670
<v Speaker 2>saying this was the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was how the day progressed.</v>

146
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.060
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

147
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still my book.</v>

148
00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:15.030
<v Speaker 2>So there's still things I left out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I put in.</v>

149
00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:15.864
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I didn't edit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also not like I didn't desire response </v>

150
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:22.530
<v Speaker 2>from people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

151
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that the premise starts </v>

152
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:28.704
<v Speaker 2>with something random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to keep to keep honest to that </v>

153
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 2>as much as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.380
<v Speaker 2>as much as I possibly can.</v>

155
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I can see why you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

156
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:37.644
<v Speaker 1>very confronting idea just to say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>day happened and this is how the day </v>

157
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:43.500
<v Speaker 1>unfolded in the react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reality of that day.</v>

158
00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>So if you feel like that was a brew or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unbearable,</v>

159
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.410
<v Speaker 1>well that's simply the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at reality,</v>

160
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:54.411
<v Speaker 1>not the artistry of a creative person </v>
<v Speaker 1>with get you over interesting</v>

161
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.250
<v Speaker 2>position to analyze what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America with violence more broadly.</v>

162
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:02.424
<v Speaker 2>I read something that you wrote a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of days ago about what trump means in </v>

163
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 2>terms of hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

164
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>submerged ideas becoming explicit.</v>

165
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.423
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a relationship between the </v>

166
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 2>ideas you're exploring in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular book?</v>

167
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we seeing something that's important</v>

168
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.280
<v Speaker 2>and unique now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

169
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>do you think in America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we are.</v>

170
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

171
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 2>it's important to recognize that trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't invent racism or bigotry,</v>

172
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's button,</v>

173
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.843
<v Speaker 2>there's never been someone at such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level who's prepared to be so </v>

174
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.534
<v Speaker 2>brazen about their bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is new to have that lead from </v>

175
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

176
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:58.311
<v Speaker 2>you can have George Wallace in Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a segregationist running for president,</v>

177
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but nobody thought he was going to whip </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

178
00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:02.374
<v Speaker 2>It was a protest candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And instead you have trump going to </v>

179
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:09.981
<v Speaker 2>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which only removed at state ban on mixed</v>

180
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 2>most managers in two thousand two </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand.</v>

181
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

182
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking some serious kind of </v>

183
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Taliban Nael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

184
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing them going all right.</v>

185
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s um,</v>

186
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 2>trashing these black athletes who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

187
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.573
<v Speaker 2>are making a protest about black lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter now just they fill in the </v>

188
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:34.670
<v Speaker 2>listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

189
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.543
<v Speaker 2>this is the protest were nfl players are</v>
<v Speaker 2>kneeling during the national anthem </v>

190
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 2>because they're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this anthem don't include me.</v>

191
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea that this anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until he's handsome,</v>

192
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 2>represents the ideals of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not going to stand up for him.</v>

193
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

194
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and I guess relating that to the themes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the book,</v>

195
00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean most interesting in the book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the kids,</v>

196
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.760
<v Speaker 2>all of the shootings that we know of </v>
<v Speaker 2>same race,</v>

197
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 2>which is usually in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is segregated to death.</v>

198
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.870
<v Speaker 2>So white people kill white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people kill black people.</v>

199
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

200
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.873
<v Speaker 2>the term black on black violence doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean anything cause it's just violence </v>

201
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:20.720
<v Speaker 2>as how American violence works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

202
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and none of them are killed by cops.</v>

203
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.963
<v Speaker 2>But the date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the November the 23rd 2013 comes in </v>

204
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.270
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

205
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300
<v Speaker 2>when George Zimmerman is acquitted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting Trayvon Martin Dead in Florida,</v>

206
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 2>which was when the black lives matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag was coined and Ferguson,</v>

207
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.980
<v Speaker 2>which is when it really took off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Michael Brown is showing back up in</v>

208
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.173
<v Speaker 2>broad daylight and this and some Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it comes in between those and it </v>

209
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:54.364
<v Speaker 2>doesn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of the death conform to that kind </v>

210
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.154
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

211
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that morality play of white cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black kid.</v>

212
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:03.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are two ways in which it </v>

213
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.084
<v Speaker 2>relates to the broader theme in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first is the way that the police treat </v>

214
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 2>these deaths for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>

215
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of thing that you know,</v>

216
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 2>happens down there.</v>

217
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.220
<v Speaker 2>So they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few of the deaths are um,</v>

218
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.780
<v Speaker 2>solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

219
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.833
<v Speaker 2>very few of the murders are solved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the parents think that becomes </v>

220
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 2>on even trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing is the way that</v>

221
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 2>they're treated by the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

222
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 2>that's not news really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a kid gets killed down there,</v>

223
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 2>that's where kids get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

224
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't actually do this in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

225
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:46.714
<v Speaker 2>but develop this kind of notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsequently that when I went to </v>

226
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 2>journalism school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

227
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing when,</v>

228
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when dope by some man.</v>

229
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a story when a man bites </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>

230
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 2>that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you have to ask yourself,</v>

231
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.133
<v Speaker 2>why do these dogs keep buying people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why the same people keep getting </v>

232
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:06.124
<v Speaker 2>bitten and who controls these dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the fact that someone keeps </v>

233
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:09.544
<v Speaker 2>happening in a place is a reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate it and no reason to ignore </v>

234
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

235
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I suppose that the normalization</v>

236
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>is an important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxication.</v>

237
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 1>That this is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not question it.</v>

238
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that well known journalistic trope </v>

239
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.643
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a way of establishing what </v>

240
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 1>normal is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We surprised at what is acceptable.</v>

241
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.933
<v Speaker 1>I learned because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a part of it is that these podcasts </v>

242
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>of cancer to university now and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn more and uh,</v>

243
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I learned this thing about net crow </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

244
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:45.994
<v Speaker 1>like who it's okay to kill can and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose in the normalization of the </v>

245
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 1>deaths of these children in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular regions,</v>

246
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is what the more that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the state in that it doesn't matter.</v>

247
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:59.430
<v Speaker 1>You are indicating that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're continually broadcasting.</v>

248
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

249
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.980
<v Speaker 1>They're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

250
00:14:01.981 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>The black lives</v>

251
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.423
<v Speaker 2>don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are these assignments and </v>

252
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 2>these assumptions come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

253
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one boy in Dallas,</v>

254
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

255
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.553
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets just 80 words in the Dallas </v>

256
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Morning News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>saying that he was shot dead while he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was walking with his friend.</v>

258
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And then the first comment after this 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>words is this a woman saying,</v>

259
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to blame the victim.</v>

260
00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what exactly what she'd done.</v>

261
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

262
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where were the parents?</v>

267
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.203
<v Speaker 2>more questions and that the first thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that raises is what time should have </v>

271
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Side when they say he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an a student and it's like,</v>

272
00:14:56.181 --> 00:15:01.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately that a child wasn't doing </v>

274
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.790
<v Speaker 1>that well academically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

275
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

276
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 1>If only you just pulled his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.891
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

278
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>just trying to bet barry Algebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he'd still be alone.</v>

279
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big rights.</v>

280
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.233
<v Speaker 1>But then sneaking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman knows nothing about his </v>

281
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.884
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

282
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.013
<v Speaker 2>this family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not like they were </v>

283
00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go 80 words and you find out</v>

284
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:26.564
<v Speaker 2>that his mom knew exactly where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that night it had been with his </v>

285
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:31.364
<v Speaker 2>friend who was over because he was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his grounding to church the next </v>

286
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No word of a lie.</v>

287
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And this is why it's useful to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these other things where you're saying,</v>

288
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it just sounds so idealic.</v>

289
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They drank cocoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they watched,</v>

290
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 2>we're the millers and they played two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

291
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing that Samuel Brightman </v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

292
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>he's the kid who was shot that night was</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheat at now.</v>

293
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.483
<v Speaker 2>And he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very persistent cheetah who know by all </v>

294
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he decided to walk his friend,</v>

295
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 2>the six minutes bank to his granny's </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

296
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 2>And during that six minutes he was shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

297
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows why Samuel that only moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>that quite recently.</v>

298
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Some you didn't hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's quite a sweet,</v>

299
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 2>quite fragile kid actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

300
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>by every accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that knew him.</v>

301
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of kids in the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>where nobody says that about them.</v>

302
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

303
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you got this woman saying,</v>

304
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:30.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I blame the parents and you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

306
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know the parents.</v>

308
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.524
<v Speaker 2>But there is an assumption if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>black and working costs and you live in </v>

309
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 2>some of these areas that it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

310
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know anyone like that.</v>

311
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:46.803
<v Speaker 2>It's that they're kind of almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different species where the parents </v>

312
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:51.734
<v Speaker 2>don't love their kids and the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't love life and the pennants and </v>

313
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 2>negligent and the kids are feral.</v>

314
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.013
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it becomes permissible and </v>

315
00:16:58.211 --> 00:16:59.044
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I learned a few things they had like </v>

316
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.313
<v Speaker 1>the black lives matters is a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the assumption black lives </v>

317
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.510
<v Speaker 1>don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unstated blank lives don't ma'am.</v>

318
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:11.703
<v Speaker 1>I see also that your commitment to truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a requirement because what we're </v>

319
00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:16.474
<v Speaker 1>dealing with is the management of </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative in order to facilitate a </v>

320
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:20.854
<v Speaker 1>particular response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in a sense that the first comment </v>

321
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 1>after the iee word a eulogy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

322
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.870
<v Speaker 1>like that's almost like a reflex that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person had.</v>

323
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.943
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you say when a black person is </v>

324
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:35.080
<v Speaker 1>killed in that era?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

325
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.943
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where were the parents and it's </v>

326
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:37.440
<v Speaker 1>been late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't have a result of </v>

328
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.724
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in America when a trayvon Martin </v>

329
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.833
<v Speaker 1>was murdered and I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the sort of grammar of news is </v>

330
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>obvious gone an intensity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of,</v>

331
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:50.934
<v Speaker 1>you see the police cars you've seen over</v>
<v Speaker 1>at helicopter shot of a law and it also </v>

332
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 1>seems a bit like it's all merging into </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and gang.</v>

333
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Even if those words aren't explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>being said,</v>

334
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 1>because those tracks exist in my mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

335
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So all we need to do is far a few little</v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers and I'll go,</v>

336
00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably that kid was sort of a criminal</v>

337
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.101
<v Speaker 1>or some value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:09.934
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes effort to unpick my </v>

339
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:14.394
<v Speaker 1>conditioning is a why English person in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America having already been </v>

340
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinated before my arrival.</v>

341
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

342
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.850
<v Speaker 2>it takes everybody method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually even the email,</v>

343
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

344
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean different efforts with different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of people,</v>

345
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:26.864
<v Speaker 2>but the condition and the dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of hedge many of that </v>

346
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:35.561
<v Speaker 2>narrative is so strong that the parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the kids who die will say to you,</v>

347
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.620
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't been in trouble with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

348
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.573
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing is listing the </v>

349
00:18:42.771 --> 00:18:46.190
<v Speaker 2>reasons why he shouldn't have died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A high end listing.</v>

350
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:49.280
<v Speaker 2>The reasons why they charge shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have died every single,</v>

351
00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:50.114
<v Speaker 2>so there were 10 kids got shot dead that</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that 24 hour period and they </v>

352
00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:54.920
<v Speaker 2>weren't all black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven were black to Latino,</v>

353
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:57.980
<v Speaker 2>one wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single blank parent.</v>

354
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.870
<v Speaker 2>When you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you think this would happen?</v>

355
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Did you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.490
<v Speaker 2>was this on your radar to a person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all said,</v>

357
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:09.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

358
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

359
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samuel's mom and Samuel,</v>

360
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get in trouble in school or </v>

361
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:16.310
<v Speaker 2>anything and his mom said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

362
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it'd be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thought would be his brother.</v>

363
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data new Eric just said,</v>

364
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.373
<v Speaker 2>did not doing your job properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think that your kid could </v>

365
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:28.660
<v Speaker 2>be short in this city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just email you.</v>

366
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.180
<v Speaker 2>So there is this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did you call it?</v>

367
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Macro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>macro politics.</v>

368
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.413
<v Speaker 2>Politics is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just for the dominant forces </v>

369
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:43.670
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of who should be show a kind of</v>

370
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.453
<v Speaker 2>encompasses all of us are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I have two American kids and we </v>

371
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:55.100
<v Speaker 2>were living in America when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing his book.</v>

372
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you realize,</v>

373
00:19:58.251 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

374
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the fear I have for my child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking around with that too.</v>

375
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a weird thing in the reporting</v>

376
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:09.260
<v Speaker 2>of it cause people went on about </v>
<v Speaker 2>parenting.</v>

377
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.093
<v Speaker 2>So manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I saw it looking to see if there's </v>

378
00:20:12.561 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 2>any documentation about parenting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

379
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And I found out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

380
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.300
<v Speaker 2>this was a government study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that black dance,</v>

381
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

382
00:20:21.381 --> 00:20:24.680
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be single dads and any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other race,</v>

383
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 2>but secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're more likely to buy.</v>

384
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.720
<v Speaker 2>They've read to help their children with</v>
<v Speaker 2>homework,</v>

385
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

386
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.640
<v Speaker 2>have breakfast with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A whole range of things that black dads,</v>

387
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.580
<v Speaker 2>while they were least happy to live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother,</v>

388
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.690
<v Speaker 2>they were the most likely to do all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things with their kids.</v>

389
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.741
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

390
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:46.574
<v Speaker 2>that can't be true you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I'm looking at a range of black </v>

391
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.154
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now this is when I'm looking </v>

392
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find someone who's written </v>

394
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:59.680
<v Speaker 2>something to amend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

395
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:00.514
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you doing your black </v>

396
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:06.391
<v Speaker 2>that you do all those things and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of,</v>

397
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

398
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:09.723
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is so dominant that you just </v>

399
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

400
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously no,</v>

401
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

402
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.790
<v Speaker 1>it's more powerful than our own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Groucho Marx quote,</v>

403
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.740
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to believe me or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own eyes?</v>

404
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And that voice becomes so dominant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness,</v>

405
00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:29.370
<v Speaker 1>they use zips reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

406
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I see the importance of the device,</v>

407
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.323
<v Speaker 1>that truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the commitment of the simple </v>

408
00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:38.010
<v Speaker 1>truth expose these narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.450
<v Speaker 1>so a visceral Starlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an erv ethic,</v>

410
00:21:42.451 --> 00:21:46.770
<v Speaker 1>it reawakens asked from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalization of the death of children.</v>

411
00:21:46.771 --> 00:21:48.720
<v Speaker 1>So in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like older than a minute.</v>

412
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Children die in isn't a thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just isn't,</v>

413
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:51.724
<v Speaker 1>it's not an Aae word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bitchery and then just roll your eyes </v>

414
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:56.460
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be parental responsibility.</v>

415
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.443
<v Speaker 1>Now I can sort of see again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of parental responsibility and </v>

416
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:06.030
<v Speaker 1>incorporation of crime and stuff into </v>
<v Speaker 1>those stories is a way of enhancing both</v>

417
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:10.230
<v Speaker 1>the idea that these somehow culpability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the victim,</v>

418
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.093
<v Speaker 1>your responsible and that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that plays a big role in American </v>

419
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:16.140
<v Speaker 1>culture in that it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

420
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>this is an individualized culture.</v>

421
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.470
<v Speaker 1>If there's some terrible bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to you,</v>

422
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not because you're this color or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this economic class in trial.</v>

423
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have tried to be artist to not</v>

424
00:22:25.681 --> 00:22:26.550
<v Speaker 1>get shot and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:29.490
<v Speaker 1>so like in this all to be it a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>hue.</v>

426
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:30.563
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

427
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it's based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an actually,</v>

428
00:22:31.861 --> 00:22:36.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a sort of a vital fred in perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the defining fred of,</v>

429
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

430
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American ideology is individualism and </v>

431
00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:41.274
<v Speaker 1>personal culpability versus any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected collective or national </v>

432
00:22:44.611 --> 00:22:45.444
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's continually </v>

433
00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:47.304
<v Speaker 1>being eroded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How this gun culture participate in </v>

434
00:22:49.921 --> 00:22:50.760
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it like,</v>

435
00:22:50.761 --> 00:22:51.594
<v Speaker 1>given that you're a person who tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in the way that you do what you </v>

436
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.323
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an like we saw other people </v>

437
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:56.094
<v Speaker 1>just like guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this idea so a irresistible to </v>

438
00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:01.440
<v Speaker 1>American people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

439
00:23:01.441 --> 00:23:02.580
<v Speaker 1>why isn't it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

440
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:03.414
<v Speaker 1>like you see sort of like a Bama speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>after sandy hook or wherever and he's </v>

441
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:07.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh right,</v>

442
00:23:07.171 --> 00:23:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the day now where we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns anymore.</v>

443
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:10.891
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

444
00:23:10.891 --> 00:23:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this fall so powerful?</v>

445
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to their unconscious?</v>

446
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Which is which?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an excellent question.</v>

447
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.133
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

448
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I guess one of the best ways to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

449
00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:26.684
<v Speaker 2>and you touched on it there in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping into some core things about how </v>

450
00:23:30.531 --> 00:23:31.364
<v Speaker 2>America feels about itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got nothing to do with guns but </v>

451
00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:36.410
<v Speaker 2>work quite well with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

452
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I used to go to the NRA,</v>

453
00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I went through a couple of NRA </v>
<v Speaker 2>convention,</v>

454
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.330
<v Speaker 2>the National Rifle Association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the gun lobby.</v>

455
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the vibe?</v>

456
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>

457
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.660
<v Speaker 2>weird and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

458
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.803
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of 90% of the </v>

459
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more,</v>

460
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>although they're trying to push gums in </v>
<v Speaker 2>more in women's direction,</v>

461
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.604
<v Speaker 2>said lots of now pink guns and Nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you can carry your gun in </v>

462
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 2>and kind of ways to look pretty with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your gun and stuff like that.</v>

463
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

464
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.573
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of white guys and I almost kind of </v>

465
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 2>almost sexual relationship to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these weapons.</v>

466
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.603
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of the stroking them and they </v>

467
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.011
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:23.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

469
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pouring them basically.</v>

470
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 2>And I would really play up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>englishness in these things.</v>

471
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

472
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 2>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 2>it helps and second because it mitigates</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blackness,</v>

474
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.413
<v Speaker 2>but we throw me now and I'm down to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming out of your mouth from Steven </v>

475
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got puff Daddy,</v>

476
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at Puff Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hearing them.</v>

477
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.760
<v Speaker 2>If I could explain stevenage to then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

478
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 2>so everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

479
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can continue with your prejudices in</v>

480
00:25:06.821 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Essex to Steven Itching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

481
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and I signed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understand this,</v>

482
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain it to me.</v>

483
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>And to a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were off to the races.</v>

484
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you married?</v>

485
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.073
<v Speaker 2>Do you have children?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine someone broke into your house </v>

486
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.033
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to rape your wife and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill your children and take everything </v>

487
00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 2>that you worked for what you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

488
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.691
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

489
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wave a stick sticker them,</v>

490
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.353
<v Speaker 2>you're going to call the cops and wait </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the cops to come or you're going to </v>

491
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:41.890
<v Speaker 2>defend your family and defend what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've learned.</v>

492
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.430
<v Speaker 2>And so it speaks to kind of masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homestead,</v>

493
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small government individualism,</v>

494
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 2>a notion of kind of my being right </v>
<v Speaker 2>defend what's yours.</v>

495
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Now the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

496
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 2>there are several kinds of facts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradict that.</v>

497
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:00.704
<v Speaker 2>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people who are shot dead killed </v>

498
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondly,</v>

499
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.183
<v Speaker 2>you must often that you're much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be sheltered by someone you </v>

500
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:09.554
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did someone you'd done so well I should </v>

501
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 2>say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you married?</v>

502
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.701
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

503
00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:18.470
<v Speaker 2>watch out for your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

504
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

505
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survey evoke these very primal yes,</v>

506
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 2>things in the culture and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted with that,</v>

507
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 2>if you start talking about background </v>
<v Speaker 2>checks and um,</v>

508
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:37.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bamming semiautomatic weapons and stuff </v>

509
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:41.294
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not really a match for these basic </v>

510
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 2>ideas of American individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small government masculinity and so on.</v>

511
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.363
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about tinkering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think so they have a powerful </v>

512
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:57.531
<v Speaker 2>narrative that they can tap into and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun control people done.</v>

513
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.883
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't seem like it should </v>

514
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:01.764
<v Speaker 1>be important enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A national rifle association and he's </v>

515
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:05.664
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagined the English version and I </v>

516
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:07.244
<v Speaker 1>have just been a bunch of cases in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berber jackets hanging around in the </v>

517
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:10.914
<v Speaker 1>shyest that wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think affecting policy of </v>

518
00:27:13.221 --> 00:27:14.054
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we have our own sort of </v>

519
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 1>uniquely bizarre equivalent within some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>

520
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.873
<v Speaker 1>more to temik issue in our own culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I was struck by Gary there was </v>

521
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like it shows you the limits of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational mind,</v>

522
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.213
<v Speaker 1>which is curious when we live in what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pointedly a rationalistic of </v>

523
00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:30.014
<v Speaker 1>materialist culture that's based </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily it's least explicitly on </v>

524
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 1>economics that people's drives are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sourced from rationale.</v>

525
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.613
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you hit them with none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're most likely first to kill </v>

526
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>yourself or be killed by someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

527
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 1>So the best thing you can do if that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fear,</v>

528
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 1>if fear is your motivator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's do not have a gun.</v>

529
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just stay in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes they endorsed that go out.</v>

530
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.563
<v Speaker 1>But that is the ultimate solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just atrophy in a cupboard had the </v>

531
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 1>brilliant the solution wasting away in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>market space.</v>

532
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 1>So like it just shows you the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>again is irrelevant.</v>

533
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.173
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant because they must know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they must know they must have been </v>

534
00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:10.890
<v Speaker 1>hit with those stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

535
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Well they have</v>

536
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 2>and what what they do is they deflect </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to other things.</v>

537
00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:23.620
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about the hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam [inaudible].</v>

538
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.810
<v Speaker 2>That's where these things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

539
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is true,</v>

540
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:32.010
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to be shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who have guns in the house,</v>

541
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:32.844
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be shot than they basically </v>

542
00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:35.404
<v Speaker 2>deflect that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're talking about black people </v>

543
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.103
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was promoting my book in </v>

544
00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:42.980
<v Speaker 2>America on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.890
<v Speaker 2>it was a Conan Chow and one guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

546
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.240
<v Speaker 2>if you just took out a few cities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

547
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.680
<v Speaker 2>then that whole average would be kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>way lower.</v>

548
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.510
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

549
00:28:58.511 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 2>but if you took half few seasoned in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be America would do.</v>

550
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean America is a hot wallet take out </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

551
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.500
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>

552
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can get cars from where you're</v>

553
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 2>going to get your blues from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>

554
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes from,</v>

555
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:12.783
<v Speaker 1>so that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in its coded like that this is a </v>

556
00:29:15.281 --> 00:29:18.460
<v Speaker 1>get even mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is ghettoization happening.</v>

557
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.493
<v Speaker 1>Why that statistics and nation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded incorporates a [inaudible] oh </v>

558
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.433
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fortunately as white people that </v>

559
00:29:25.391 --> 00:29:27.670
<v Speaker 1>live in a suburban area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrelevant.</v>

560
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And that cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's facilitated by an individualistic</v>

561
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:32.261
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

562
00:29:32.261 --> 00:29:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Or an individualistic perspective of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

563
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself and your country,</v>

564
00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their country.</v>

565
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 1>So like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

566
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids are American.</v>

567
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So listen though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

568
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like everything in that national</v>

569
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 1>rifle connect a convention seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was primal,</v>

570
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sexual connection,</v>

571
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the idea of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of fear.</v>

572
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 1>So when we're talking about guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not really talking about guns,</v>

573
00:29:56.501 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about power and fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual energies,</v>

574
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Leighton impotence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of social breakdown,</v>

575
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 1>rampant individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

576
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.513
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to unravel because </v>

577
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard for people to get,</v>

578
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.083
<v Speaker 1>like I wonder what would literally app </v>
<v Speaker 1>like why is it that it's no president </v>

579
00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 1>can countenance or no government can </v>
<v Speaker 1>count and it's,</v>

580
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:19.414
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just doing this thing cause it's </v>

581
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:24.200
<v Speaker 1>playing with the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consequences.</v>

582
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

583
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.610
<v Speaker 2>There's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fatalism about it.</v>

584
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.020
<v Speaker 2>So when I asked every family that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke to,</v>

585
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.060
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I ask them open ended question,</v>

586
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.180
<v Speaker 2>none of them mentioned guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

587
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Because I figure in the book it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if your kid got run over,</v>

588
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well traffic,</v>

589
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.813
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to get rid of traffic cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine a world without </v>

590
00:30:52.221 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

591
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.373
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

592
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

593
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.553
<v Speaker 2>imagining the world without God thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned poverty that I mentioned </v>

594
00:31:00.661 --> 00:31:02.880
<v Speaker 2>racism because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's everywhere.</v>

595
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.093
<v Speaker 2>So kind of Ha you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to go with now parents or </v>

596
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 2>that Kid's dad or this is a rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

597
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:13.740
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of</v>

598
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

599
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.460
<v Speaker 2>bigger thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

600
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I also think that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

601
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns a big business and so there is,</v>

602
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.920
<v Speaker 2>that's what</v>

603
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.240
<v Speaker 1>they have to be bigger than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it?</v>

604
00:31:27.241 --> 00:31:28.074
<v Speaker 1>Cause like they're statistically give </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially is not enough to have that </v>

605
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 1>kind of potency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be serving something very,</v>

606
00:31:35.071 --> 00:31:35.904
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what you said there </v>

607
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 1>about the people can't imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just can't,</v>

608
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.143
<v Speaker 1>that's been taken off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we could moderate Shafiq </v>

609
00:31:45.271 --> 00:31:46.104
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we could moderate guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these ideas are excluded and we </v>

610
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>accept that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is reality.</v>

611
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.183
<v Speaker 1>And I think probably all of us are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that scale somewhere with what we can </v>

612
00:31:55.951 --> 00:31:56.784
<v Speaker 1>conceive of and how radical a change </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to countenance how </v>

613
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 1>beautiful the world we're prepared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

614
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.543
<v Speaker 1>None of us are willing to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so like what kind of conclusions </v>

615
00:32:09.331 --> 00:32:10.164
<v Speaker 1>does this lead you to in terms of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures and the way that power </v>

616
00:32:13.651 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 1>operates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sort of,</v>

617
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 1>if it seems literally unimaginable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know Afghans?</v>

618
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

619
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I miss as you suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can work for almost anything in any</v>

620
00:32:25.491 --> 00:32:30.491
<v Speaker 2>country that if you are able to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>swamp the field in a way,</v>

621
00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:33.230
<v Speaker 2>if you are able to kind of,</v>

622
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

623
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.213
<v Speaker 2>if you were able to remove something </v>
<v Speaker 2>from public discussion and remove it </v>

624
00:32:41.061 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 2>from public countenance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then um,</v>

625
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's no reason why I shouldn't </v>

626
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 2>go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of,</v>

627
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:53.354
<v Speaker 2>different example would be nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons are used to be quite involved </v>

628
00:32:57.021 --> 00:32:57.854
<v Speaker 2>with cmd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be on the National Council of </v>

629
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 2>CMV and I went away for kind of 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

630
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 2>15 years to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

631
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.064
<v Speaker 2>to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I came back and Coban and one </v>

632
00:33:05.761 --> 00:33:06.594
<v Speaker 2>of them he talked about getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried and I kind of thought have you </v>

633
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 2>still got tried and true domain is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to stop talking about it?</v>

634
00:33:13.961 --> 00:33:16.850
<v Speaker 2>It stopped being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just tell him it stopped being a</v>

635
00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:19.060
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

636
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

637
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:21.044
<v Speaker 2>how weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt we were supposed to be afraid of </v>

638
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 2>the like young men from the North West </v>
<v Speaker 2>with backpacks.</v>

639
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.403
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've got this kind of lumbering </v>

640
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 2>kind of weird who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are we supposed to be firing that?</v>

641
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But kind of it had been removed from </v>

642
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 2>discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd just kind of stop thinking.</v>

643
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And you were a president was ncn be </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a breast of these ideas.</v>

644
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a code to be,</v>

645
00:33:47.861 --> 00:33:52.020
<v Speaker 1>we you're talking to their mate was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we operate in,</v>

646
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:52.863
<v Speaker 1>in a time where the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have a master data and the </v>

647
00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:56.734
<v Speaker 1>historical knowledge of how public </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the public sphere </v>

648
00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:00.694
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they almost know you only got to </v>

649
00:34:02.341 --> 00:34:05.200
<v Speaker 1>manage this for a little bit of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to be cool.</v>

650
00:34:05.201 --> 00:34:06.034
<v Speaker 1>And I think an obvious and pertinent </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent example is grand felt and the </v>

651
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:11.830
<v Speaker 1>management of the deaths around the toes</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep,</v>

652
00:34:11.831 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 1>just keep distracting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk about,</v>

653
00:34:13.511 --> 00:34:14.344
<v Speaker 1>don't clarify any information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will dissipate as surely we'll know </v>

654
00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:20.800
<v Speaker 1>like one of those totemic events that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scars are national consciousness because</v>

655
00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's almost too perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sometimes happens.</v>

656
00:34:23.381 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I notice in current affairs were </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically many,</v>

657
00:34:26.201 --> 00:34:29.400
<v Speaker 1>many Fred's come together and there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>indelible connection to truth.</v>

658
00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

659
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this must be because we've long regarded</v>

660
00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:36.760
<v Speaker 1>poor people as dispensable and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been making terrible financial decisions</v>

661
00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and we'd be ignoring it and all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>social infrastructures,</v>

662
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.403
<v Speaker 1>a paper tigers and there's nothing set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to protect people and we actually </v>

663
00:34:43.091 --> 00:34:43.924
<v Speaker 1>don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to have to stare it </v>

664
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:46.570
<v Speaker 1>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in that,</v>

665
00:34:46.571 --> 00:34:49.270
<v Speaker 1>when that kind of emblematic event </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs,</v>

666
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of sense that just ride </v>
<v Speaker 1>this out,</v>

667
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.030
<v Speaker 1>they'll stop caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other stuff will happen in a while.</v>

668
00:34:55.031 --> 00:34:59.680
<v Speaker 1>This will seem like an obsolete concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trident replaced with a newer,</v>

669
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.810
<v Speaker 1>more novel kind of fear.</v>

670
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>

671
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean your point about Grunfeld cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

672
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I do remember thinking at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

673
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:11.563
<v Speaker 2>cause it happened a week after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>election and we count the election and </v>

674
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.353
<v Speaker 2>that effectively what had happened June </v>
<v Speaker 2>now election was that Labor had </v>

675
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.280
<v Speaker 2>introduced a series of ideas that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>once considered mainstream.</v>

676
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And actually in most of Europe are </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered mainstream,</v>

677
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:31.940
<v Speaker 2>barely had been removed from the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>square.</v>

678
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 2>We're going to tax rich people a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

679
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

680
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.003
<v Speaker 2>we've done and not have tuition fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which when I started at university </v>

681
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:40.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

682
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.893
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna move to a reality that we </v>

684
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 2>actually have within my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 2>living memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 48,</v>

686
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

688
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

689
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I made called austerity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was.</v>

690
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>And so there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when grenfell happened,</v>

691
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I do think there was a price for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put it,</v>

692
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.530
<v Speaker 2>that we've just had this moment.</v>

693
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 2>And then Graham felt happened and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kind of like,</v>

694
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of something that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

695
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.733
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that it was part of the </v>

696
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>constellation that kind of brought those</v>
<v Speaker 2>threads together.</v>

697
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

698
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw it in on social media where </v>

699
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 2>when things like this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a group of people kind of</v>

700
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 2>who I'm sympathetic too who want to draw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the border conclusions and say,</v>

701
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:35.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

702
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 2>this is part of something bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

703
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:37.854
<v Speaker 2>if it's nine 11 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's always a group of </v>

704
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.694
<v Speaker 2>people who seem to be more dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any case have the power of the media </v>

705
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:45.414
<v Speaker 2>behind them who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exploring this tragedy for play </v>

706
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 2>command.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop talking,</v>

707
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.880
<v Speaker 2>stop talking about all the serious stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and respect for the victims.</v>

708
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And they tried that on social media and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've grandfathered,</v>

709
00:36:57.661 --> 00:36:58.494
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>

710
00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

711
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly the time to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

712
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:04.860
<v Speaker 2>What else should we be talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do feel that,</v>

713
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

714
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corbyn made that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that um,</v>

715
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.760
<v Speaker 2>coming out of this election there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a price to go,</v>

716
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 2>there was a language for it and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were kind of achieved to me.</v>

717
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.553
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of those examples where </v>

718
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:23.641
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

720
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 2>they'll neighbor didn't win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

721
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:25.734
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually they won quite a lot of </v>

722
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:32.841
<v Speaker 2>arguments and they change the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and yes,</v>

723
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 2>they are not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.303
<v Speaker 2>they have not formed a government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's not pretend they didn't win </v>

725
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't change anything.</v>

726
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.100
<v Speaker 1>A slight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an identifiable disjunct because</v>

727
00:37:43.101 --> 00:37:43.934
<v Speaker 1>the sort of proceeding media noise was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much about condemnation and ridicule </v>

728
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.083
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that in the face of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a positive reaction in a </v>

729
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.104
<v Speaker 1>positive result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to demonstrate this fissure </v>

730
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.123
<v Speaker 1>that exists between this is the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are telling you and this is the </v>

731
00:38:01.161 --> 00:38:06.161
<v Speaker 1>reality you are experiencing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The efficacy of media in dead Indian and</v>

732
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.670
<v Speaker 1>a mosque in our own reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as you said,</v>

733
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

734
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.043
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even me as a person that I like to </v>

735
00:38:13.671 --> 00:38:13.971
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

736
00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm really up for change and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical ideas.</v>

737
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.383
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like a giddy school girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might get rid of this tuition fees </v>

738
00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.190
<v Speaker 1>go bloody hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

739
00:38:22.191 --> 00:38:23.420
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

740
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that free education,</v>

741
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.430
<v Speaker 1>he's already that the way that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>situated.</v>

742
00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Now what this suggests to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

743
00:38:29.801 --> 00:38:30.634
<v Speaker 1>and given that we sort of started off </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the way we tell stories </v>

744
00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>and you elected with your most book to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a commitment to truth,</v>

745
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 1>even if that costs you in a structural </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

746
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:42.311
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

747
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the best terrible death occurs too </v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

748
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

749
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.780
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I think that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring is the outcome.</v>

750
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

751
00:38:56.111 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>If we've got true for on our side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking,</v>

752
00:38:58.691 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>by which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:00.574
<v Speaker 1>collectivize breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerwall stopped telling me stories of </v>

754
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 1>the individual stop ignoring how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of the powerful ways,</v>

755
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 1>having a devastating effect on ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

756
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Stop separating from one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding reasons to hate each other.</v>

757
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.533
<v Speaker 1>They are how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we not able to tell these </v>

758
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>stories in an effective way if we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>true for now side.</v>

759
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Why is this dominant story continuing</v>

760
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.770
<v Speaker 2>dominate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

761
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there are a few reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably millions,</v>

762
00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:28.590
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

763
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.003
<v Speaker 2>pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fear sometimes we don't quite even </v>

764
00:39:32.281 --> 00:39:33.860
<v Speaker 2>believe those stories are sales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

765
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.020
<v Speaker 2>That we want things to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

766
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

767
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.680
<v Speaker 2>we don't know where the album we quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>atomized.</v>

768
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.280
<v Speaker 2>So there are these moments when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

769
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.623
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else has been seeing at the </v>

770
00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 2>telly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] tell me who else,</v>

771
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.410
<v Speaker 2>six months as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize.</v>

772
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.313
<v Speaker 2>So this is that moment jumie election </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was one of the questions times </v>

773
00:39:56.131 --> 00:39:56.964
<v Speaker 2>when a young woman says this discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about nuclear weapons and disarmament </v>

774
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:02.933
<v Speaker 2>and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering why so many people </v>

775
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:08.340
<v Speaker 2>want to bomb everyone and there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheer in the audience.</v>

776
00:40:08.341 --> 00:40:08.701
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

777
00:40:08.701 --> 00:40:09.630
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

778
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.450
<v Speaker 2>what are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we having that conversation?</v>

779
00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you want to Boehm.</v>

780
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And so there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

781
00:40:15.421 --> 00:40:17.470
<v Speaker 2>we all feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

782
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lack of confidence.</v>

783
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess Dennis is also true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are,</v>

784
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

785
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.000
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not withstanding social media,</v>

786
00:40:30.001 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 2>we don't run stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

787
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:38.031
<v Speaker 2>we don't own a large media corporations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

788
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.320
<v Speaker 2>We are still kind of quite marginal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of the means of distribution.</v>

789
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.400
<v Speaker 2>And then certainly in a country like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain or America,</v>

790
00:40:50.401 --> 00:40:55.401
<v Speaker 2>you have the kind of weight of this kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of awful history,</v>

791
00:40:55.561 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>which to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

792
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.960
<v Speaker 2>could damn the people within it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to talk honestly,</v>

793
00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:07.580
<v Speaker 2>say about British racism or about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>

794
00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:08.414
<v Speaker 2>then you'll have to talk about empire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and slavery and murder and a range of </v>

795
00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:15.780
<v Speaker 2>things that kind of people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicated him.</v>

796
00:41:15.781 --> 00:41:16.710
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

797
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

798
00:41:18.001 --> 00:41:19.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

799
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.143
<v Speaker 2>people will say we want a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even though they didn't fight or we </v>

800
00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 2>won the World Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they didn't play,</v>

801
00:41:29.221 --> 00:41:30.054
<v Speaker 2>but they'll never say we own slaves </v>
<v Speaker 2>stole stuff that just not going to do </v>

802
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to claim that.</v>

803
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.253
<v Speaker 2>And so having kind of honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations about who we are and what </v>

804
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 2>we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

805
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 2>people kind of shy away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in more powerful countries,</v>

806
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.460
<v Speaker 2>people kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

807
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.693
<v Speaker 2>the more honest conversation and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more truthful conversation is also kind </v>

808
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 2>of a more difficult conversation,</v>

809
00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.673
<v Speaker 1>put too much into our shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've allowed this to be a kind of a </v>

810
00:42:02.101 --> 00:42:05.250
<v Speaker 1>repository of truth where we don't look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

811
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.650
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what Britain mean.</v>

812
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So be careful when you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>

813
00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:12.600
<v Speaker 1>this is what freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we have done,</v>

814
00:42:12.601 --> 00:42:14.430
<v Speaker 1>this is what we missed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

815
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Like we've become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are many,</v>

816
00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:17.394
<v Speaker 1>many troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many unaddressed </v>

817
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:20.783
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our reality that I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a constructed reality is that we're </v>

818
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.350
<v Speaker 1>invited to participate in seem more </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactile,</v>

819
00:42:28.351 --> 00:42:33.090
<v Speaker 1>more attractive because we're a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unwillingness for us to embrace our,</v>

820
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of who we are culturally own.</v>

821
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I would have to argue who we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>individually that there's been,</v>

822
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:40.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a reluctance like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

823
00:42:40.021 --> 00:42:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I think Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is it like,</v>

824
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I hold these ideals,</v>

825
00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but if say like in a perhaps because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like it when people go me,</v>

826
00:42:48.091 --> 00:42:49.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you give up all your money?</v>

827
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Then I always think that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck off and leave me alone.</v>

828
00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Stop cutting me out of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

829
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.260
<v Speaker 1>My Leica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do some I think would it like,</v>

830
00:42:58.261 --> 00:42:58.891
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

831
00:42:58.891 --> 00:43:02.250
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are going to cut.</v>

832
00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who needs a house is can come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in my house.</v>

833
00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Now what's that gonna do to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>

834
00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:09.160
<v Speaker 1>What is my resistance to that idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easier?</v>

835
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.003
<v Speaker 1>A personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know I've got limited power as an </v>

836
00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:14.020
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is my unwillingness to commit.</v>

837
00:43:14.021 --> 00:43:14.470
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

838
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.200
<v Speaker 1>willingness to look at what in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

839
00:43:16.201 --> 00:43:18.660
<v Speaker 1>my own selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own capitalism,</v>

840
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.720
<v Speaker 1>my own love of comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own love of prejudge village,</v>

841
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.673
<v Speaker 1>my own prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own ways of garnering what I am and </v>

842
00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:28.320
<v Speaker 1>who I feel about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the participant.</v>

843
00:43:28.321 --> 00:43:29.154
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a participant in this system in </v>

844
00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:31.434
<v Speaker 1>these ways.</v>

845
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also kind of,</v>

846
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

847
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.790
<v Speaker 2>in a way we kind of have to keep those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two things in our head at the same time.</v>

848
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are,</v>

849
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.230
<v Speaker 2>we are people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are flawed individuals and we live in</v>

850
00:43:46.231 --> 00:43:48.150
<v Speaker 2>a capitalist society and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

851
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.440
<v Speaker 2>we want houses and we wants things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going at my,</v>

852
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.530
<v Speaker 2>my w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.410
<v Speaker 2>we want things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want comfort.</v>

854
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.143
<v Speaker 2>And my personal feeling about all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is do what you have to do so long </v>

855
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:04.690
<v Speaker 2>as you don't screw anybody else over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

856
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can point to a time or a place </v>

857
00:44:07.201 --> 00:44:08.910
<v Speaker 2>where I've actually done something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:14.190
<v Speaker 2>actually made somebody else poorer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse off than that's one thing.</v>

859
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.710
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

860
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you giving away your money doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>change capitalism.</v>

861
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you poorer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

862
00:44:22.021 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

863
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in changing the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in,</v>

864
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing you in,</v>

865
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

866
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.260
<v Speaker 2>seeing you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in poverty,</v>

867
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:32.423
<v Speaker 2>but also just kind of linking where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are as individuals to kind of more </v>

868
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:38.670
<v Speaker 2>collective things.</v>

869
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.113
<v Speaker 2>And this comes back to the gun thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually and and children in particular </v>

870
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:48.141
<v Speaker 2>that we talk about personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility a lot with guns,</v>

871
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:49.524
<v Speaker 2>but there is also with children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly a collective </v>

872
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have sexual services,</v>

873
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 2>child protection services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child courts,</v>

874
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.463
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an awareness that they're not </v>

875
00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:05.541
<v Speaker 2>fully responsible and so there is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>general way of understanding things.</v>

876
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:13.131
<v Speaker 2>I think that like I am not a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not a society.</v>

877
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people say,</v>

878
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:16.764
<v Speaker 2>well say someone did that to your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you want to just go out and </v>

879
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>murder them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

880
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:21.803
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm glad there's a code </v>

881
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.510
<v Speaker 2>because I know want to be responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for kind of,</v>

882
00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:28.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we respond to these things </v>

883
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 2>personally that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather,</v>

884
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:37.911
<v Speaker 2>there was some independent reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing these things and I guess,</v>

885
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have certain privileges.</v>

886
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.390
<v Speaker 2>We live in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have certain privileges,</v>

887
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.224
<v Speaker 2>so we have to be aware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't let us have them disable </v>

888
00:45:50.621 --> 00:45:51.454
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we learn from the particular </v>

889
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:54.804
<v Speaker 2>distinctions between these two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the studies of violence that you've </v>

890
00:45:57.511 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Speaker 2>undertaken in the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 2>England?</v>

891
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 2>What are the differences say about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries do you think?</v>

892
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

893
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 2>so I've been doing a series this year on</v>
<v Speaker 2>knife crime in Britain,</v>

894
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:11.800
<v Speaker 2>could be on the blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

895
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.980
<v Speaker 2>looking at tracking over deaths of kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 and under,</v>

896
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from um,</v>

897
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from stabbings and um,</v>

898
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 2>which kind of mirrors in a way what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening in the states.</v>

899
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the broad,</v>

900
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.343
<v Speaker 2>the broad lesson that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one can learn from path of those things </v>

901
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.303
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there are reasons why this </v>

902
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.694
<v Speaker 2>happens that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people kind of feel like this falls out </v>

903
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 2>of the blue sky or dark sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of,</v>

904
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it's evil.</v>

905
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

906
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.880
<v Speaker 2>bad people is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really,</v>

907
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America if you take segregation,</v>

908
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.830
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>

909
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 2>kind of underinvestment in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in communities,</v>

910
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:06.650
<v Speaker 2>and then you put on the top of that big </v>
<v Speaker 2>pile of tinder I violent weapon that can</v>

911
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:08.064
<v Speaker 2>kill people really easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think's going to happen in </v>

912
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Britain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

913
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 2>if you cut child and adolescent mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health services,</v>

914
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.220
<v Speaker 2>youth services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

915
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:21.740
<v Speaker 2>slash c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

916
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social services through kind of a local </v>

917
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.940
<v Speaker 2>councils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

918
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.130
<v Speaker 2>then what do you think is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

919
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.123
<v Speaker 2>Something's going to give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course it's going to be the </v>

920
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 2>poorest people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It we're to suffer.</v>

921
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>So there are a nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I s the last piece I did for the,</v>

922
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the blight series was an </v>

923
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:44.464
<v Speaker 2>interview with the mother of a child who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had killed someone who'd been sentenced </v>

924
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 2>and she had written to her mp saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please save my child.</v>

925
00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:00.390
<v Speaker 2>She had taken parenting courses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had told a local social services,</v>

926
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 2>either my child's going to be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this going to be a body bag.</v>

927
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 2>She had asked them to move her because </v>
<v Speaker 2>their child was struggling.</v>

928
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 2>She had tried all of this stuff and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said was,</v>

929
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 2>did my child did the local authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a knife in my child's hand.</v>

930
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Now he's responsible for what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't try everything I could.</v>

931
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where we found yes.</v>

932
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.213
<v Speaker 2>And it's possible to keep all of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in your head at one time that </v>

933
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 2>everybody has to take responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do.</v>

934
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And that includes us collectively as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

935
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:39.543
<v Speaker 1>I understand we've been overly biasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards narratives that are about </v>

936
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.353
<v Speaker 1>individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think we're so </v>

937
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.610
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to that idea is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in our own heads,</v>

938
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 1>we are individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems where people go,</v>

939
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well he did each and at that made you</v>

940
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:53.351
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

941
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:54.184
<v Speaker 1>oh I'm me and I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's immediately a sort of a fertile </v>

942
00:48:56.591 --> 00:48:59.790
<v Speaker 1>ground for that to flourish in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost,</v>

943
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:03.040
<v Speaker 1>it requires of us a little more work to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see us,</v>

944
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.933
<v Speaker 1>the invisible Fred's between us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective connections that our </v>

945
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 1>culture is made up of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that story is not articulated and</v>

946
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:14.260
<v Speaker 1>beautifully told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we forget it.</v>

947
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.273
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's almost like I feel like I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>return like [inaudible] to the my self </v>

948
00:49:19.271 --> 00:49:24.271
<v Speaker 1>as an individually driven on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of psychological memes,</v>

949
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're effective in my own Ed.</v>

950
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:29.973
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes an effort to feel like I'm </v>

951
00:49:31.841 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 1>connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of this and we are all one.</v>

952
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:35.734
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in a way we live in a culture </v>

953
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 1>that tells us the stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves that are the worst stories and</v>

954
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:44.350
<v Speaker 1>neglects to tell us the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

955
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

956
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics is one level of it,</v>

957
00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:48.491
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

958
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:51.610
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I wonder if there is more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just entropy or uh,</v>

959
00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:52.444
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inertia at work behind it because </v>

960
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:54.844
<v Speaker 1>it seems like such malice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it can this be as simple </v>

961
00:49:57.611 --> 00:49:58.444
<v Speaker 1>as the attainment of profit behind all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this suffering behind all of this </v>

962
00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 1>pain is just people going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

963
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:03.371
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

964
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:04.204
<v Speaker 1>It's better off to sell stuff if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're individuals and that </v>

965
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:07.114
<v Speaker 1>they've got buy things to feel better </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if their lives about it's their </v>

966
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:11.470
<v Speaker 1>fault that go after we will use.</v>

967
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

968
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more about neglect.</v>

969
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.750
<v Speaker 2>It's more about these going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black marks mammoth thing,</v>

970
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.590
<v Speaker 2>these people don't matter what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these people,</v>

971
00:50:25.591 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

972
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we can convince ourselves that </v>

973
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 2>these people don't matter and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamson doesn't matter,</v>

974
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.460
<v Speaker 2>then all sorts of things come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what this,</v>

975
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 2>what we've been trying to do beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blade and why I was so keen to interview</v>

976
00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.493
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother of the boy who killed was to </v>

977
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 2>make the point that in order to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

978
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 2>we have to humanize everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually,</v>

979
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 2>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a killer.</v>

980
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a child who killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a child who did something monstrous.</v>

981
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 2>He's not a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people are more than their crimes.</v>

982
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 2>That in a world where some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

983
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.730
<v Speaker 2>anybody in ms story isn't human.</v>

984
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of things are possible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglect,</v>

985
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.333
<v Speaker 2>to forget to dismiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have to start off from the </v>

986
00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 2>basis that even the people who are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we hate Nancy's,</v>

987
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.320
<v Speaker 2>we're humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that actually is the problem.</v>

988
00:51:24.321 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 2>What are they not human?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could plug that somewhere else that,</v>

989
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 2>that period and all of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods,</v>

990
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:32.640
<v Speaker 2>it was similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Armenian genocide.</v>

991
00:51:32.641 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were committed by human beings.</v>

992
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:37.363
<v Speaker 2>That's what scary about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we start pretending that they're </v>

993
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:44.300
<v Speaker 2>not human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we found a way to kind of um,</v>

994
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>park this stuff somewhere else.</v>

995
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.410
<v Speaker 2>So people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can do very bad things.</v>

996
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 2>They can also do brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful,</v>

997
00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:56.040
<v Speaker 2>beautiful things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

998
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way and,</v>

999
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then comes the problem of saying,</v>

1000
00:52:01.011 --> 00:52:01.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Mandela,</v>

1001
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:02.654
<v Speaker 2>he was a saint or saying that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing wonderful things and sanely now </v>

1002
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 2>the still they're people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're people.</v>

1003
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.780
<v Speaker 2>And that is a very inspiring notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it means it could be you,</v>

1004
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 2>it could be you doing that.</v>

1005
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1006
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.163
<v Speaker 1>I see the necessity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see now I understand your </v>

1007
00:52:19.031 --> 00:52:21.280
<v Speaker 1>commitment to truth because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>within truth.</v>

1008
00:52:21.281 --> 00:52:24.310
<v Speaker 1>There is complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the complexity though,</v>

1009
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.580
<v Speaker 1>there is a revelation if you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish off,</v>

1010
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you allow the threat to finish where </v>

1011
00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:30.604
<v Speaker 1>the conventional narrative ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are didn't your denying </v>

1012
00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:34.834
<v Speaker 1>yourself truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just beyond that is where the </v>

1013
00:52:36.491 --> 00:52:37.324
<v Speaker 1>explanation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you allow the story of it was this </v>

1014
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.470
<v Speaker 1>time of night in this community with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1015
00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:44.830
<v Speaker 1>within this demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are not participate in,</v>

1016
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:46.750
<v Speaker 1>in real truth there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood,</v>

1017
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I understand the importance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of that.</v>

1018
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I also recognize how important it is too</v>
<v Speaker 1>broad to firstly,</v>

1019
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify different stories.</v>

1020
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:58.811
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1021
00:52:58.811 --> 00:53:00.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another relatively recent,</v>

1022
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:02.080
<v Speaker 1>an interesting example where that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1023
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:02.973
<v Speaker 1>when was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was sort of the riots around that </v>

1024
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 1>police custody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder sort of around north London.</v>

1025
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That old though.</v>

1026
00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:10.144
<v Speaker 1>The peculiar way they sort of bloomed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of continuum of </v>

1027
00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:17.470
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was of regionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening what they do.</v>

1028
00:53:17.471 --> 00:53:20.380
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those disturbances?</v>

1029
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Well then no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far from,</v>

1030
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I live and um,</v>

1031
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I s I thought,</v>

1032
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:29.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1033
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young person has been killed and uh,</v>

1034
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 2>what kind of world would it be where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were angry about that?</v>

1035
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And you can try and manage the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the real way to kind of,</v>

1036
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two things that you have to do</v>

1037
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:47.154
<v Speaker 2>to actually confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is tell the truth about how </v>

1038
00:53:50.011 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 2>that happened to make sure somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>accountable.</v>

1039
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 2>And then the second is make sure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happens again.</v>

1040
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.100
<v Speaker 2>And anything short of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well one dissipate their anger,</v>

1041
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but people have a right to be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not least when people,</v>

1042
00:54:03.121 --> 00:54:03.954
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is this sense whether it's </v>

1043
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] or or something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1044
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 2>well that's not a way to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>saw that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1046
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:13.703
<v Speaker 2>writes a letter to your mp or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people feel that system has failed </v>

1047
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:22.521
<v Speaker 2>them and that it didn't just fail them </v>
<v Speaker 2>like our now you know,</v>

1048
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be another week before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1049
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my toilet's fixed.</v>

1050
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.310
<v Speaker 2>If found them in a way that meant </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody died,</v>

1051
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.773
<v Speaker 2>that it was existential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody died or in case of grant from </v>

1052
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:37.584
<v Speaker 2>loss of people dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then anger is a very least you can </v>

1053
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:43.850
<v Speaker 2>expense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1054
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is some sense for those people who</v>

1055
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 2>could never imagine that this could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1056
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.780
<v Speaker 2>that there is some sense of decorum </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing some sense of propriety.</v>

1057
00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:03.920
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always struck by remembering Michael</v>

1058
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Heseltine's pamphlet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you didn't see that coming.</v>

1059
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:11.871
<v Speaker 2>Did Michael Heseltine's report after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>IC one riots were,</v>

1060
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.033
<v Speaker 2>which was entitled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took her a riot and he's making the </v>

1061
00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:18.930
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1062
00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:23.931
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird that like what else would you have</v>

1063
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:25.104
<v Speaker 2>listened to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people have been saying all sorts </v>

1064
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 2>of things for all this amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing's happened.</v>

1065
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:32.784
<v Speaker 2>So what if not days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this was entirely his </v>

1066
00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:36.804
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it took this for you to pay </v>

1067
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:42.820
<v Speaker 2>attention and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1068
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 2>as society as to ask yourself when these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things blow up.</v>

1069
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

1070
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:49.644
<v Speaker 2>we have to kind of get back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to get beano Cole Cole's for </v>

1071
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:58.821
<v Speaker 2>calm cause it was cold for calm and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how come can you be when people are</v>

1072
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:00.054
<v Speaker 2>being shot dead in the street?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come can you be when people are </v>

1073
00:56:02.731 --> 00:56:03.564
<v Speaker 2>being made about the state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of piece existed before these </v>

1074
00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:10.980
<v Speaker 2>rise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've felt very peaceful,</v>

1075
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 2>but I don't feel peaceful if I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that my child to be one of those.</v>

1076
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.920
<v Speaker 2>And there is coming back to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is this sense from that,</v>

1077
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.940
<v Speaker 2>that letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman who kind of wrote,</v>

1078
00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:22.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to send me Brian died.</v>

1079
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 2>This could not be my child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could not be me.</v>

1080
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I cannot imagine I single way in a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which this could be me.</v>

1081
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 2>So this is happening to a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

1082
00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.813
<v Speaker 1>This is like in James Baldwins phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>about or at least analysis of the </v>

1083
00:56:38.781 --> 00:56:43.010
<v Speaker 1>creation of taxonomies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessary other that if you can have</v>

1084
00:56:43.011 --> 00:56:43.844
<v Speaker 1>a demonstrable you different and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully visually different other then </v>

1085
00:56:47.691 --> 00:56:48.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1086
00:56:48.591 --> 00:56:49.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm not culpable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it doesn't require such vivid </v>

1087
00:56:51.591 --> 00:56:52.424
<v Speaker 1>demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know the way that I think of </v>

1088
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.740
<v Speaker 1>people that are a rough sleepers as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1089
00:56:57.741 --> 00:56:59.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1090
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.580
<v Speaker 1>that couldn't be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1091
00:57:01.581 --> 00:57:02.414
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you recognize that these </v>

1092
00:57:03.471 --> 00:57:06.380
<v Speaker 1>distinctions are merely superficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

1093
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 1>veneers over the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly we are all vulnerable.</v>

1094
00:57:09.261 --> 00:57:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly it's all of our children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly we're all at risk.</v>

1095
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:12.733
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly change becomes an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity within which we must all </v>

1096
00:57:15.951 --> 00:57:18.890
<v Speaker 1>participate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really appreciate the way that you</v>

1097
00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:19.724
<v Speaker 1>tell stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you communicate for </v>

1098
00:57:21.081 --> 00:57:26.081
<v Speaker 1>aluminate in through truth ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may otherwise not have been revealed.</v>

1099
00:57:26.631 --> 00:57:27.464
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming on under the skin </v>

1100
00:57:28.911 --> 00:57:29.744
<v Speaker 1>mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for having me.</v>

1102

<v Speaker 1>Nice one.</v>

1103

1105
00:57:36.711 --> 00:57:37.544

<v Speaker 1>sometimes we ask people to recommend a </v>

1106
00:57:39.651 --> 00:57:42.230
<v Speaker 1>few books that we should read.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Naomi Klein,</v>

1109
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.420

<v Speaker 2>She's good.</v>

1110
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.820
<v Speaker 2>No is not enough.</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1113
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:58.860
<v Speaker 2>by Colson Whitehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a brilliant book about,</v>

1114
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a abolitionist.</v>

1115

1117
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1118
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:10.290
<v Speaker 2>which is really good if you've got kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the age of about four,</v>

1119

1122
00:58:21.901 --> 00:58:25.770
<v Speaker 2>of kind of Caribbean life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in amount of salaries.</v>
