<v Speaker 1>Under the skin is back a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that includes us all.</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.763
<v Speaker 1>A conversation where the old ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old divisions in the old categories </v>

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>of broken down where we listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the extremes</v>

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.823
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve a quality with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Annihilation of category is not </v>

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.553
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right where we hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>voices that have not been heard about </v>

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>clean and cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without Alabama,</v>

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't get trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were being coast.</v>

9
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:31.014
<v Speaker 1>We've been lubricated with where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite outsiders into the conversation </v>

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.203
<v Speaker 1>where we get thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orators philosophers from the left and </v>

11
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.194
<v Speaker 1>the right to collaborate or consensual </v>
<v Speaker 1>before reality is we can a new worlds </v>

12
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>from the ashes of the old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to miss this.</v>

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make you out to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The apocalypse is coming.</v>

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>We know that the time for pe tribalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

15
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.024
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to find a new amalgamation </v>

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Kendra from our consciousness and new </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm of peace and harmony,</v>

17
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>we must find among us a way to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great titans of tech,</v>

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>the silicon valley giants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that political rogues,</v>

19
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:10.764
<v Speaker 1>the great monsters of the cyber world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the corporate dragons or must be </v>

20
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.804
<v Speaker 1>slain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to find a David to fight this </v>

<v Speaker 1>Somehow we must load a single shot and </v>

22
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.444
<v Speaker 1>we can only find it collaboratively and </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and it will not be found on </v>

23
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will only be found under the skin.</v>
