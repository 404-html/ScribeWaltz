9

<v Speaker 1>on the subject of recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I have my very much as a philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course of these,</v>

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this excursion into the subcutaneous </v>

12
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.324
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've become friends and I'm very </v>

13
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.394
<v Speaker 1>grateful for you doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will now hand over full authority to </v>

14
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>you and bowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.873
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to begin by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've obviously read an advanced copy of </v>

16
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>your book and it was actually a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege privilege to read it and I was</v>

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>actually taken by a lot of the courage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you put down on the pages.</v>

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>So that to me is something to be deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>applauded.</v>

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I guess,</v>

20
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

21
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess kind of humbled that yachty </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall trust in me to do this.</v>

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.853
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you and thank you for our </v>

23
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something with,</v>

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cherishing.</v>

25
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to go,</v>

26
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly into this question.</v>

27
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:14.791
<v Speaker 1>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

28
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting being on the other side</v>

29
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>of this and the one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I kind of think about,</v>

30
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that for anybody who writes a book,</v>

31
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>they know that it's a whole series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastination.</v>

32
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it takes months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often it takes years.</v>

33
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.353
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the first thing that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck me was what compelled you to </v>

34
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>write this book at this particular point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life?</v>

35
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I felt that anybody that's in recovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has this experience where,</v>

36
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>what begins is something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using to tackle a particular addiction.</v>

37
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>

38
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>crack and heroin becomes sort of over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

39
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.143
<v Speaker 1>Like I realized that the tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques I was using to one day at a </v>

40
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.374
<v Speaker 1>time not used drugs and alcohol were </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming utilized in every area of my </v>

41
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that I feel about sex,</v>

42
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>the way that I feel about food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all behavior and all forms of attachment</v>

43
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>can be tackled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least my perception of them can be</v>

44
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>ordered by working the 12 steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So excuse me,</v>

45
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>coffee mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so what I felt was like this,</v>

46
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm like at this point in my life where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've gone through so many </v>

47
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>layers of disillusionment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusionment with fame,</v>

48
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.423
<v Speaker 1>disillusionment with Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this illusion when the sex and </v>

49
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:28.764
<v Speaker 1>disillusionment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think by and large are bloody good </v>

50
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to be illusioned?</v>

51
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so you know,</v>

52
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I felt like,</v>

53
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

54
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:37.814
<v Speaker 1>the recovery is the lens through which I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live my life is that my relationship is </v>

55
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>conducted through the program that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>described in this book.</v>

56
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Obviously my spiritual development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that I relate to other people,</v>

57
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.033
<v Speaker 1>I by no means do it perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a technique that makes it so </v>

58
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.474
<v Speaker 1>effective that I want you to expound it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen it change lives of </v>

59
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>people with really serious chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency,</v>

60
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>really serious behavioral problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a technique that offers</v>

61
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of counterweight to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overriding,</v>

62
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology of our time,</v>

63
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>which just seems to me to be a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined an icon and yeah,</v>

64
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.380
<v Speaker 2>conscious self centeredness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

66
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.753
<v Speaker 2>when I was reading the manuscript and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this call for transformation really </v>

67
00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:26.060
<v Speaker 2>comes through then you can see that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very personal journey that you go on.</v>

68
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was trying to figure out,</v>

69
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.563
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what type of book it actually was and I </v>

70
00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:34.220
<v Speaker 2>know this is bloody ironic or come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a song called postmodernist right there.</v>

71
00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to label it and classify it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

72
00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:37.814
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an affirmative way it's almost like </v>

73
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:40.064
<v Speaker 2>an anti self help book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what I of mean by this is I </v>

74
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:46.190
<v Speaker 2>think the central message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really jumps off the pages is that</v>

75
00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it's precisely these kinds of traits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a self centered,</v>

76
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.820
<v Speaker 2>individualistic kind of fuck the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and all,</v>

77
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:53.654
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of loving sentiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of gets us into this fix in </v>

78
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:56.414
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of just help yourself </v>

79
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.393
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what really to me comes out </v>

80
00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:05.141
<v Speaker 2>of this is more about a sober in perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>more truthful cry for human connection.</v>

81
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that where you see the hope?</v>

82
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think our culture and our </v>

83
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:15.821
<v Speaker 1>biochemistry collude to create a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chronic individualism.</v>

84
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that the natural conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

85
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a secular rejection of the </v>

86
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>mystical leads us to the conclusion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are just individuals.</v>

87
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>We're here to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here to fulfill our impulses.</v>

88
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>In the original 12 step literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says like,</v>

89
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>we have no argument with those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that say perhaps man's purpose is simply</v>

90
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:42.980
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill these bike camp by a chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives to procreate,</v>

91
00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 1>to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dominate the selfish gene approach.</v>

92
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.313
<v Speaker 1>But he says one thing we are certain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>is no one has made a worse mess of this </v>

93
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>way of life than we'd at suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism and addiction.</v>

94
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.383
<v Speaker 1>And like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I tried to live my life as a means </v>

95
00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:03.641
<v Speaker 1>to find personal fulfillment are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>into sort of a kind of peculiar despair,</v>

96
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I start to feel lonely.</v>

97
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.583
<v Speaker 1>I start to feel disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That don't mean I don't pick up the </v>

98
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>cudgel once again and try to find my way</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to false prophet.</v>

99
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Why I feel qualified to write a book on </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

100
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:16.340
<v Speaker 1>He's because I've been addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin.</v>

101
00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been addicted to crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been addicted to fame,</v>

102
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

103
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's approval.</v>

104
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:26.291
<v Speaker 1>I see this phenomena emerge again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and I'm starting to think that the</v>

105
00:05:26.781 --> 00:05:30.680
<v Speaker 1>label of addiction in itself is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>confining.</v>

106
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 1>That actually this is the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition in motion.</v>

107
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You're yearning itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yearning and we live in a culture.</v>

108
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.534
<v Speaker 1>I think that usually does is fuel this </v>
<v Speaker 1>will to acquire a know like I thought </v>

109
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.983
<v Speaker 1>it's become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I wrote the book is because </v>

110
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:49.874
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that simple though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an particular though is in </v>

111
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It entailed within,</v>

112
00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:56.804
<v Speaker 1>it are tools that could people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective in quite a profound way and </v>

113
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>what you say there brad about it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you from a point of view of going,</v>

114
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only I can get this when I get that,</v>

115
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll be cool.</v>

116
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Or if that person understood me or if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have sex with that person or if I </v>

117
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:11.414
<v Speaker 1>could get those shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these part being personal </v>

118
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:13.814
<v Speaker 1>examples from my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone be okay and it doesn't </v>

119
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.400
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I go like,</v>

120
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it enough because I'm </v>

121
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I every day I wake up,</v>

122
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.233
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bewitched and hypnotized by individual </v>

123
00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:25.944
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'd go and spend time helping </v>

124
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.244
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in real blatant sub Princess </v>

125
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.143
<v Speaker 1>Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why he's like going into a homeless </v>

126
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>shelter and getting proper hands on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being amongst it.</v>

127
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.493
<v Speaker 1>Or if just on a basic communal way like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we human being should be taking phone </v>

128
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 1>calls from other people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

129
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>reaching out and talking about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems for a change,</v>

130
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>which you know is odd that it needed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be full made for me to understand it.</v>

131
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm sure a lot of people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody do it naturally,</v>

132
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 1>but it just gives me a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to my mates if my mates are </v>

133
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 1>going through relationship struggles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal struggles or work struggles,</v>

134
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh why?</v>

135
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is good cause I can connect to you </v>

136
00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.474
<v Speaker 1>here and while I'm talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be thinking about myself and my </v>

137
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more I do it,</v>

138
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

139
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Christianity Brad had la,</v>

140
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what you think about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

141
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it talks about when Christ says</v>

142
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get down with a poor,</v>

143
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that's where he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like,</v>

144
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.344
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the scars and lesions and like </v>

145
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>there's some energy there when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping others and the Chi.</v>

146
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people that help others are </v>

147
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:23.834
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start to feel a kind of elevated </v>

148
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>sense of connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

149
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>meaning all of these words that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think being increasingly marginalized,</v>

150
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that are being excluded</v>

151
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.854
<v Speaker 1>from the sort of political ideologies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time and the social ideologies of </v>

152
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:44.860
<v Speaker 1>our time suddenly become accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit as most basic thing.</v>

153
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

154
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 2>There's an interesting point in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

156
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all kind of know in our </v>

157
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:53.260
<v Speaker 2>lives when human connections seem deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful to us,</v>

158
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that these connections exist</v>

159
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.313
<v Speaker 2>and we thrive on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know that they're kind of really </v>

160
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal because they're based on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical understanding and,</v>

161
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.883
<v Speaker 2>and that idea of love with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we often driven actually two </v>

162
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as you say,</v>

163
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.533
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to seek affirmation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong places and they become very toxic </v>

164
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:11.494
<v Speaker 2>and they become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes society can actually </v>

165
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>promote those types of relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we know what actually deeply,</v>

166
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detrimental to ourselves,</v>

167
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>to our emotional wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toward intellectual wellbeing.</v>

168
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.683
<v Speaker 2>And yet we still strive for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though we know they are </v>

169
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 2>completely empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless,</v>

170
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 2>or indeed maybe be nihilistic in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our own sense of self.</v>

171
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:30.814
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>

172
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>that'd be romanticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that we're at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>romanticism is a mendacious idea,</v>

174
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:35.431
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

175
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>the notion that you can find fulfillment</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being with some aspirational figure,</v>

176
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Speaker 1>some dietary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm living God as your own personal.</v>

177
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find salvation if I find them.</v>

178
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that idea,</v>

179
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:47.494
<v Speaker 1>I think he's highly prevalent but even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more toxic than this I think is the </v>

180
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.990
<v Speaker 1>commodification of relationships that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens on quiet the,</v>

181
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collusion between bio,</v>

182
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.344
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very natural I think on some </v>

183
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>level to meet a man and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can this man do for me?</v>

184
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Can he serve me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can he make me feel better?</v>

185
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.333
<v Speaker 1>Can I make money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is you're going to be a good ally in a </v>

186
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I do with it?</v>

187
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.113
<v Speaker 1>Or in my case with women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to have sexual intercourse </v>

188
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>with that woman?</v>

189
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Is this person gonna make me feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

190
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:17.574
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is the commodification and the </v>

191
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>objectification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

192
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 1>In my case it happened quite quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically.</v>

193
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I have to work to not approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship in that way.</v>

194
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me the program is the antidote to</v>

195
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>the type of thinking to which I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency that's all it addiction is,</v>

196
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>is a tendency left on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will go that way unless I intervene.</v>

197
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Unless there is a program and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing breath,</v>

198
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:42.534
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be important is we </v>

199
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>don't choose between a program and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

200
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We have a program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the program of your family,</v>

201
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>you have the program of your society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the program of your culture,</v>

202
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you have the program of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't undo that program,</v>

203
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>if you do not be code yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone leaving a cult,</v>

204
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>then that's the program you're living </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the program of I'm not good enough.</v>

205
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll never be good enough unless I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>this object or that object.</v>

206
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I won't be good enough on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person can accept me.</v>

207
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.703
<v Speaker 1>Now what I think this offers because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was designed to tackle alcoholism and </v>

208
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>addiction is a way of untangling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strands that web os to materialism,</v>

209
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>consumerism and objectification and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism.</v>

210
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>All of these things that are based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that what can be measured,</v>

211
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>what can be white is what is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See like my um,</v>

212
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I am anti atheist in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive,</v>

213
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know loads of people.</v>

214
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.313
<v Speaker 1>There are a few is probably you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are fantastic and incredibly smart </v>

215
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:37.314
<v Speaker 1>and compassionate and wonderful people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My concern is that there's a thread </v>

216
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.034
<v Speaker 1>within atheism that tells you that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that matters is that </v>

217
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:46.610
<v Speaker 1>which can be ascertained and science in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

218
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.463
<v Speaker 1>in all of its main disciplines is </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever peripheral forever on the brink </v>

219
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 1>of new discoveries.</v>

220
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.213
<v Speaker 1>And when you get someone like Elon Musk </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying by like look with the kind of </v>

221
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality technologies we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

222
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:00.204
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of proving that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>all currently living in a virtual </v>

223
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:05.030
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a gun,</v>

224
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.903
<v Speaker 1>my mates virtual reality thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little mate Israel is only 11 years </v>

225
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 1>old and a four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

226
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>you can be immersed now in a totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different reality.</v>

227
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>So we elon musk sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can do that,</v>

228
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>imagine what other cultures could </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably do.</v>

229
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>You can't rule out the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one.</v>

230
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody hell,</v>

231
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what it says in the bag of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gita,</v>

232
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.350
<v Speaker 1>except it doesn't use the word computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

233
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>like what is it that you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:30.084
<v Speaker 1>now we're saying it's the material world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an illusion that's like it's </v>

235
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 1>transmitted into your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the senses.</v>

236
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.873
<v Speaker 1>You reconfigure it and you end and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflections of your culture denote what </v>

237
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:40.644
<v Speaker 1>meaning you attribute to the external </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimuli and the only way of decoding </v>

238
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.114
<v Speaker 1>that I think we're not the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a way of decoding that is by </v>

239
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>impersonal set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In personal crisis,</v>

240
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you get the opportunity to reevaluate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that crisis could be divorce,</v>

241
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.423
<v Speaker 1>it could be drug addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be a heartbreak or some other </v>

242
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're at that point,</v>

243
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>whether as an individual or as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

244
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.463
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the kind of life I want to </v>

245
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 1>believe that I want to live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe it could be different?</v>

246
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.223
<v Speaker 1>Am I willing to accept help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you take those are the first three </v>

247
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you take those three steps,</v>

248
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to have transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

249
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a process of inventorying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a willingness to change,</v>

250
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and then a devotion to conscious contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to service,</v>

251
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way of life</v>

252
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.750
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

253
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.571
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:26.340
<v Speaker 2>this reevaluation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an I,</v>

256
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 2>it strikes me as a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

257
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:30.054
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a very difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to reevaluate everything about </v>

258
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.700
<v Speaker 2>your own sense of self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sense of behavior.</v>

259
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.743
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often easier to project your </v>

260
00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 2>troubles onto other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or are they,</v>

261
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>rather than actually saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

262
00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:42.360
<v Speaker 2>is this something about my own self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I needed to,</v>

263
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

264
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.943
<v Speaker 2>how am I shamefully compromising with </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in a way that's affecting my own </v>

265
00:12:46.921 --> 00:12:47.754
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectifying things datafication and so </v>

266
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wanted to bring us onto the,</v>

267
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 2>with the step that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 2>because I think when I was reading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

269
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the first kind of couple of chapters was</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

270
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go with this.</v>

271
00:12:58.041 --> 00:12:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

272
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.651
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:12:58.651 --> 00:13:00.390
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this step around,</v>

274
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:01.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit you have a problem,</v>

275
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.070
<v Speaker 2>then go and speak with somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you go into this section.</v>

276
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.053
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to do is write an </v>

277
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 2>inventory of all the things which really</v>
<v Speaker 2>piss you off,</v>

278
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I go,</v>

279
00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

280
00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:10.944
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where it's starting to get </v>

281
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:12.541
<v Speaker 2>challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

282
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to start to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

283
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.993
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you even say those words at the </v>

284
00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:16.051
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

285
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:16.321
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 2>this is not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

287
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.900
<v Speaker 2>This is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

288
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.110
<v Speaker 2>and you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.023
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write down all those things which you </v>

290
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:25.080
<v Speaker 2>think create a s and you're an assault </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your sense of Salford,</v>

291
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.123
<v Speaker 2>on your sense of dignity and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the phrase you actually use you as </v>

292
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>the uncomfortable confrontations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

293
00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>So deal with this uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontations in your life.</v>

294
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 2>And I was wondering how did you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>

295
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.723
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from writing the book because in many </v>

296
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:44.760
<v Speaker 2>senses you must have had to revisit a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of uncomfortable confrontations,</v>

297
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>which you'd already might've kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with.</v>

298
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.720
<v Speaker 2>But in writing the book there was almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an attempt to kind of revisit those</v>

299
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

300
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.070
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel right in this book</v>

301
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.660
<v Speaker 1>because of the efficacy of the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>

302
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.703
<v Speaker 1>it did not feel like the resurrection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cadavers of my past because they </v>

303
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>have been buried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in examine them,</v>

304
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 1>this metaphor is going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the purposes,</v>

305
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>for the purpose of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

306
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:16.020
<v Speaker 1>it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

307
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they don't bring him back to life now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

308
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:19.864
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a propensity to return to states </v>

309
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>of shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I like that I have that in me is easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered in me is easily triggered like</v>

311
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:28.774
<v Speaker 1>leading up to my wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cause I think like is the way I </v>

312
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 1>sort of have been explaining this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might like it,</v>

313
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mate Matt Morgan,</v>

314
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Speaker 1>he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps climbing up high.</v>

315
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.313
<v Speaker 1>We went down crime up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll fall on your head or smash open </v>

316
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:43.871
<v Speaker 1>like an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

317
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And ever since Matt said that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

318
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>a cutlet and keeps going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

319
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>My head or smash like an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Matt said the image is too lurid for</v>

320
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the child about our handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>like it's too potent an image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

322
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>So me getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think,</v>

323
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting married in the morning,</v>

324
00:14:58.521 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>like standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way I think,</v>

325
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>well what is marriage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marriage is a ceremony.</v>

326
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:02.714
<v Speaker 1>This is a ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about the relinquishing of the </v>

327
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about coming together and making</v>

328
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 1>a vow to become a different man and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in alignment with new principals.</v>

329
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 1>So on the causes that I'm looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

330
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently accidentally,</v>

331
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:15.674
<v Speaker 1>we've not consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow actually looking at what is </v>

332
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:18.734
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of a marriage in juice is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state in me that's the point of ritual </v>

333
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>to induce a particular state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meredith says,</v>

334
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>my friend Meredith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

335
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>people think that religion is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

336
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.433
<v Speaker 1>It is about the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you can't </v>

337
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:33.074
<v Speaker 1>understand the Latin mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better to just hear a lot of babbling </v>

338
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 1>and something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this guy talking about?</v>

339
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

340
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure some people identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

341
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.383
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the ritual induced the state </v>

342
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 1>in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear was so terrible.</v>

343
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 1>The fear was so terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>

344
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.713
<v Speaker 1>of what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had to use this program to cope </v>

345
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>with the level of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about getting married the next</v>

346
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.723
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not any fear about marrying my wife </v>

347
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>cause I really wanted and really wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

348
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>But something about that ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ceremony,</v>

349
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it meant something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't nothing.</v>

350
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

351
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I turn up at Church and then a party.</v>

352
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

353
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:09.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

354
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends,</v>

355
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 1>there is the unseen.</v>

356
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 1>There is the invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

357
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.823
<v Speaker 1>there is something happened to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to surrender 100% I had to </v>

358
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

359
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>what is this fear trying to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the field one,</v>

360
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the fear is communicate in the fear is </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to me from my own biochemistry,</v>

361
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>for my own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our own consciousness,</v>

362
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerful message is being said sin.</v>

363
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.640
<v Speaker 1>And if I don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something bad is gonna happen to me.</v>

364
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I surrendered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I surrendered wholeheartedly.</v>

365
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And every time I do that in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>improves.</v>

366
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:40.094
<v Speaker 1>New States of consciousness are achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the surrendering of these </v>

367
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 1>biochemical circuits that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>containers these neurological loops that</v>

368
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 1>we Lao to encircle us and tether us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>low states of consciousness.</v>

369
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I think you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

370
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm those familiar.</v>

371
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.363
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the of this new state of </v>

372
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:59.210
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to connect with,</v>

373
00:16:59.211 --> 00:16:59.250
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

374
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.980
<v Speaker 2>back to a question of philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

375
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

376
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.163
<v Speaker 2>the trouble is with this bloody critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories as we can't read any book </v>

377
00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:06.834
<v Speaker 2>without actually looking for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political and philosophical </v>

378
00:17:08.071 --> 00:17:08.880
<v Speaker 2>implications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

379
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.391
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

380
00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:09.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

381
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read Alice in wonderland,</v>

382
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:11.864
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the best bloody book of </v>

383
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.320
<v Speaker 2>political theory ever written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

384
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 2>But often we read books and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

385
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.703
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are just devoid of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant philosophical significance </v>

386
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:21.660
<v Speaker 2>or implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

387
00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:24.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't force you to think about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem differently right.</v>

388
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.133
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing which I admired about the </v>

389
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:30.300
<v Speaker 2>book was it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually has a very deep political,</v>

390
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:33.060
<v Speaker 2>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical architecture to it.</v>

391
00:17:33.061 --> 00:17:36.540
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing which I was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>struck with the book and what I was kind</v>

392
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:37.374
<v Speaker 2>of excited when I was reading with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you talk about this attempt to </v>

393
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:43.050
<v Speaker 2>connect about connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also link it to the question.</v>

394
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:43.471
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

395
00:17:43.471 --> 00:17:44.304
<v Speaker 2>life is very fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is short and we need to find these </v>

396
00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>connections and a meaningful existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I what the book really</v>

397
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 1>kind of finds almost like a rescue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me is an attempt to introduce </v>

398
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:56.034
<v Speaker 1>something of the substantive over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial and the substantive for you </v>

399
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:00.384
<v Speaker 1>is spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering how you can kind of </v>

400
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:03.324
<v Speaker 1>maybe riff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 1>talk maybe a bit more about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

402
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.593
<v Speaker 1>what is it about the spiritual that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantive for you in terms of dealing </v>

403
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:11.034
<v Speaker 1>precisely with maybe the philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book or is it a standard about the </v>

404
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 1>spiritual to me is its efficacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works when I do these things,</v>

405
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel better when I am kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm loving,</v>

406
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 1>when I surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>

407
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Now these things can't be measured mack </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mechanized or monetize,</v>

408
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.893
<v Speaker 1>but they are in fact in fact effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some truth in them that is </v>

409
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 1>difficult to legislate or iterate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

410
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think perhaps the reason that this</v>

411
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 1>program is so good is I didn't invent </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

412
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It was invented or constructed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>

413
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 for easy in America,</v>

414
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:47.304
<v Speaker 1>a chronic alcoholic bill Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who after like an incredible source of </v>

415
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 1>an epic drinking binge or the type which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are defined his life,</v>

416
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.793
<v Speaker 1>had what he described as an epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe epiphany to be the </v>

417
00:18:59.041 --> 00:18:59.874
<v Speaker 1>revelation of essence that previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>concealed revelation of essence would </v>

418
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 1>want to feel this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

419
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.593
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why and bill was an has this </v>

420
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.004
<v Speaker 1>epiphany and realize is that he will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never be able to be free from drink and </v>

421
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:15.774
<v Speaker 1>the problems that result from it unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>he helps other people to not even </v>

422
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>realize he's one he can never drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>again one day at a time too.</v>

423
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.203
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have to help other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have the same problem in order to </v>

424
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 1>achieve this state and set about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

425
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling drunks in New York,</v>

426
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.150
<v Speaker 1>going up to people in bars going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me help you,</v>

427
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 1>let me help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then predictably saying,</v>

428
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get off and leave me alone.</v>

429
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Then eventually it has this sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

430
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an experience which in the myth of the </v>

431
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:47.160
<v Speaker 1>foundation of alcoholics anonymous is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the significant moment,</v>

432
00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the defining moment in their conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

433
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.643
<v Speaker 1>Or He's in Akron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and it worry for a business </v>

434
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:56.214
<v Speaker 1>appointment and it comes on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the hotel that he's staying at </v>

435
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and he sees the bar and he hears the </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and he's tempted to go in and,</v>

436
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but adjacent to the entrance to the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a public telephone.</v>

437
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

438
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes a chance and he rings up and he</v>

439
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 1>calls up a local priest and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

440
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:14.120
<v Speaker 1>if you've got anyone or a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he calls like a,</v>

441
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:14.954
<v Speaker 1>have you got any [inaudible] have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got anyone in this area that's been </v>

442
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 1>coming in going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a terrible drunk,</v>

443
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:20.880
<v Speaker 1>helped me help me.</v>

444
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.721
<v Speaker 1>And that guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

445
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

446
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>can you put me in touch with that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I need some serious help.</v>

447
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to help him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

448
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:27.564
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy needs a few more phone calls </v>

449
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>here and there as they make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>

450
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:30.324
<v Speaker 1>but eventually ends up with Doctor Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other founder of alcoholics </v>

451
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>anonymous goes around his eyes and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says to this guy,</v>

452
00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this problem.</v>

453
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.453
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm unable to stop drinking once I </v>

454
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ruining my life.</v>

455
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I ruined on my relationships with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

456
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Opportunities fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's destroying me.</v>

457
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.500
<v Speaker 1>It to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's condition.</v>

458
00:20:48.501 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 1>The other guy starts talking about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

459
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:53.460
<v Speaker 1>The two of them having initially like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bird there,</v>

460
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>apparently the doctor Bob Guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to tell him like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally secretary,</v>

462
00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 1>come get this guy off the 10 minutes.</v>

463
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems a bit weird.</v>

464
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting phone calls out of blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people want to talk about boots,</v>

465
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.020
<v Speaker 1>they end up talking for hours and hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hours.</v>

466
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.680
<v Speaker 1>They recognize at the end of the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours that neither of them would want it</v>

467
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:13.681
<v Speaker 1>to drink during that whole time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alcohol is not the problem.</v>

468
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol is the solution to the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>of living under the false ideals.</v>

469
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Of a materialistic society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are looking for something.</v>

470
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just can't live without that</v>

471
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.244
<v Speaker 1>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they find another solution to living </v>

472
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 1>without the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Booze,</v>

473
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

474
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.173
<v Speaker 1>gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we're all on the scale </v>

475
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:36.634
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us are one way or another trying </v>

476
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>to come up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>

477
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:40.510
<v Speaker 1>like couple of days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of them,</v>

478
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they start going to hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling other people.</v>

479
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.453
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in people here that are here </v>

480
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.450
<v Speaker 1>because of alcohol related problems.</v>

481
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude over in that bed,</v>

482
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:48.814
<v Speaker 1>he's been a pain in the ass all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hear him shouting from behind </v>

483
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the curtain and that the two of them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

484
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 1>hit him up and suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

485
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.611
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:57.490
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more than me,</v>

487
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within luckily historical terms,</v>

488
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 1>this is only the 1930s we're in 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

489
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 1>This thing grows and grows and grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People realize,</v>

490
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this works.</v>

491
00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:06.994
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that it's written in the Christian </v>

492
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:14.251
<v Speaker 1>language of the time is written in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal terminology of the time.</v>

493
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.310
<v Speaker 1>It's also understandably protective of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its identity.</v>

494
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.183
<v Speaker 1>The anonymity is to make sure that Aa as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing is protected and that no one </v>

495
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:26.020
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not me,</v>

496
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:26.921
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

497
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm Mr Aa because I know that I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>still crazy.</v>

498
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I could drink or take drugs tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send me captains and you know,</v>

499
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

500
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly,</v>

501
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've made clear in the book,</v>

502
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not written from a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

503
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.493
<v Speaker 1>It's written from a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and I don't know better than </v>

504
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.124
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what crazy things I'm </v>

505
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:48.340
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

506
00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but I know that if I work this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right.</v>

507
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 1>If I work this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right.</v>

508
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.313
<v Speaker 1>The only problem stuff for me when I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll take control of this </v>

509
00:22:55.531 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>situation and starting that cause me </v>
<v Speaker 1>then ego,</v>

510
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>

511
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rage.</v>

512
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.063
<v Speaker 1>The other program steps back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason the spirit is important </v>

513
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>because it's the only thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend the material.</v>

514
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:08.674
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that can house it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the crucible of the material </v>

515
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is consciousness?</v>

516
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Where did it come from?</v>

517
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>What the fucking hell is going on Brad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

518
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very simple tool,</v>

519
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.803
<v Speaker 1>it gives us access to consciousness in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we will not attain if we live </v>

520
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:24.214
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with our biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives and a culture that uses it to </v>

521
00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>turn us into passive consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

522
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I think you can connect this to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of the times in terms of,</v>

523
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

524
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we constantly told that nobody's in </v>

525
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:34.151
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

526
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>So we have to accept insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

527
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and that can lead to a lot of people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an anxious.</v>

528
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:39.274
<v Speaker 1>But what York seemed to be saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually letting go of this very </v>

529
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous idea that we can be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of other people's behaviors,</v>

530
00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 1>other people's lives,</v>

531
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 2>like bloody North Korea this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we dwell on these things,</v>

532
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

533
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:51.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this constant state of anxiety about </v>

534
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 2>things we can't possibly deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's kind of,</v>

535
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 2>and how do we seek some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmation out of this world.</v>

536
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.473
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said it a different sense of the </v>

537
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 2>consciousness might be the alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

538
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.790
<v Speaker 2>But I want to come back to your story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you know,</v>

539
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 2>this question of confining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the example you talk about,</v>

540
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two guys were speaking and of </v>

541
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:15.080
<v Speaker 2>course there they are confiding in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and that idea of have to confide</v>

542
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 2>in one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That of course requires confidence,</v>

543
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:18.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To confide requires confidence.</v>

544
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.053
<v Speaker 2>You need to have the confidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>confide in somebody and it might be a </v>

545
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.374
<v Speaker 2>random stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least you have an established </v>

546
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Speaker 2>trust around this kind of sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 2>of the confidence.</v>

548
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And there's a particular passage I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read from the book.</v>

549
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.133
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only I think because it brought a </v>

550
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>tear to my eye and I don't to shut on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your illusions people have of me.</v>

551
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I do have emotions every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it.</v>

552
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I did an excerpt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trues on suicide and you,</v>

553
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're reading the side of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tin of beans.</v>

554
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I know you're very emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because you know,</v>

555
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I think it really addresses what's at </v>
<v Speaker 2>stake here and this kind of,</v>

556
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:52.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

557
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:53.294
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly my fraught and frighten </v>

558
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:55.964
<v Speaker 2>childhood became reasonable and soothed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mum was doing her best and so it was </v>

559
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>my bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

560
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 2>people have made mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what humans do and I am under</v>

561
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.294
<v Speaker 2>no obligation to hoard these errors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow them to clutter my perception of </v>

562
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:09.734
<v Speaker 2>the present.</v>

563
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.843
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is wrong that I was abused as a </v>

564
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:12.704
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is no reason for me to relive </v>

565
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 2>it consciously or unconsciously in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I conduct my adult relationship,</v>

566
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.083
<v Speaker 2>my perceptions of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even my own memories are not objective </v>

567
00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:24.734
<v Speaker 2>or absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are biased and they come be </v>

568
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:28.034
<v Speaker 2>altered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this to me is a really powerful </v>

569
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:30.794
<v Speaker 2>passage in the book because what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about is not only can we </v>

570
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:35.084
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide and we do have a choice around </v>

571
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.893
<v Speaker 2>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about the things that we </v>

572
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:40.724
<v Speaker 2>hold and carry along with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that we can ever forget </v>

573
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:43.784
<v Speaker 2>them or we can outlive them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can choose whether they define </v>

574
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:48.350
<v Speaker 2>our lives are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the fitbit central message,</v>

575
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:49.184
<v Speaker 2>which I think comes out of this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very positive message is if you do </v>

576
00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:53.024
<v Speaker 2>confined in others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the transformative </v>

577
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:55.904
<v Speaker 2>potential happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot simply trans wake up one day </v>

578
00:25:58.761 --> 00:25:59.594
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be an entirely new </v>

579
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>subjectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

580
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen that way because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to change your behavior,</v>

581
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you need to change your behavior in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes of others,</v>

582
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are human,</v>

583
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not human beings,</v>

584
00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:11.054
<v Speaker 2>we're human becomings right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd always connecting to people in </v>

585
00:26:12.991 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>disconnecting and reconnecting and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sense it requires a certain,</v>

586
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence to transform.</v>

587
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I wondering what you think about it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of your experiences,</v>

588
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Brad.</v>

589
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.103
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that recurs lately </v>
<v Speaker 1>since Yanis Varoufakis it on this </v>

590
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 1>podcast was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:31.780
<v Speaker 1>we exist in dialectic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is of like,</v>

592
00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:32.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seal me in a pod and shoot me into </v>

593
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:35.110
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an,</v>

594
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.260
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I without rf Jarvis cocker,</v>

595
00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:40.540
<v Speaker 1>put it more simply without people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are nothing,</v>

596
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so like yeah,</v>

597
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 1>quite right that it is a collective and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communal activity.</v>

598
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 1>This book you could learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could read it on your own,</v>

599
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:51.384
<v Speaker 1>you could do the program on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but primarily it's about how you relate </v>

600
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 1>to yourself and how you relate to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

601
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passage that you read from a book,</v>

602
00:26:58.531 --> 00:26:59.364
<v Speaker 1>just to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abuse happened outside of my family </v>

603
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.563
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I think is important </v>

604
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.980
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

605
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

606
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:08.803
<v Speaker 1>the my stance that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one can alter their perception of the </v>

607
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 1>past and if you will alter your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of the past,</v>

608
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you will to the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that there?</v>

609
00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said there,</v>

610
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 1>there is no objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

611
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a state that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to achieve.</v>

612
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Just sat in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Chondrocyte that to yourself.</v>

613
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It has to be realized in relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

614
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

615
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.193
<v Speaker 2>I want to connect this then now then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social implications of the project </v>

616
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:38.320
<v Speaker 2>that you've already talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

617
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.183
<v Speaker 2>you see kind of addiction as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not just an individual </v>

618
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.850
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a social construct,</v>

619
00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

620
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>society gives you these certain values </v>

621
00:27:49.481 --> 00:27:50.314
<v Speaker 2>and those values in many ways play to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human desires in a way which lend </v>

622
00:27:53.621 --> 00:27:56.580
<v Speaker 2>themselves to addictive personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually we are taught to desire the</v>

623
00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 2>very things which could bring us back </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to it.</v>

624
00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.343
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our knees.</v>

625
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about the tub log </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing Britain,</v>

626
00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:02.620
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of revealing of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.990
<v Speaker 2>we'd like nothing more than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity who falls,</v>

628
00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:06.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's almost like this,</v>

629
00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:08.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not the system failing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's working all too well,</v>

630
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we kind of expect us,</v>

631
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:11.314
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want this to kind of happen and you </v>

632
00:28:12.761 --> 00:28:14.890
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to kind of connect it also to</v>

633
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:18.080
<v Speaker 2>your other work on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you know,</v>

634
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:18.933
<v Speaker 2>some of the other powerful work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocacy work you've done on the war on </v>

635
00:28:21.881 --> 00:28:24.640
<v Speaker 2>drugs and Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this question of addiction to drugs.</v>

636
00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:25.863
<v Speaker 2>Now as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically the war on drugs has been </v>

637
00:28:27.971 --> 00:28:28.804
<v Speaker 2>kind of separated between almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>war legal paradigm versus a Health </v>

638
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Development Paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I think,</v>

639
00:28:34.031 --> 00:28:34.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shift towards seeing it as a health </v>

640
00:28:36.341 --> 00:28:40.360
<v Speaker 2>problem is a positive shift away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall paradigm.</v>

641
00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.840
<v Speaker 2>But too often when we shifted then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the health paradigm,</v>

642
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it invariably retreats back into </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual pathology,</v>

643
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.003
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the person who's just simply a </v>

644
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:50.714
<v Speaker 2>fault because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've fallen through the cracks or </v>

645
00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:53.584
<v Speaker 2>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what your book is also </v>

646
00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:56.980
<v Speaker 2>trying to do is add another layer onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and say,</v>

647
00:28:56.981 --> 00:28:58.420
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:28:58.421 --> 00:29:01.120
<v Speaker 2>addiction is a health problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental health problem.</v>

649
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.283
<v Speaker 2>But unless we understand the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences and the social effects </v>

650
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.440
<v Speaker 2>which give rise to this problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly feed it,</v>

651
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.760
<v Speaker 2>then we will not gain a real tangible </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchase on this.</v>

652
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what your thoughts on this,</v>

653
00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:19.180
<v Speaker 2>cause this is to me is I find is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important in terms of really pushing the</v>

654
00:29:19.181 --> 00:29:23.140
<v Speaker 2>debate forward on addiction and the war </v>
<v Speaker 2>on drugs more generally.</v>

655
00:29:23.141 --> 00:29:23.974
<v Speaker 2>And my question of violence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else which follows the </v>

656
00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:29.170
<v Speaker 2>criminalization of drugs is a useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>social yeah.</v>

657
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 1>In the management of populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been explored in films like</v>

658
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>13th and the House I live in brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>films on,</v>

659
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:38.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the criminalization of drugs allows </v>

660
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

661
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>portions of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

662
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 1>form of Niekro politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating new economies,</v>

663
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 1>new opportunities for social management </v>
<v Speaker 1>and social engineering,</v>

664
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.553
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically requires slavery in some </v>

665
00:29:57.551 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 1>form to sustain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] health model.</v>

666
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

667
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't really thought of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

668
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.913
<v Speaker 1>The implications of a health model is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>determinant means that individual </v>

669
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:14.881
<v Speaker 1>pathology is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is southernly the defining contribute to</v>

670
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:17.974
<v Speaker 1>the condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is clearly a relationship like a </v>

671
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>young man Hari's written about addiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he like the example he sites his rat</v>

672
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 1>park where you know rats that were kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>in conditions like that.</v>

673
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:31.324
<v Speaker 1>You know like cause it's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll love this is a a postmodernist </v>

674
00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:34.714
<v Speaker 1>dear brad that there's the assumption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what normal is in in laboratory </v>

675
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 1>conditions though they with unthinkingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

676
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.120
<v Speaker 1>have this is normal and they put rats in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cages and got a lot of these wraps.</v>

677
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.730
<v Speaker 1>They much prefer the water bottle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was full of crack cocaine,</v>

678
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the normal water and then someone point </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

679
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.070
<v Speaker 1>oh no mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably horrible.</v>

680
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.904
<v Speaker 1>Avoid that cage and sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right let's give him a nice cage </v>

681
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>then we've all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:55.954
<v Speaker 1>good shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they stopped taking crack curiously </v>

683
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.213
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know there is undoubtedly like </v>

684
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.593
<v Speaker 1>addiction can affect anybody but </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly chemical dependency but it </v>

685
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 1>is certainly exacerbated by economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>depravity.</v>

686
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>But there are different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depravity.</v>

687
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Also emotional depravity is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a condition that the,</v>

688
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:22.961
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the economically deprived </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have exclusively control of hello</v>

689
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>be nice from turf exclusive and trolling</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

690
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 1>But it's effects are felt more there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get into treatment,</v>

691
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:35.820
<v Speaker 1>if you can't afford to address it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely that you,</v>

692
00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:36.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're criminalized from the get </v>

693
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

694
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.213
<v Speaker 1>You're already a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now is what degree of criminality is </v>

695
00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:46.090
<v Speaker 1>it that you're going to cop for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to that,</v>

696
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:46.924
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on a police raid in west London </v>

697
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 1>once and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.234
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very revelator re-experienced </v>

699
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:55.564
<v Speaker 1>for me Brad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause like the bad the door in of what </v>

700
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>was a crack house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

701
00:31:58.961 --> 00:31:59.794
<v Speaker 1>even the term crack house once I've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>like even me as a person that's been </v>

702
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 1>crack houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really sort of questioned the</v>

703
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Speaker 1>idea that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an Aos,</v>

704
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.033
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a crack house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you went here like we went in there </v>

705
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and bought dwelt within the crack house </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not monsters.</v>

706
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like beating down the door of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leukemia ward,</v>

707
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 1>thin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emaciated,</v>

708
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 1>broken people slumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pale in a chair,</v>

709
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 1>denied sunlight of every variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual and literal just holding their</v>

710
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:36.211
<v Speaker 1>lives together with drugs and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly circular that this program</v>

711
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 1>on an individual level takes from self </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession and narcissism and deposits.</v>

712
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.763
<v Speaker 1>You are a point of service and kindness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is precisely the program </v>

713
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that's required on a social level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have an inclusive,</v>

714
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 1>empathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving society that that necessarily you</v>

715
00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.323
<v Speaker 1>the these you include people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would become a more inclusive </v>

716
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:01.844
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this model of sacrifice that </v>

717
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 1>exists within Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

718
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:08.324
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

719
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God for me,</v>

720
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I apply in my life when I ever I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

721
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that guy's homeless so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be a mate of mine.</v>

722
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Got his leg amputated recently and he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who works this program.</v>

723
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I met him at a sort of a conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>for drug addicts,</v>

724
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 1>very badly organized and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was on crutches and like,</v>

725
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh you white mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd only met him once before,</v>

726
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a nice guy,</v>

727
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:37.670
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know him that well.</v>

728
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Pete.</v>

729
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you all right mate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

730
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

731
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 1>what's with the crutches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

732
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 1>expecting are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 1>a trip to broke my ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of minor interest story.</v>

734
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

735
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.703
<v Speaker 1>I've got cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having my leg amputated at the knee </v>

736
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've fucking ill bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

737
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:53.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

738
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

739
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I want to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be clean.</v>

740
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.273
<v Speaker 1>And I was sort of like some wave hit me </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the truth of what he was saying </v>

741
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 1>and the beauty cell four oh learn about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this person.</v>

742
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll call his number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed in touch with the week leading up</v>

743
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 1>to the amputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fine the night before.</v>

744
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>The amputation is fine for at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amputation.</v>

745
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I speak to them the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on a,</v>

746
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.583
<v Speaker 1>on a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admittedly on opiates because of the </v>

747
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 1>nature of the pain medication.</v>

748
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.753
<v Speaker 1>It were blissfully happy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to be because with this </v>

749
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:21.950
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a program is effective.</v>

750
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.920
<v Speaker 1>He transcends the material condition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just says,</v>

751
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my leg is being amputated.</v>

752
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.153
<v Speaker 1>I can't control that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can control my reaction to my leg </v>

753
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 1>being amputated and I think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it obviously out of my head.</v>

754
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 1>How was this guy managing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is he doing it?</v>

755
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Because he's not putting it on and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to him every day or at Ross,</v>

756
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:43.030
<v Speaker 1>some just doing this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

757
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing of recording another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

758
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.710
<v Speaker 1>So also he's happy and the reason is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's accepted it.</v>

759
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:49.544
<v Speaker 1>He surrendered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's working this program and he's </v>

760
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 1>getting on with his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not gone now.</v>

761
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I will be defined by this problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievable.</v>

762
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.793
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievable to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that powerful and it's that </v>

763
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:00.230
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>

764
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Now he does this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we say in communion,</v>

765
00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 1>in conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it works on an individual level,</v>

766
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.833
<v Speaker 1>but you're quite right brad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that we should </v>

767
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.870
<v Speaker 1>ascribe to individual pathology because </v>
<v Speaker 1>where are these bloody boundaries?</v>

768
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean an individual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all made of the same stuff.</v>

769
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>We're all thinking the same force rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling the same feelings other than the</v>

770
00:35:18.231 --> 00:35:23.231
<v Speaker 1>variety provided by cultural inflection </v>
<v Speaker 1>and social conditions were all basically</v>

771
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.253
<v Speaker 1>basically the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if we have systems that </v>

772
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:28.184
<v Speaker 1>encourage empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have systems that emphasize the </v>

773
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Corolla and connection between us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we will build a better.</v>

774
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:35.204
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

775
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>and I want to push you on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>

776
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 2>which is recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

777
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:43.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could offer almost like a simplistic</v>

778
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 2>reductive reading of the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is almost like,</v>

779
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you kind of go back to a </v>

780
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 2>previous better self?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

781
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:51.804
<v Speaker 2>So how do I recover myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the George Best </v>

782
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:54.211
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

783
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 2>where does it all go wrong in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

784
00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And then if you can pinpoint this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as we go,</v>

785
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.433
<v Speaker 2>as you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.540
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people who are in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition,</v>

787
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.523
<v Speaker 2>it's the social forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complex social forces that is no </v>

788
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 2>pinpointable moment in somebody's life </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can say,</v>

789
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:07.794
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of what it all goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the way I understand in the </v>

790
00:36:10.941 --> 00:36:11.774
<v Speaker 2>way you're using the term recovery also </v>
<v Speaker 2>is also a critique of the idea that we </v>

791
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 2>can live a perfectible life under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

792
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the striking things which comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out for me of this is kind of a humility</v>

793
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 2>with what you're talking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:26.514
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only not to take yourself too </v>

795
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although we have,</v>

796
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to deal with serious issues in </v>

797
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also this idea that it's okay not to</v>

798
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>be okay sometimes and to admit this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no bad thing.</v>

799
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.130
<v Speaker 1>That's true and this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

800
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:40.964
<v Speaker 1>I've only really found in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been spiritual conversations and </v>

801
00:36:45.741 --> 00:36:47.930
<v Speaker 1>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not in the right word,</v>

802
00:36:47.931 --> 00:36:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has always been framed spiritually.</v>

803
00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Like when I talked to Sharon Salzberg on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>

804
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.060
<v Speaker 1>she said that when you're meditating is </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

805
00:36:56.061 --> 00:36:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that you start thinking all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't punish yourself for that.</v>

806
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.120
<v Speaker 1>You just returned to the mantra or </v>
<v Speaker 1>return to the breath.</v>

807
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.063
<v Speaker 1>You accept fallibility as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the equation of your humanity </v>

808
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:09.043
<v Speaker 1>that you to a degree relinquish the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perfection but sort of somewhat </v>

809
00:37:12.951 --> 00:37:14.810
<v Speaker 1>paradoxically I suppose Brad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

810
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.693
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one of the meanings or implications </v>

811
00:37:17.721 --> 00:37:18.554
<v Speaker 1>of the term recovery is that you recover</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person you're supposed to be </v>

812
00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:23.120
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be an info Commons I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>

813
00:37:23.121 --> 00:37:28.121
<v Speaker 1>but meaning that I natural bio chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities that as a human being or a tree</v>

814
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.540
<v Speaker 1>does have in it a code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an intention,</v>

815
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it will grow a certain way if unimpeded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

816
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 1>in our case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

817
00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:37.870
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

818
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.130
<v Speaker 1>familial conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what this,</v>

819
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.203
<v Speaker 1>the point of recovery is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to get you back onto that intended </v>

820
00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:44.864
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is my belief that the intended </v>

821
00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>path is not to be a passive consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just cooperates as an,</v>

822
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.760
<v Speaker 1>as a unit within a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a system of sales.</v>

823
00:37:55.761 --> 00:37:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Just as a statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are engaged.</v>

824
00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:03.851
<v Speaker 1>We must re be reborn until the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we can become really what we are</v>

825
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:07.070
<v Speaker 1>so that we can become what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

826
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.263
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

827
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.713
<v Speaker 2>did of rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kind of try to end then on </v>

828
00:38:11.761 --> 00:38:12.594
<v Speaker 2>a very positive note and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the start of the book you </v>

829
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 2>deal with the big impending d or The </v>
<v Speaker 2>death question,</v>

830
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nothing more positive than death.</v>

831
00:38:21.931 --> 00:38:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

832
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>and as you pointed out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the introduction,</v>

833
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>the reality of death individually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet it's certain,</v>

834
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something we don't like to talk about</v>

835
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:31.240
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

836
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.363
<v Speaker 2>and yet of course we know from Plato </v>
<v Speaker 2>onwards there's this idea that to is </v>

837
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 2>effectively to lay it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die,</v>

838
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I need to learn and to death might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a physical death.</v>

839
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>It might be the death of a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the death of,</v>

840
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea of the death of a person you </v>

841
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 2>once were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can kind of more than this,</v>

842
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>

843
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.304
<v Speaker 2>however think this goes far enough and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think actually we might need to take it </v>

844
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 2>a stage further.</v>

845
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's a quote from David Bowie </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he puts it,</v>

846
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:54.844
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is for people who fear how </v>

847
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.140
<v Speaker 2>spirituality is for people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

848
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with this in mind,</v>

849
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:01.804
<v Speaker 2>I think the question your book kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves me asking is how can we learn to </v>

850
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>examine our lives in a way in which may </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

851
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the addict,</v>

852
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a certain experiential value,</v>

853
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they have seen rock bottom,</v>

854
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can look at life almost the example</v>

855
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 2>you give of the people who are deprived </v>
<v Speaker 2>of light,</v>

856
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this amazing created state,</v>

857
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 2>they know what it means to look at life </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of death,</v>

858
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old must already dead,</v>

859
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

860
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:33.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of then your hopes for the </v>

861
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:35.974
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

862
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.873
<v Speaker 2>and looking at the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we learn and maybe take the </v>

863
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:40.714
<v Speaker 2>voices of these people much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously in terms of if we appreciate </v>

864
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>we're all kind of knee deep in the mud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

865
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.430
<v Speaker 2>And we know existence is tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know existence is also wonderful.</v>

866
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.343
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how can we maybe learn to go beyond </v>

867
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:55.324
<v Speaker 2>this question of just simply learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to die and look at life from the </v>

868
00:39:58.271 --> 00:39:59.104
<v Speaker 2>perspective of death and become much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more affirmative of what we actually </v>

869
00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 2>have in this all too fleeting existence?</v>

870
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

871
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become certain,</v>

872
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:15.961
<v Speaker 1>quite simplistic attitude or north </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts such as acceptance,</v>

873
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.370
<v Speaker 1>gratitude that I relinquish the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

874
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not homeless in a Gob smacked up off</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nut because I'm somehow superior,</v>

875
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.443
<v Speaker 1>but just because of a sort of a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of coordinates and events have </v>

876
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 1>deposited me in a comfortable life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>

877
00:40:36.371 --> 00:40:37.204
<v Speaker 1>really lucky and gracious so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a punitive attitude towards those </v>

878
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see him in like,</v>

879
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sometimes he'll write ourselves,</v>

880
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 1>but where I came as repositories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it potentially of great truves and um,</v>

881
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.460
<v Speaker 1>important information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

882
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:56.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the recovery charities </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations that do work with it,</v>

883
00:40:57.731 --> 00:40:58.564
<v Speaker 1>Bac O'connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run facilities in Burton on trend </v>

884
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 1>in their United Kingdom and stoke on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trent in the middle and as those areas.</v>

885
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 1>And I went to an event with them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and like just spoke to that </v>

886
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:12.370
<v Speaker 1>service users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means in this case,</v>

887
00:41:12.371 --> 00:41:13.204
<v Speaker 1>drug addicts and stuff and like to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>through what they're doing in their </v>

888
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:16.330
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

889
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.163
<v Speaker 1>The counselors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good number of the counselors </v>

890
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in recovery,</v>

891
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 1>which I think is always very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>

892
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.923
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife was there and that sort of sat </v>

893
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:26.860
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put on a lovely spread for us.</v>

894
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>God loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

895
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.673
<v Speaker 1>some Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe something even as far flung as </v>

896
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:31.714
<v Speaker 1>Bruschetta a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of Bruschetta would get in </v>

897
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>stoke on Trent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

898
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May have been involved.</v>

899
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:37.341
<v Speaker 1>I manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

900
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

901
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:39.254
<v Speaker 1>there's this bloke there who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper to glance at like if you can </v>

902
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 1>imagine shaggy from the cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scooby Doo,</v>

903
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.093
<v Speaker 1>but he slept outside for a year and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a bloody good kick in and no dental </v>

904
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:51.560
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what this guy looked like,</v>

905
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:56.561
<v Speaker 1>fin broken and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like drug addicts obviously.</v>

906
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of,</v>

907
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 1>he's come lay and he's fin is fuck.</v>

908
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ransacking the buffet quite gently,</v>

909
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thinking of this food.</v>

910
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll take that and sort of packing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and stuff and all goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the like,</v>

917
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:15.764
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm among other people that have </v>

918
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:18.104
<v Speaker 1>got addiction issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I don't have the obligation </v>

919
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:20.804
<v Speaker 1>to try and act like I know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing or that I'm clever or that I'm in </v>

920
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:25.830
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

921
00:42:25.831 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 1>sank too about feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

922
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 1>like I maybe mentioned fame in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

923
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:30.981
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

924
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 1>but I do get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get nervous and I get frightened.</v>

925
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.480
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you get it?</v>

926
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 1>And for you like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Russell brand and like,</v>

927
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 1>who cares what other people think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

928
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.083
<v Speaker 1>if you would imagine there's people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you if they don't know you're </v>

929
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking right.</v>

930
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is highly colloquial,</v>

931
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.973
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.323
<v Speaker 1>also for me is sort of profound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and also the fact that he's </v>

933
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 1>even willing to take that role when </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting someone who's,</v>

934
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of visiting in kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

935
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm here as a patron of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

936
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

937
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.800
<v Speaker 1>he's not like dumbfounded by the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm nervous and fearful.</v>

938
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 1>He accepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

939
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just the same as me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an honor in that,</v>

940
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real honor.</v>

941
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think they've awakened people not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only realize it but somehow can live it.</v>

942
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of realizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the challenge is living in,</v>

943
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is,</v>

944
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.833
<v Speaker 1>there is no distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no separation between him and </v>

945
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were all experiencing it.</v>

946
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Great Bill Hicks said,</v>

947
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 1>we were all one consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing itself subjectively.</v>

948
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And when I realize I'm live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not on my own anymore,</v>

949
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid anymore.</v>

950
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:36.223
<v Speaker 1>I don't have these obligations to prop </v>
<v Speaker 1>up some Avatar of myself that people </v>

951
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:40.844
<v Speaker 1>might love or approve of or boost up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>make much off to ameliorate some inner </v>

952
00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:47.830
<v Speaker 1>sense of worthlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is uh,</v>

953
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solve is in the wound,</v>

954
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the salvage in the wound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

955
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 1>when someone punishingly says I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthless,</v>

956
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:55.424
<v Speaker 1>I am nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it trying to reach the truth beneath </v>

957
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>that that we are essentially not </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided,</v>

958
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 1>separate from and therefore are </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in the one.</v>

959
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:09.700
<v Speaker 1>This is not about annihilation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self as in the subjugation,</v>

960
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of refer to your work in a violent </v>

961
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.353
<v Speaker 1>and destructive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the recognition that there is no </v>

962
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:18.464
<v Speaker 1>need for fear and there is no disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>need for desire because we are already </v>

963
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:26.960
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are already one and that these things</v>

964
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 1>are not just philosophical tropes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>empty mantras.</v>

965
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.274
<v Speaker 1>They are things you can live by </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that your own suffering can </v>

966
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:38.760
<v Speaker 1>become a tool and the suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others can be an opportunity.</v>

967
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.713
<v Speaker 1>If you can just break out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting and imposed paradigm that </v>

968
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you are here to earn money that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth is established by what you've got.</v>

969
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

970
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:51.144
<v Speaker 1>oh Jason Segel the act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm friends with him and he went all </v>

971
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 1>those things we defined ourselves by </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

972
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:56.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a billboard up with your </v>

973
00:44:57.331 --> 00:44:58.164
<v Speaker 1>face on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the symptoms of other people </v>

974
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 1>making money out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you,</v>

975
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.533
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of that being flown around in a </v>

976
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:06.204
<v Speaker 1>jet and fate it over like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's not something to fear not </v>

977
00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something too.</v>

978
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 1>We've escaped because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

979
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:15.901
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

980
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:16.880
<v Speaker 1>in it's way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

981
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 1>there is glamour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They of course,</v>

982
00:45:18.721 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>glamour is a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People respond to it,</v>

983
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no real worth in it.</v>

984
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I met that homeless guy once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let not,</v>

985
00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:28.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was not homeless.</v>

986
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 1>He was going to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was some homeless people.</v>

987
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:30.654
<v Speaker 1>I met him in New Orleans and he was off </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go and sort of help out or some </v>

988
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 1>homeless deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.380
<v Speaker 1>feeding homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't recognize that was famous,</v>

990
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 1>that sweaty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>

991
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fame money,</v>

992
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crumbs I want to be at.</v>

993
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:44.994
<v Speaker 1>The bank quit the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit and somehow been tricked into </v>

994
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.893
<v Speaker 1>finger near.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what real religious people tell </v>

995
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:50.701
<v Speaker 1>you that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll get out of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm crack on.</v>

997
00:45:52.131 --> 00:45:54.710
<v Speaker 1>We it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not about subjugation.</v>

998
00:45:54.711 --> 00:45:56.840
<v Speaker 1>This is not about asset as Susan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not about denial.</v>

999
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:57.674
<v Speaker 1>This is about finding the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often the material world is </v>

1000
00:46:00.291 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>preventing you from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting there,</v>

1001
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.693
<v Speaker 1>is preventing you from getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause we caught up and you want to </v>

1002
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.580
<v Speaker 1>mentation and we can't see that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all part of one garment.</v>

1003
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then to kind of sum up,</v>

1004
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the one thing which I've take really </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken from the book,</v>

1005
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:14.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being alone and loneliness is the </v>

1006
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:19.014
<v Speaker 1>greatest killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it because not only does it result </v>

1007
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Speaker 1>in people dying prematurely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can kill your sense of self esteem</v>

1008
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 1>and dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the two,</v>

1009
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:30.043
<v Speaker 1>I guess messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wanted maybe just reiterate it </v>

1010
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 1>for why take from the book is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are feeling alone,</v>

1011
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 1>speak to someone or if you see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's lonely,</v>

1012
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.713
<v Speaker 1>just give them a helping hand because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably need you more than you </v>

1013
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.713
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that to me is the one thing </v>

1014
00:46:44.671 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted didn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take from the book and is that how,</v>

1015
00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:48.264
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any final comments on that </v>

1016
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.080
<v Speaker 1>or do you try to remind myself when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to people like about,</v>

1017
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:53.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to another human being and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to talk to them with love and </v>

1018
00:46:58.021 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>respect and often if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the opportunity is explicit,</v>

1019
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:03.121
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

1020
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:03.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with someone that's got drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol problems or some other </v>

1021
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 1>problem that I identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an opportunity to be loving.</v>

1022
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.553
<v Speaker 1>I forget this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty long distance from </v>

1023
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I tried to remember,</v>

1024
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you know like Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't really look at that person in</v>

1025
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't make it an attempt to connect</v>

1026
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:20.244
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can come from a perspective of </v>

1027
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:23.664
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to only be coming from </v>

1028
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:25.524
<v Speaker 1>self preservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not all here competing for </v>

1029
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:27.684
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a yes was perhaps there's some </v>

1030
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary truth to that millennia </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1031
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's not true now what are here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help one another and in deciding that we</v>

1032
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 1>can create it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasure.</v>

1033
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>
