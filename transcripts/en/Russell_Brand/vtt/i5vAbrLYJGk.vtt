1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>But it was when I picked up the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>in miracles,</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't claim to be for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the two of you,</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.133
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I got from the course in miracles </v>

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and I was in my mid twenties at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that this had not been </v>
<v Speaker 1>another things that I read,</v>

6
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason I didn't get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other things I had read.</v>

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's that there is no coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>God except to the person in front of you</v>

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>the course of miracles says belief in </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is doesn't mean anything.</v>

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.433
<v Speaker 1>It's the experience of God and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of God is our love for each </v>

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how in the course it says,</v>

12
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>some people conspire with God who do not</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet believe in him.</v>

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like you and I were talking before </v>
<v Speaker 1>about atheism and so forth.</v>

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I learned that the loving other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is secondary.</v>

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And my capacity to reach across the wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>that separates me from others through my</v>

17
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>own judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my own attack thoughts,</v>

18
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my own failure to take </v>

19
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self righteousness or whatever that work</v>

20
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>on myself is the spiritual work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

21
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.853
<v Speaker 2>pay yourself so that you are able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel God or love or whatever where it's </v>

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 2>convenient in your relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

23
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.563
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that'd is the experience at the cod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

25
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.823
<v Speaker 1>tell us more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the course in miracles says there </v>

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>is no getting to heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:23.834
<v Speaker 1>this says heaven is entered two by two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot get there unless you take </v>

28
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.044
<v Speaker 1>someone with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Heaven is not a condition or a </v>

29
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an awareness of our oneness.</v>

30
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So the course is not trying to get us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God.</v>

31
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to get us to believe in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

32
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>If you're in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my spiritual lesson and you're my</v>

33
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.644
<v Speaker 1>path to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The courses everyone you meet will </v>

34
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.464
<v Speaker 1>either be your crucified or your savior </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you choose to be to </v>

35
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.104
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

36
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my own,</v>

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.433
<v Speaker 2>like just literally on my mom to moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like a lot of my life was somehow </v>

38
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 2>this ossification of loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dreadful solitude,</v>

39
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 2>pain of loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I revisit it somehow often when alone,</v>

40
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 2>even briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittently like,</v>

41
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I arrive here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's late,</v>

43
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I go to the room and I feel sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>headachy and post flighty and alone.</v>

44
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.460
<v Speaker 2>And I have to remember that when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to other people,</v>

45
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 2>if I prepare myself in the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have described,</v>

46
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.981
<v Speaker 2>I will feel God and loving other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>even in just incidental communication.</v>

47
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Like when I talked to her personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

48
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 2>do you know if there's any yoga here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person really takes,</v>

49
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me try and find it.</v>

50
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.821
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

51
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>People are beautiful sometimes on my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get pretty scared.</v>

52
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:39.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

54
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:40.784
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be attacked or people won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be beautiful or the world won't take </v>

55
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 2>care of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you over time,</v>

56
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 2>been able to come cultivate a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

57
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:55.141
<v Speaker 2>a faith in God through relationships </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be sustainable even in periods</v>

58
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 2>of solitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

59
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an insurance.</v>

60
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

61
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.263
<v Speaker 1>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I have been these times of </v>

62
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder when was the time of wilderness</v>

63
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>for you or the garden?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book called tears to triumph,</v>

64
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.734
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the application of spiritual </v>

65
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>principles to human despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the issues that has been very,</v>

66
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been very passionate about is </v>

67
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>talking about they sociopathic economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how,</v>

68
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even human pain will be turned into a </v>

69
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>profit center if there's money to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made for some corporation.</v>

70
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very concerned about what I think of</v>

71
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:37.714
<v Speaker 1>as the psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopharmacological industrial </v>

72
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has chosen,</v>

73
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of $1 billion industry to </v>

74
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>medicalize human despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the matter is,</v>

75
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

76
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.894
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about bipolar or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or schizophrenia that's outside my lane </v>

77
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>outside of my purview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the normal spectrum of human despair</v>

78
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>is my lane.</v>

79
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Because the real spiritual path does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a yellow smiley face like this</v>

80
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and put it over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be happy,</v>

81
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.604
<v Speaker 1>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha would not have begun his path of </v>

82
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.834
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until he crossed his father's walls </v>

83
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.464
<v Speaker 1>and saw suffering for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses was sent by God to the Israelites </v>

84
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:25.771
<v Speaker 1>because they were suffering in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt as slaves and Jesus suffered on</v>

85
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>the cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real spiritual outlook recognizes</v>

86
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.383
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of the human condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we are living outside the context </v>

87
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>of our love for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

88
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:38.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

89
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>if you had a heartbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce,</v>

91
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>financial failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy,</v>

92
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>lost someone you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are painful,</v>

93
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>but they're not mental illnesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what us,</v>

94
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in that book I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what Buddhism says.</v>

95
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>This is what the Old Testament says is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the New Testament says.</v>

96
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Aa or anything else you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

97
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that's why you keep coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a rough day to day.</v>

98
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's recognize it's a rough day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's recognized.</v>

99
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're left on your own,</v>

100
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>God knows what your mind might lead you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

101
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So when you know principals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your path is,</v>

102
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you practice them.</v>

103
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>So you asked about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

104
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.680
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marianne.</v>

105
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>

106
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I've lived two periods of time that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

107
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>by any means today would be called </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical depression.</v>

108
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>But even that's such a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that means that somebody in a clinic</v>

109
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>set it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no blood test,</v>

110
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you've been there,</v>

111
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.724
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

112
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marianne,</v>

113
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>you number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even think this is going to be</v>

114
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>done quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So none of this like just,</v>

115
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today people say,</v>

116
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother died a month ago.</v>

117
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you over it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

118
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna take time.</v>

119
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.754
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the safe people who can </v>

120
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>accompany you on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are the people who will bear witness</v>

121
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.734
<v Speaker 1>to your agony during this time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that you're gonna </v>

122
00:05:58.761 --> 00:05:59.594
<v Speaker 1>need to support you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you have a lot of a bubble </v>

123
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:02.340
<v Speaker 1>bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

124
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you stay with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation even though you don't want to</v>

125
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>stay with your prayer work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

126
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>make sure you show up for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will be,</v>

127
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you will have a tendency to isolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>during this period of time.</v>

128
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>You must not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must get up and work.</v>

129
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:17.144
<v Speaker 1>Your subconscious will put aside your </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair while you're showing up for </v>

130
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you come back from that,</v>

131
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll go back to crying again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an art to navigating despair.</v>

132
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.173
<v Speaker 1>There is an art to navigating depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the spiritual spiritual principles </v>

133
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>lead us there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are seasons of life.</v>

134
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I quote in that book from Roca where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

135
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>let me not squander the hour of my pain.</v>
