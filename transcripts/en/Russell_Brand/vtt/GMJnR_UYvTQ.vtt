1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in mental health.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Why is that mate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You mad?</v>

3
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking back on your feet?</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have called myself.</v>

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.053
<v Speaker 1>I used to have severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe anxiety and depression about 10 </v>

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.214
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I'm now the anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression free for 10 years because of </v>

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I've got a rigid mental health system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to self care system.</v>

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:29.604
<v Speaker 1>Mainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky like I never suffered from </v>

10
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My issue was mental health,</v>

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>which to me means that my view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.383
<v Speaker 1>my view of other people and my view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was excessively negative and </v>

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:43.721
<v Speaker 1>fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just basically tested it.</v>

15
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.844
<v Speaker 1>I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read reappraised how I felt about </v>

16
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:50.664
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about other people and I do </v>

17
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that on a daily basis and mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime really,</v>

18
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different to exercise.</v>

19
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Could you first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we hear that,</v>

20
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure I'd like to hear what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do for your sort of,</v>

21
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.714
<v Speaker 1>your regimen for mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you describe the depression and </v>

22
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>anxiety as you experienced it 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>

23
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:09.414
<v Speaker 1>What was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it feel like and how did it </v>

24
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>impact your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>what have been about 18 or 19?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.973
<v Speaker 1>the thing is my main thing would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been anxiety and the thing is with </v>

27
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:19.974
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety can result in quite a lot of </v>

28
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>shame because my anxiety kept me from </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the house,</v>

29
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.143
<v Speaker 1>so I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get anxiety attacks in a certain </v>

30
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>place like in the pub are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket.</v>

31
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So the natural thing for me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the logical thing was,</v>

32
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soup markets given me anxiety attacks,</v>

33
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't go there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before newest I was kind of stuck in</v>

34
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>my room all the time.</v>

35
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Afraid to leave the house in case you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an anxiety attack that then brings a</v>

36
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.203
<v Speaker 1>ferocious amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shame would it because then I start </v>

37
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>judging myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on my friends,</v>

38
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go into the shop.</v>

39
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That then resulted in depression.</v>

40
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's this really shady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eager.</v>

41
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.853
<v Speaker 1>And I think the road of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was just afraid of being an </v>

42
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified of being autonomous,</v>

43
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

44
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.103
<v Speaker 1>what would you say you were taking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause and that was going to be my </v>

45
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>next question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I want you to know that</v>

46
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>that was gonna be my next question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as if I'm psychic,</v>

47
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>but was there some sort of trauma would </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say?</v>

48
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Or like what do you think precipitated </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

49
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:17.404
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand this thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cyclical idea of feeling ashamed </v>

50
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and not feeling like you can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

51
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I can still get a little bit like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>now as a matter of fact,</v>

52
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:25.674
<v Speaker 1>but like how does like do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would now relate that to oh this </v>

53
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>is because when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened and that happened.</v>

54
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that kind of awareness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like my parents were quite old and </v>

55
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>when I was borrowing a fairly bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>asthma,</v>

56
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>but my fucking enough for job back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking.</v>

57
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.103
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

58
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It says on the plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do not put this on your end.</v>

59
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I might add if they were going to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>something out,</v>

60
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>especially not if you've got asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing in a very mythic sense,</v>

61
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.170
<v Speaker 1>my mother first to point out because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want some to.</v>

62
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

63
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>no one is pointing to that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

64
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

65
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.783
<v Speaker 1>Bonding around of applause with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's opening up about their </v>

66
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>psychological history.</v>

67
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the level of narcissism we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>

68
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>So like your parents were older and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had asthma.</v>

69
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Very bad asthma and my dad would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been quite anxious.</v>

70
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>He and I can actually trace my father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety back to the famine.</v>

71
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.073
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he learned how to be anxious off his </v>

72
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>manner and his men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to be anxious.</v>

73
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I've heard Matt who was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>starving,</v>

74
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.593
<v Speaker 1>so patterns of of anxious behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive personality types will pass </v>

75
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>through and sort of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense.</v>

76
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.603
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be a generational trauma is </v>

77
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.814
<v Speaker 1>an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know quite a lot about </v>

78
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:46.984
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have a degree in it or </v>

79
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied,</v>

80
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.624
<v Speaker 1>I did like three or four years training </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a psychotherapist and then it </v>

81
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>stopped so I could wear a bag in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

82
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good decision.</v>

83
00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Good decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychotherapies last is plastic bags</v>

84
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we may like,</v>

85
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.933
<v Speaker 1>so would you say that idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>generational trauma does that you've </v>

86
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>just been quite frivolous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two ways like there,</v>

87
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

88
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.393
<v Speaker 1>there is actual research now being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>into trauma being been passed on </v>

89
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>genetically.</v>

90
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.513
<v Speaker 1>They're looking specifically as how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the Holocaust and how </v>

91
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>genetically trauma is passed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very new field,</v>

92
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>which is quite hard to get your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

93
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but the simple one is behaviors get </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed on.</v>

94
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're a young child and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're around.</v>

95
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.373
<v Speaker 1>If your parent is excessively angry or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a parent naturally looks at </v>

96
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.904
<v Speaker 1>things in a negative fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The child knows nothing other than to </v>

97
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>look at the parent as the authority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

98
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>So we learn these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the beauty of being the common,</v>

99
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 1>an adult psychotherapy and self help is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that narrative you learn as a child.</v>

100
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Once you to become a fucking adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go,</v>

101
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way it is.</v>

102
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I can rewrite my script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

103
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad used to.</v>

104
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>He found out that I had asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

105
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>the doctor would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a slight chance of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

107
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>and then my dad would have ran out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hospital going,</v>

108
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.413
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to die.</v>

109
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.433
<v Speaker 1>So when I was about three or four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was to want to play soccer with my </v>

110
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just start going,</v>

111
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll die.</v>

112
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was off putting.</v>

113
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

114
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he man on mark him,</v>

115
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So me being being four or five,</v>

116
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.063
<v Speaker 1>it's like the adult is telling me I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to die if I do normal things that </v>

117
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>my normal friends are doing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was to protect me.</v>

118
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:38.161
<v Speaker 1>But then when I got older and normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing meant going to fucking school,</v>

119
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>going out things that were adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>deepened way unconscious,</v>

120
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it manifested itself as a severe fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a debt.</v>

121
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>That's good analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good self analysis.</v>

122
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>How Japanese narrativize nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we are on this show.</v>

123
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>We upload self awareness kind of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

124
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like yeah,</v>

125
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.694
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting that they </v>

126
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>finished in Nevada or isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not think that?</v>

127
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense the,</v>

128
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:04.964
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central definition of adulthood and </v>

129
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>ability to control your own narrative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

130
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I am no longer my trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am no longer my past.</v>

131
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I can recreate myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

132
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>That is the key to being an adult I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is like,</v>

133
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's first off,</v>

134
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>it's understanding the intrinsic value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.713
<v Speaker 1>I am no better than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else has better than me because </v>

136
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I've got an intrinsic value that can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be taken away.</v>

137
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.413
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is to understand that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of your behavior can define your </v>

138
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>value as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me will say like my,</v>

139
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.663
<v Speaker 1>my creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my mental health is very much </v>

140
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>attached to my creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

141
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.053
<v Speaker 1>if I'm creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then chances are I'm in a good mental </v>

142
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.534
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.583
<v Speaker 1>if I'm procrastinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I ended up down the anxiety </v>

144
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

145
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crucial thing is tonight,</v>

146
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 1>horrible theme park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

148
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

149
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I make sure that my creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

150
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:10.264
<v Speaker 1>if I released a fucking short story or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast or whatever and it doesn't do </v>

151
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.454
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be very cautious around how </v>

152
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>much I beat myself up over that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow my,</v>

153
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:18.884
<v Speaker 1>an aspect of my behavior such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity to define my value as a </v>

154
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as important as very interesting because</v>

155
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:25.641
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>as a person that sort of toyed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity,</v>

157
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.233
<v Speaker 1>like I find it extremely difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that model that I just described of </v>

158
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>attachment eeg with pornography or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance misuse,</v>

159
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 1>if I start becoming overly attached yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>even to our list podcast is done well,</v>

160
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.720
<v Speaker 1>this has been unwell.</v>

161
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

162
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Then are googling your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google your name.</v>

163
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Do not</v>

164
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 2>who yourself write up the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No good ever.</v>
