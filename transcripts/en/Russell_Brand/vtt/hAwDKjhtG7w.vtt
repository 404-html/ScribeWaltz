<v Speaker 1>research in the neuroscience of voices,</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.613
<v Speaker 1>speech and laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's known for our public engagement </v>

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:09.224
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the life scientific.</v>

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Her research investigates the neural </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for vocal communication,</v>

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>how our brains process the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and voices,</v>

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>and how our brains control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of our voice.</v>

9
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's made me really self conscious of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice that has now sophie professor.</v>

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Sophie.</v>

11
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.594
<v Speaker 1>Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

12
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>thank you for professor coming here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this interview with me.</v>

13
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm very grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for inviting me.</v>

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.123
<v Speaker 1>I saw you on Jimmy Carr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan and indeed friend of Jimmy's </v>

15
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>and he'd done a horizon where he talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the neuro,</v>

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>the neurology of laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just summarize what you're doing</v>

17
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>on that show because it will help me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a show with you now.</v>

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.583
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came to me because I'm one of the </v>

19
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>few people researching laughter in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UK.</v>

20
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 2>If you go onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.470
<v Speaker 2>the major database of science papers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do a search on emotion expression of</v>

22
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get back over 4,000</v>

23
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>published papers on fear and if you do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>search on emotion expression,</v>

24
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 2>laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get back 150 papers there,</v>

25
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>just no papers in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did no research going on into it.</v>

26
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I was lucky that meant that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>will know what else they could ask about</v>

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.851
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 2>how and why we laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.813
<v Speaker 2>and that's something I've been looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking at it from a </v>

30
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>perspective of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we communicate with each other.</v>

31
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And I got interested in positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions in communication.</v>

32
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you start doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find that laughter is just weird.</v>

33
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's continuously founding conversation.</v>

34
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>People did much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than they think they do.</v>

35
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And we coordinate it really nicely in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

36
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ask people about laughter,</v>

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
<v Speaker 2>those what makes you love when you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll talk about jokes and comedy and </v>

38
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 2>humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually out in the wild,</v>

39
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 2>most laughter is just happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and people aren't laughing</v>

40
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 2>at jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me do laugh at jokes and comedy.</v>

41
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.224
<v Speaker 2>People are laughing to show that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know each other and like each other and </v>

42
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 2>understand each other.</v>

43
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean the social wild ocelot humans,</v>

44
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

45
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>primate people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

46
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.491
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

47
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I do notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened now for that sound.</v>

48
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And one of the aspects of laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

49
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>comedy and communication I'm interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in is the political discourse.</v>

50
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>John cleese has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant thing.</v>

51
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:20.421
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you're aware about a serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and solemnity seriousness and solemnity.</v>

52
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.323
<v Speaker 1>He said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people prohibit the use of humor in </v>

53
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.814
<v Speaker 1>particular areas of the public sphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its potency and its ability </v>

54
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:27.774
<v Speaker 1>to disrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always found it interesting </v>

55
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that with the emergence of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures like Nigel Farrage,</v>

56
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Boris Johnson and date Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are sort of used a different</v>

57
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>type of rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of accessibility and a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

59
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.703
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor has always been a part of the </v>

60
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>political discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

61
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:43.914
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make jokes all the time in </v>

62
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>parliament and in Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use humor to make people like them.</v>

63
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And I always think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.413
<v Speaker 1>some of the idioms around comedy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting make people laugh is a form </v>

65
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.614
<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you got to add to that </v>

66
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.583
<v Speaker 1>bloating?</v>

67
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

68
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.073
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredibly nuanced behavior in </v>

69
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.614
<v Speaker 2>adulthood and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think about its </v>

70
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>roots because its roots lie in play and </v>
<v Speaker 2>play behavior.</v>

71
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened when baby's first </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

72
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 2>When the parents take a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>picky with people,</v>

73
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you could move with them and that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out wrong.</v>

74
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Play peekaboo with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's a,</v>

75
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a response to a playfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no joke there.</v>

76
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.750
<v Speaker 2>There's no bigger structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

77
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand you're engaging with me in </v>

78
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:24.994
<v Speaker 2>this fun way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's absolutely basic to pro or </v>

79
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>primates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mammals.</v>

80
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a map that's a mammal behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

81
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>We understand that there are strata of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

82
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 2>So there's one by via,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever you.</v>

83
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>If I said I'm very offended by what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just said on this podcast,</v>

84
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would recognize that as,</v>

85
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is serious.</v>

86
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And then if I thought really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely gorgeous,</v>

87
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 2>then there's sort of a sense of relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.743
<v Speaker 2>So lack of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the acknowledgement that there are </v>

89
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>frequencies you saying and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequencies are vocally expressed,</v>

90
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 2>but they're real logically understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another demonstrable.</v>

91
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.513
<v Speaker 2>Is it like something that's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>play that neurologically that is not </v>

92
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>present in serious in the communication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

93
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:00.874
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can give you an </v>

94
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 2>equally good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that,</v>

95
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play is incredibly important to mammals </v>

96
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:09.374
<v Speaker 2>as they're developing all mammals play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if you grow up to be a </v>

97
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:13.534
<v Speaker 2>completely a Social Predator mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will see that would be like a </v>

98
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 2>tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

99
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old big cats.</v>

100
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even now I'm going to explain this </v>

101
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.164
<v Speaker 2>really badly paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you'll grow up to be a very </v>

102
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 2>frightening mammal.</v>

103
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.840
<v Speaker 2>It never plays a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

104
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>well it big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm auteurs and that's not true.</v>

105
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing this very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gorgeous.</v>

106
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Now please tell us what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

107
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 2>What is a good a printer that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>playful.</v>

108
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 2>What about that gorgeous gorilla with </v>
<v Speaker 2>night eyes?</v>

109
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I saw her on Gogglebox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

110
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 2>gorillas are a good example of they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not predators.</v>

111
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 2>They're vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>

112
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>They continue to play throughout their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime like humans do.</v>

113
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Like artists do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dogs do.</v>

114
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Most mammals play in juvenile period and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they're learning.</v>

115
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.244
<v Speaker 2>We've got these massive brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this extended period of being </v>

116
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 2>juveniles when we're training those big </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains up and this is all mammals and we</v>

117
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>we learned mostly play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not entirely,</v>

118
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.844
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of the structures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then in adulthood most mammals stop and </v>

119
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.523
<v Speaker 2>a handful carry on like our dogs auteurs</v>
<v Speaker 2>other primates doing this playful </v>

120
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:19.744
<v Speaker 2>behavior and what you find is that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior like laughter starts having a </v>

121
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 2>relatively simple role.</v>

122
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>It's social bonding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's playfulness,</v>

123
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and then as we get older it becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more complex tool.</v>

124
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>By the time you were an adult and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing laughter,</v>

125
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a hall of mirrors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

126
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:36.454
<v Speaker 2>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be laughing because there </v>

127
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:37.654
<v Speaker 2>helplessly laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be laughing because they're </v>

128
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed because they're frightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're trying to cover up being</v>

129
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:42.364
<v Speaker 2>angry because they trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like them because they're in </v>

130
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:45.154
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Studied all these different reasons why </v>

131
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:47.614
<v Speaker 2>laughter starts to appear around you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in an interaction with </v>

132
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're normally pretty good,</v>

133
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 2>normally pretty good at reading that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's often when you're inhale,</v>

134
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.883
<v Speaker 2>after going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of something that has maybe </v>

135
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.370
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

136
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they laughing?</v>

137
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Listen to them laughing and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>those pigs,</v>

138
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they love?</v>

139
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:06.723
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

140
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually even worse,</v>

141
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>you think they're laughing at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

142
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.123
<v Speaker 2>because that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I included in this lover and my </v>

143
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 2>explanation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The love.</v>

144
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

145
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 2>You're always thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always meaningful.</v>

146
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's got apparently nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with you,</v>

147
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.764
<v Speaker 2>you will pay some attention to laughter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try and work out what's going on </v>

148
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 2>because it is such a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

149
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that laughter is vocal </v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonverbal.</v>

150
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 2>That is sort of a sort of super </v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic is beyond language life,</v>

151
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.363
<v Speaker 2>it's what you look to to communicate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations where language isn't of use </v>

152
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>to you to try to connect to people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it after.</v>

153
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this it sits with a set of things</v>

154
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:40.544
<v Speaker 2>called non verbal emotional expressions </v>
<v Speaker 2>which are more like animal calls and </v>

155
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 2>they are like speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm talking to you now I'm doing</v>

156
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 2>something no other no other animal can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do in nature I you,</v>

157
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

158
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 2>When we talk to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce this incredible sound that </v>

159
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.033
<v Speaker 2>starts down at a rib cage and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sounds at our voice box of them </v>

160
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>is shaped that with our tongue and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lips and our jaw and that's.</v>

161
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.163
<v Speaker 2>This gives us this sound literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>unparalleled in nature and then when we </v>

162
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 2>are in a really pretty extreme emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

163
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:07.724
<v Speaker 2>we don't bother with that at all and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just squeeze the air out and we make </v>

164
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:10.694
<v Speaker 2>screams and grunts and sounds all </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughter and they're really much more </v>

165
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:14.444
<v Speaker 2>basic sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen now sometimes when I'm talking </v>

166
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>to people to hear the sort of noises </v>
<v Speaker 2>they make.</v>

167
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 2>There aren't words like a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 2>paragraph,</v>

168
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.553
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just up to there when he made that </v>

169
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 2>little grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

170
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is odd and I know we signaling,</v>

171
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glean availability,</v>

172
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 2>power status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on,</v>

173
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.370
<v Speaker 2>professor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>

174
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a rather unfortunately named </v>
<v Speaker 2>term called back channeling,</v>

175
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 2>which means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

176
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I know it fairly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid.</v>

177
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I began back channeling on my 17th </v>
<v Speaker 2>birthday,</v>

178
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 2>never called again.</v>

179
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>What it means is people show that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>listing,</v>

180
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>so they tend to make little noises they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might make loves,</v>

181
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.083
<v Speaker 2>but they also make all sorts of noises </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm here and I'm engaged with </v>

182
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

183
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.643
<v Speaker 2>icontact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using it to indicate that I'm </v>

184
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.263
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might also use it to indicate I'm </v>

185
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 2>ready to speak to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

186
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

187
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.473
<v Speaker 2>we don't sit and receive messages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then start emitting them at somebody </v>

188
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:12.974
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We we speak to be understood and we </v>

189
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:15.734
<v Speaker 2>listened to show that we're following </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's making funny noises can be </v>

190
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.064
<v Speaker 2>part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinary what's happening </v>

191
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Speaker 2>beyond the understood signifiers within </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

192
00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 2>whenever you hear that thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of communication is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonverbal,</v>

195
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.343
<v Speaker 2>how can it be if someone's doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech for a guy and we're going to be </v>

196
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>raising taxes by this amount.</v>

197
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not freaking my attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those eyebrows you have.</v>

198
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>So thinking the information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going across,</v>

199
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:43.970
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely is,</v>

200
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.804
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that as soon as you </v>

201
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 2>have a person talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is never just the words.</v>

202
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.930
<v Speaker 2>There's always a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

203
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>And you do get a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>information from that voice.</v>

204
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this this morning.</v>

205
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sex pistols and that,</v>

206
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God save the Queen and that came out.</v>

207
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

208
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>this is so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they keep going,</v>

209
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we love the queen.</v>

210
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think they might.</v>

211
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a loaded voice.</v>

212
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I was just,</v>

213
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre pubescent at that time it seemed </v>

214
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.254
<v Speaker 2>incredibly threatening because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely pretty certainly don't have </v>

215
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.314
<v Speaker 2>the queen at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was all coming from how it's </v>

216
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:27.504
<v Speaker 2>phrased and how it's being used in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sound that's contributing to the </v>

217
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.624
<v Speaker 2>noise that they're making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I came into this area working on </v>

218
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I worked on language.</v>

219
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.330
<v Speaker 2>That was what I would tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did languages well eat.</v>

220
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.193
<v Speaker 2>But even even that was made when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>started scanning brains and you could </v>

221
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 2>find all these brain areas that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to,</v>

222
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words that you understand and all </v>

223
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:51.834
<v Speaker 2>the linguistic stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also got all these other brain </v>

224
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 2>areas that don't care at all about </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

225
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 2>but they absolutely care about someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it.</v>

226
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And of course they're always there if </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone speaking,</v>

227
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as there's a voice,</v>

228
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:04.894
<v Speaker 2>as another channel of information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are processing really strongly and </v>

229
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.040
<v Speaker 2>the brain cares at least as much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as it does about the words in terms</v>

230
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 2>of activation.</v>

231
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Because if I think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to suddenly be turned into </v>

232
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>an austere mail from like sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>

233
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:26.570
<v Speaker 1>who was just saying the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>content to me in this world,</v>

234
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course love to bond.</v>

235
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I think having a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

236
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's all sorts of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aesthetic data,</v>

237
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.923
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what is contained in the voice is </v>

238
00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:41.980
<v Speaker 1>communicating in a powerful way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason that I didn't understand,</v>

239
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of information is nonverbal.</v>

240
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.183
<v Speaker 1>It's because I'm precisely unaware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I'm being affected by sound </v>

241
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.760
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know how to categorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

242
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's language is about what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being said.</v>

243
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:55.414
<v Speaker 1>It's about distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this and not this and it's </v>

244
00:10:57.401 --> 00:10:59.680
<v Speaker 1>easy to categorize and understand less </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

245
00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:00.514
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as these aspects of communication that </v>

246
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.560
<v Speaker 1>are non not vocabulary.</v>

247
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 2>You're super linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

248
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 2>They don't directly influence what your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The words necessarily that you're saying</v>

249
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 2>all the can interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you,</v>

250
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 2>soon as you hear a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a person,</v>

251
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good idea at agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good shot is an age,</v>

252
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical origins,</v>

253
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.133
<v Speaker 2>mood health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very empowering and it's also </v>

254
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.273
<v Speaker 2>aspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People talk in a way that they want </v>

255
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 2>people to see them as like when I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been on the phone to my mum,</v>

256
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I taught like my mum for about half an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour afterwards and you know,</v>

257
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 2>loved my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really want to sound like it,</v>

258
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm showing all this stuff about our</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

259
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I started talking to her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us do that all the time.</v>

260
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking differently to you now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm trying</v>

261
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>to project a particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

262
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.790
<v Speaker 1>World?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping it's competent scientists.</v>

263
00:11:58.791 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping I'm probably landing on it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more.</v>

264
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Sophie Scott and so much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

265
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.873
<v Speaker 1>what we're projecting onto the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we want to be received and </v>

266
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:10.234
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of laughter somehow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement to that or a disruption to </v>

267
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:13.894
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

268
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it can be both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of the time it's something that</v>

269
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 1>you're actively using to try and effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

270
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.054
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the cheap last week and not </v>

271
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:25.894
<v Speaker 1>particularly full tube coming away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heathrow and there was a suitcase with </v>

272
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:28.624
<v Speaker 1>no one anywhere near and I suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized I was unattended suitcase so </v>

273
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.530
<v Speaker 1>and there were empty seats by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

274
00:12:33.531 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 1>how many happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>they all know I'm gonna have to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so.</v>

276
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

277
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.583
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

278
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

279
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.773
<v Speaker 1>people I'm with going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

280
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 1>she's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

281
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>is this anybody suitcase?</v>

282
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's one right at the other end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the character goes,</v>

283
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mine.</v>

284
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 1>And she came there and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was saying,</v>

285
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>oh sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that become available.</v>

286
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:51.701
<v Speaker 1>And I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

287
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were both laughing to kind of go,</v>

288
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>this is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not telling you off.</v>

289
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 1>No one's crossed with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all right here.</v>

290
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Signaling to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is cool.</v>

291
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.553
<v Speaker 1>This is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have the external reference that </v>

292
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>an unattended bag could mean death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in that context.</v>

293
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have seen people get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>told off or unattended luggage so you </v>

294
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're both trying to make it clear we're</v>

295
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 1>not doing that and she's also very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

296
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.823
<v Speaker 1>but in fact that is a really nuanced use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of laughter that people that that was </v>

297
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:18.660
<v Speaker 1>not helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughter.</v>

298
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I was not in any sense of mused entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and make it better,</v>

299
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>less threatening.</v>

300
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>It was an expression of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>

301
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

302
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's the process.</v>

303
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.274
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go now this isn't a terrorist </v>

304
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:31.984
<v Speaker 1>attack on the tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that your social interaction </v>

305
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:34.804
<v Speaker 1>has not failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has not been misinterpreted that </v>

306
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you've successfully communicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

307
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm another concerned person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

308
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 1>we're all good here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people,</v>

309
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>if that goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course love to can suddenly be really</v>

310
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate and you do encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where people will be like,</v>

311
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.861
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

312
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're laughing at me.</v>

313
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.383
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Goodfellas or it's an awful </v>

314
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>

315
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It makes your blood run cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does happen quite a lot.</v>

316
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>That's basically a continuum in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever suffered.</v>

317
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Let the rhythm section of my life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people going,</v>

318
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to be funny mate.</v>

319
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>What's that then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's awful.</v>

320
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.143
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that it actually in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric of a violent conflict and we </v>

321
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 1>try them and expert like the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you're trying to be funny.</v>

322
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.393
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you're funny that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a bit of language that </v>

323
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:18.600
<v Speaker 1>comes up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

324
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's undercutting,</v>

325
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course humor is disrupting their.</v>

326
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.453
<v Speaker 1>Say there's a standard frequency of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Banal exchange of information with </v>

327
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:31.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever independent personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflections you have as your default.</v>

328
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Then humor is subverting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

329
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm in here too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to introduce some sort of jackets,</v>

330
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.204
<v Speaker 1>spikes all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another person for power can </v>

331
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:39.964
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

332
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 1>this isn't funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I don't like that feeling at all.</v>

333
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I've made myself nervous just talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

334
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Quite a lot of the behaviors that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughter and yawning,</v>

336
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.030
<v Speaker 1>blinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contagious.</v>

337
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Most of the blinks you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to do your blinks.</v>

338
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Blinks were blinking our lives away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pointlessly thing.</v>

339
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 2>If you watch a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

340
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't do this because we should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We learn contagious behaviors.</v>

341
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:04.874
<v Speaker 2>We learn to pick them up from people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughed is a really big one to watch my </v>

342
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do watch her.</v>

343
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 2>She don't blink very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually bloody exhausting.</v>

344
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 2>She won't have any blinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with laughter with the baby,</v>

345
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

346
00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:17.464
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well if I got turned around like that </v>

347
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she loves all that.</v>

348
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves sort of monster play and </v>

349
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:23.280
<v Speaker 2>biting and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Hard.</v>

350
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.163
<v Speaker 2>Not they're not aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like that there is a </v>

351
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:26.504
<v Speaker 2>function and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I think about what is my </v>

352
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.223
<v Speaker 2>impetus to initiate that behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it recognizing she doesn't yet have </v>

353
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:34.484
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to feel bonded to her and I </v>

354
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.913
<v Speaker 2>want to feel closeness to her and I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to touch her and staff so that place </v>

355
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the function of a,</v>

356
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 2>of reiterating and compounding our </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>

357
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this very interesting.</v>

358
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>It is quite striking that we laughed so </v>
<v Speaker 2>early.</v>

359
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

360
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 2>we can cry pretty soon as soon as we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>

361
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:56.504
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are born about three months too </v>

362
00:15:57.201 --> 00:16:01.790
<v Speaker 2>soon because of our massive heads and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then around the time we would be born we</v>

363
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:02.624
<v Speaker 2>start laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so probably it should have been there </v>

364
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:05.174
<v Speaker 2>right from the outset and then ages </v>
<v Speaker 2>later we start making other sounds and </v>

365
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.253
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting that the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that comes in is this incredibly </v>

366
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:16.811
<v Speaker 2>potent positive vocalization because </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies don't catch laughs from adults,</v>

367
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:17.894
<v Speaker 2>but the adults love when the babies love</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you start teaching them about it </v>

368
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:21.044
<v Speaker 2>starts becoming an interaction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very nice evidence that well </v>

369
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 2>before babies are linguistic in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that they can speak at all.</v>

370
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 2>They're probably understanding a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't do anything vocal.</v>

371
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.963
<v Speaker 2>They will pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their parents laughed and they will </v>

372
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 2>start doing things to make their parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

373
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.873
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because of this communicative </v>
<v Speaker 2>linkedin is giving in this interaction </v>

374
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 2>that it gives you so long before you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having conversations.</v>

375
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Babies are using laughter as actively as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using love to now to,</v>

376
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 2>to drive interactions with you</v>

377
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.860
<v Speaker 1>more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of my baby and me,</v>

378
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:52.694
<v Speaker 1>she's a very funny trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what I'm thinking then is that </v>

379
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.403
<v Speaker 1>there is power in laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is power in laughter as a form of </v>

380
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 1>communication and barefoot comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is power in it.</v>

381
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.783
<v Speaker 1>So like I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we've done some pre </v>

382
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 1>production here and that's very rare for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

383
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>We've got a like examples of politicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>using humor and uh,</v>

384
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:13.694
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we can analyze this is part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our podcast because we are </v>

385
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>professionals now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cenk or you'll have to make sure that we</v>

386
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can play into that mic.</v>

387
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>What Mike is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're on Mike,</v>

388
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

389
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 1>what's that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gower.</v>

390
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Does that make it go on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to play in there?</v>

391
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>But will we actually able to hear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room?</v>

392
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I wonder even growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just.</v>

393
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.234
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is the first person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's using humor is just sort of a </v>

394
00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>comedy staple of the British political </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

395
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.333
<v Speaker 1>It's Boris Johnson using humans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate 14 to try and bikes to </v>

396
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Holland boomerangs to Australia sands </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports of,</v>

397
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.983
<v Speaker 1>but we do still export wine to Italy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm delighted to say Nigel farage to </v>

398
00:17:56.731 --> 00:18:01.731
<v Speaker 1>America now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boris Johnson,</v>

399
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.623
<v Speaker 1>I think is a really good example because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of the things that </v>

400
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:06.470
<v Speaker 1>human does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Izzy,</v>

401
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I think signals and awareness of another</v>
<v Speaker 1>seam of communication.</v>

402
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're using comedy,</v>

403
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.453
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that on one level we're having </v>

404
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:17.364
<v Speaker 1>this discourse like eat there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boris Johnson is given a speech in some </v>

405
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:20.604
<v Speaker 1>sort of context like business and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics species to the next selling </v>

406
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 1>sand to the Arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a racist trope actually,</v>

407
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.374
<v Speaker 1>but he found a way of have taken out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most obvious racism and making a dog </v>

408
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 1>whistle racism.</v>

409
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 1>One of his great skills actually Boris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson and uh,</v>

410
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's like he's being deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 1>humorous.</v>

411
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Boris Johnson is doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

412
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.083
<v Speaker 1>If I'm absolutely honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Boris Johnson is very carefully </v>

413
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.414
<v Speaker 1>cultivated a kind of clownish persona to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover up a tremendously powerfully </v>

414
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.533
<v Speaker 1>interested in success politician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there was a very interesting essay </v>

415
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>by Jonathan Coe pointing out that Doris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson didn't used to be funny.</v>

416
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He used to be just the Pashto in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

417
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.100
<v Speaker 1>It was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this,</v>

418
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.963
<v Speaker 1>here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another privileged individual from </v>

419
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Eaton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was on,</v>

420
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.650
<v Speaker 1>have I got news for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

421
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first time he was on,</v>

422
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his lap,</v>

423
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.370
<v Speaker 1>kept having a go at him about a phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>call he'd had with the journalists could</v>

424
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 1>turn to someone called diaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gfi was trying to get the details out of</v>

425
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Johnson and Johnson doesn't get mad with</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well and his just would not come by</v>

426
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.350
<v Speaker 1>way from.</v>

427
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.183
<v Speaker 1>It kept coming back to Katelyn back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the end I think Paul Martin </v>

428
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.423
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you got a bit bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a joke about it and that was funny </v>

429
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and the audience laughed and it somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously got Boris Johnson off the</v>

430
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:40.340
<v Speaker 1>hook and somehow the laughter stuck to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him not to pull them out.</v>

431
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 1>And He'd actually made the joke that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Batman when Batman was in that cave</v>

432
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 1>of bat and became Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm funny,</v>

433
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm funny,</v>

434
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever have to reveal my mackie </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually in self interest and a huge </v>

435
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 1>political ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just laugh my way to the top or at</v>

436
00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:58.794
<v Speaker 1>least to the middle and that certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Jonathan Co makes quite a good </v>

437
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 1>argument for that which I think contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of weight and it certainly needs.</v>

438
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>It points out that the laughter kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding Boris Johnson,</v>

439
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 1>he understands very well.</v>

440
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.403
<v Speaker 1>He knows it's not a sign that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking deeply about his intentions </v>

441
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.593
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes easy to teach them as a joke </v>

442
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 1>and then he can use to a certain extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a double edge sword,</v>

443
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 1>but you are licensed to do different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

444
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:20.994
<v Speaker 1>If people treat you as funny and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works for you and it can work against </v>

445
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you and he's been very good at making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>work for him.</v>

446
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>He really has because they're so things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

447
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those allegations about his private life</v>

448
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:31.854
<v Speaker 1>that blokey sort of lost his way out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of lots of contentious decisions </v>

449
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:35.514
<v Speaker 1>made while mayor fancy sort of like he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse or this brexit stuff and now </v>

450
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:39.414
<v Speaker 1>he's repositioning as sort of an attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog for the conservatives in this </v>

451
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 1>election with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I noticed,</v>

452
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:44.574
<v Speaker 1>he said that he's got beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's obviously incredibly </v>

453
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:47.394
<v Speaker 1>intelligent man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly inexpensively educated man </v>

454
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and when he sort of contrived an insult </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mutton headed mug one lot,</v>

455
00:20:53.311 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that's beautiful.</v>

456
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Bit of language is a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good attack.</v>

457
00:20:56.681 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And like all good comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a sort of a specific revelation</v>

458
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and a specific intent is a cervic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacerating piece of language that.</v>

459
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

460
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I feel that when he's doing that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a great power in it.</v>

461
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:11.831
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've seen the summit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boris Johnson's Korea and luck on what's</v>

463
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.114
<v Speaker 1>happening across the water is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indication that there's this type of </v>

464
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>charm and charisma is a useful way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaining power.</v>

465
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.833
<v Speaker 1>Django,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we put up an American one now just </v>

466
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 1>for the purposes of keeping some balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put that mic up again.</v>

467
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So this is what this is this Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump being funny.</v>

468
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Obama or trump or Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

469
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:36.304
<v Speaker 1>Well funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good because he's charismatic as </v>

470
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:39.730
<v Speaker 1>all hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good looking.</v>

471
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I liked Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie's and guy.</v>

472
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.753
<v Speaker 3>Apparently some folks really want to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pot smoking socialist in the White </v>

473
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:48.923
<v Speaker 3>House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could get a third Obama term after </v>

474
00:21:51.381 --> 00:21:52.214
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

475
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.020
<v Speaker 1>So Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice little joke there.</v>

476
00:21:58.021 --> 00:21:58.854
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>

477
00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a scripted joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

478
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a very sort of clear where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

479
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Once he says pot smoking socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's playing on his own,</v>

480
00:22:09.481 --> 00:22:10.314
<v Speaker 1>sort of like public awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think Barack Barack Obama's isn't </v>

481
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.643
<v Speaker 1>an excellent politician and he states </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally and humorous in a way that </v>

482
00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:19.170
<v Speaker 1>doesn't diminish the state is I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say Boris Johnson.</v>

483
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 1>He sort of pays a kind of an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>price,</v>

484
00:22:21.151 --> 00:22:25.500
<v Speaker 1>vichy mode that's just more perhaps more</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do political stance.</v>

485
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

486
00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be being unfair here,</v>

487
00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>but the Nigel Farrage joke though was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a not funny,</v>

488
00:22:31.761 --> 00:22:32.810
<v Speaker 2>not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not funny,</v>

489
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 2>isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

490
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

491
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people love audience.</v>

492
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Laughter is highly sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to tell you this,</v>

493
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:41.384
<v Speaker 2>but people will laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People laughing as they do in </v>

494
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.450
<v Speaker 2>conversations to show that they approve </v>
<v Speaker 2>or they agree or they understand or they</v>

495
00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:49.280
<v Speaker 2>remember or they've noticed something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 2>as much as it is to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

497
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 2>and I'm definitely not saying it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>amusement,</v>

498
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.203
<v Speaker 2>but the knowledge of project was a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a here is that in in the same </v>

499
00:22:56.991 --> 00:22:57.824
<v Speaker 2>way people up until recently used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce it and there's Donald Trump in </v>

500
00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:02.620
<v Speaker 2>itself is a punchline and larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a punchline.</v>

501
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.463
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the Obama joke and I fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted may well have been written for </v>

502
00:23:05.631 --> 00:23:06.464
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his self depreciating and slightly more </v>

503
00:23:09.411 --> 00:23:11.210
<v Speaker 2>complex in terms of the structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

504
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a funny thing.</v>

505
00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Will laugh at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be biased by as we all are,</v>

506
00:23:16.401 --> 00:23:20.360
<v Speaker 2>when we're appraising humor about </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal feelings here and that's it,</v>

507
00:23:20.361 --> 00:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>but I'm interested in Obama because in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocally he just,</v>

508
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.050
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's articulate and he used his rhetoric</v>

509
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.033
<v Speaker 2>beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beautiful speaker and he's April </v>

510
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 2>of capable of dropping into humor at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right time,</v>

511
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.890
<v Speaker 2>in the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that it's done well.</v>

512
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.550
<v Speaker 2>So he kind of excels in how it uses his </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice and he's made humor.</v>

513
00:23:40.551 --> 00:23:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although one of the things,</v>

514
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the things</v>

515
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.033
<v Speaker 1>he was also doing in that drug and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>not stupid perhaps to do with your area </v>

516
00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:45.794
<v Speaker 1>of or certainly not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like he's also diminishing the </v>

517
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.974
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I imagine the point that you made </v>

518
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the point that I don't know when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech was happening,</v>

519
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:53.624
<v Speaker 1>but clearly it was the point when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were undetermined on who would be the </v>

520
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.470
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.</v>

521
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:58.304
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting that sanders is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point used as the punchline of a </v>

522
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

523
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.243
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between comedy and power </v>

524
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.234
<v Speaker 1>and I'm very interested as someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been ridiculed for entering the public </v>

525
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 1>political sphere out of a comedic </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

526
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:19.090
<v Speaker 1>How actually in reality the people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>power often used comedy and humor to get</v>

527
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:24.040
<v Speaker 1>what they want and to create the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressions that they want.</v>

528
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Should we have a listen to Nigel farrage</v>
<v Speaker 1>being funny now because he's,</v>

529
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.820
<v Speaker 1>he's another politician that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

530
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't sort of whether or not </v>

531
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:32.564
<v Speaker 1>you agree with people's politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there the power of their tree and </v>

532
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that their ability to have an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that sort of,</v>

533
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in humor is something that we have </v>

534
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 1>to take seriously and then we've got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister</v>

535
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>or should I call him in this context?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piggy in the middle.</v>

536
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good joke.</v>

537
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously that's a joke that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that when David Cameron,</v>

538
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.253
<v Speaker 1>as we know that the former prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister put his genitals into a pig's </v>

539
00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:05.154
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the prime minister of a </v>

540
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:08.850
<v Speaker 1>country putting his genitals in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth of a dead pig there.</v>

541
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.901
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

542
00:25:09.901 --> 00:25:11.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

543
00:25:11.341 --> 00:25:12.270
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Raj,</v>

544
00:25:12.271 --> 00:25:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an interesting case because</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that humans being used</v>

545
00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:18.000
<v Speaker 1>for in all of these cases is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

546
00:25:18.001 --> 00:25:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like one another.</v>

547
00:25:20.011 --> 00:25:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on the other side of some chasm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of puppeteering you and using power.</v>

548
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

549
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.333
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some element of sharing their people </v>

550
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:29.634
<v Speaker 1>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people don't agree with you or don't </v>

551
00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:32.700
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't laugh,</v>

552
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

553
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that that's happened to me before</v>

554
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>

555
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:39.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I can think of comedians obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you,</v>

557
00:25:41.371 --> 00:25:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but I can think of comedians that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never see something about them.</v>

558
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't like them and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what they'd have to do </v>

559
00:25:47.911 --> 00:25:49.620
<v Speaker 1>to make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's just me making it place.</v>

560
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.513
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally nothing to do with them </v>

561
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.883
<v Speaker 1>entirely to do with my biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will affect my behavior around </v>

562
00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:56.370
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can appreciate,</v>

563
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with frauds,</v>

564
00:25:57.391 --> 00:26:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I can recognize the structure of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke and how well it's gone down,</v>

565
00:26:00.421 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still not smiling because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.450
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like voices.</v>

567
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It's about who I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be part of that human.</v>

568
00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be sharing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>

569
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong element of sharing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>

570
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's being used.</v>

571
00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even the word communicator means</v>

572
00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:17.710
<v Speaker 1>creator of community creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiances.</v>

573
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.830
<v Speaker 1>You're communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not one.</v>

574
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:20.723
<v Speaker 1>We are many that are bonded and I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Moore that are graphic artists </v>

575
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:26.010
<v Speaker 1>saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

576
00:26:26.011 --> 00:26:26.844
<v Speaker 1>they use like spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we spell that there's a magic in </v>

577
00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:29.910
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

578
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.390
<v Speaker 1>You can create feelings in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person through what you say.</v>

579
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is a powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing idea to me.</v>

580
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at this time I suppose it's sort of </v>

581
00:26:40.771 --> 00:26:42.750
<v Speaker 1>a pact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a postmodern phenomena?</v>

582
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not qualified to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're sort of seeing an emergence of</v>

583
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>a different type of politician and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>its apex I think is Donald Trump.</v>

584
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.533
<v Speaker 1>And I'd like to talk about him and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of humor and his ability to </v>

585
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 1>communicate because this is a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of difficult to say,</v>

586
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:58.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'll ask anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

587
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

588
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>he's personally attacked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

589
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally I've got,</v>

590
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.370
<v Speaker 1>we use it in my standup show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth.</v>

591
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.383
<v Speaker 1>There's like huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bit of him guard Russell </v>

592
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.053
<v Speaker 1>Brand Byron Idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like naming me and attacking </v>

593
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before he was president actually.</v>

594
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.823
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

595
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:14.853
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of what I like about Donald </v>

596
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 1>trump is a sentence that's not easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish,</v>

597
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.560
<v Speaker 1>is that he's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of certainty.</v>

598
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And like there's something I think quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>likable sort of shrugging.</v>

599
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:31.224
<v Speaker 1>He always seems like he's shrugging off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find it sort of interesting when </v>

600
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:36.414
<v Speaker 1>things are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because I suppose my particular take </v>

601
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 1>on politics is that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concealment,</v>

602
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>a lack of transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone like Donald Trump,</v>

603
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:46.111
<v Speaker 1>I sort of think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

604
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a plainness of bovine </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviousness.</v>

605
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather enjoying that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being revealed that shouldn't be.</v>

606
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.173
<v Speaker 1>And things are being concealed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be like the top of his </v>

607
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:56.541
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

608
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a listen to.</v>

609
00:27:58.351 --> 00:27:59.184
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a listen to Donald Trump </v>

610
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 1>saying saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got it there.</v>

611
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Django Hillary</v>

612
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 4>accidentally bumped into me and she very</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilly said,</v>

613
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 4>pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the first time ever,</v>

614
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.153
<v Speaker 4>ever that Hillary is sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking to major corporate leaders and </v>

615
00:28:26.001 --> 00:28:26.834
<v Speaker 4>not getting paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The media is even more bias this year </v>

616
00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:32.580
<v Speaker 4>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

617
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Michelle Obama gives a speech and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone loves it.</v>

618
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:43.520
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think she's absolutely great.</v>

619
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.010
<v Speaker 4>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Melania gives the exact same.</v>

620
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.323
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best joke because he's the </v>

621
00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:57.140
<v Speaker 1>victim of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so self effacing.</v>

622
00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA.</v>

623
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dangerous.</v>

624
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.493
<v Speaker 1>Now this has been an argument like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second one was obviously in front of </v>

625
00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He criticized there again accurately.</v>

626
00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

627
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:07.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.473
<v Speaker 1>communicative skills become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important in a time when there's a lack </v>

629
00:29:11.031 --> 00:29:11.920
<v Speaker 1>of trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

630
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.793
<v Speaker 1>talking about people generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like the politics doesn't serve </v>

631
00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:16.790
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that democracy doesn't serve them.</v>

632
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.773
<v Speaker 1>If someone turns up that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable or appealing in a way that's </v>

633
00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:22.300
<v Speaker 1>surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

634
00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:25.230
<v Speaker 1>so it has a particular impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was there?</v>

635
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.530
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's certainly has.</v>

636
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.473
<v Speaker 1>He has quite a strange voice because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do a lot of the things that </v>

637
00:29:31.821 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 1>people kind of get pushed towards in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquor.</v>

638
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.773
<v Speaker 1>Certainly for British and I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be a provider that obviously I </v>

639
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.460
<v Speaker 1>don't understand American accents in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way,</v>

640
00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't sound communication.</v>

641
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.733
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like he's given them </v>
<v Speaker 1>any insight into perhaps don't do that </v>

642
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:48.940
<v Speaker 1>strange high pitched thing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going for a job,</v>

643
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know he's because he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high pitched voice and he sounded,</v>

644
00:29:51.351 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

645
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.863
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit nicer with there some </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction going on in there and it's </v>

646
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it,</v>

647
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:58.330
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a quite a,</v>

648
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 1>quite a limited range of 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>

649
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music of your voice and we go in and</v>

650
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:06.694
<v Speaker 1>out of fashion is unlocking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remember back to when Neil </v>

651
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.343
<v Speaker 1>Kinnock did that amazing speech about </v>
<v Speaker 1>militant and the grotesque chaos will </v>

652
00:30:14.301 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes a little lever counseling.</v>

653
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just a beautiful piece of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

654
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:19.470
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

655
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

656
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the music of his voice is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>

657
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Is furious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely furious.</v>

658
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's gone largely out of fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't find in u k political rhetoric</v>

659
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 1>that that kind of use and the voice in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way because it sounds hysterical.</v>

660
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I bet it doesn't sound managed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>managerial bureaucratically.</v>

661
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.543
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that came in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Blair and actually Debbie Cameron </v>

662
00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 1>fully did this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that kind of like,</v>

663
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just having a chat sort of </v>

664
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you now.</v>

665
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 1>This is because you can trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is new labor.</v>

666
00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.343
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just actually just saying stuff </v>

667
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.001
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

668
00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was sort of,</v>

669
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it was my friend Adam Curtis says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

670
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of Clinton and Blair was </v>

671
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 1>heralding of a sort of a managerial type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of politics.</v>

672
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 1>We're just managers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we are,</v>

673
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:14.490
<v Speaker 1>we like middle managers at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

674
00:31:14.491 --> 00:31:16.020
<v Speaker 1>We're not sort of powerful demagogues.</v>

675
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.810
<v Speaker 1>We're not sort of people that are would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like them.</v>

676
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.683
<v Speaker 1>It's not like an outfit that punching </v>
<v Speaker 1>above his weight there from the podium </v>

677
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:22.114
<v Speaker 1>fishing the skies and roaring like as </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just meekly giving you data and </v>

678
00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 1>quite an affable way now like Tony Blair</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to grow ever more presidential</v>

679
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:31.714
<v Speaker 1>while damning his own party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that point it was like there was </v>

680
00:31:34.641 --> 00:31:37.090
<v Speaker 1>a kind of an unaccessible ordinariness </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

681
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:37.983
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and it was obviously it's conveyed </v>

682
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:39.964
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really big part of how he </v>

683
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 1>spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware that there's that phrase isn't</v>

684
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a man with a hammer,</v>

685
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:49.540
<v Speaker 1>everything looks like a nail and I bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything down to voices except there's</v>

686
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 1>other stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in that,</v>

687
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 1>in that context you can even sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing Obama was returning,</v>

688
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:56.563
<v Speaker 1>it had elements of a more kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical rhetoric in his style and the </v>

689
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 1>way he uses voice and your point to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

690
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:02.883
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that he was afforded a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of exoticism because the </v>

691
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:05.674
<v Speaker 1>narrative that is present presidency was</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American and there's always an </v>

692
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.024
<v Speaker 1>American politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that that is an inclusion from </v>

693
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.083
<v Speaker 1>outside of the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using that to inflate the idea that the </v>

694
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Speaker 1>popular mainstream is ethical look after</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

695
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.213
<v Speaker 1>we've got an African American president </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose as if he had a different </v>

696
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:25.684
<v Speaker 1>type of vocal license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about different kinds of </v>

697
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 1>political license because there are sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different constraints.</v>

698
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a particular issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting that you had more.</v>

699
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:34.750
<v Speaker 1>What was that word again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

700
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.673
<v Speaker 1>he's just got a bit rhetorical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President used the music of his voice </v>

701
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose it was also</v>

702
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.813
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Deborah Cameron's done some work on </v>

703
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:46.450
<v Speaker 2>this woman from Oxford University </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor at Oxford University and she's</v>

704
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.770
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at.</v>

705
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.513
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at a gang culture and you </v>

706
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 2>get a very particular linguistic use for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

707
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:57.524
<v Speaker 2>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people use that to mark their </v>

708
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.023
<v Speaker 2>membership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at female members of gangs </v>

709
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 2>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will very often be the most kind of</v>

710
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:07.223
<v Speaker 2>like classic users of the slang because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be other stuff they can't </v>

711
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:12.314
<v Speaker 2>get involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can get the words right and </v>

712
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.733
<v Speaker 2>it's marking your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deserve to be here because I'm doing </v>

713
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:18.404
<v Speaker 2>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if Obama had been less formal </v>

714
00:33:20.691 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 2>in his speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would be more like,</v>

715
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll just can't do this at all.</v>

716
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

717
00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:25.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was marking I deserve to be here and </v>

718
00:33:26.701 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I can damn well you into this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps held to a higher standard.</v>

719
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my voice now.</v>

720
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It's killing me as you can hear what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

721
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Like Donald Trump sounds a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangulated and sort of,</v>

722
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

723
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:41.294
<v Speaker 2>sap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he very much positioned himself as </v>

724
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm draining the swamp.</v>

725
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Every said I'm going to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to mix stuff up.</v>

726
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:48.674
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even on a vocal quality like the voice </v>

727
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 2>is interesting isn't because the voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways is a ghost in the machine,</v>

728
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.600
<v Speaker 2>is the vibration of the vocal cords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't actually there at all.</v>

729
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Your Voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your inhabited by this thing.</v>

730
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So isn't there something essential about</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice?</v>

731
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:02.510
<v Speaker 2>This is part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

732
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:03.523
<v Speaker 2>essence who you are or vocalist who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are at your core or your soul or </v>

733
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:07.634
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

734
00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a real truthiness devices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

735
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got here,</v>

736
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I was nervous and I was aware when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed picking to jen and when I first</v>

737
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:16.844
<v Speaker 2>met you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could hear the tension in my voice </v>

738
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 2>because it absolutely you can't get with</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to get past it.</v>

739
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:22.243
<v Speaker 2>It must be crippling to know that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about vocal communication and then to </v>

740
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 2>still be subject to rules that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond that kind of regulation.</v>

741
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 2>And I'll know what the hell is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline doing?</v>

742
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Some of vocal folds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's um,</v>

743
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just true.</v>

744
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:35.774
<v Speaker 2>So if you are in an emotional state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it affects your body and your voice is </v>

745
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 2>being made by your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds stupid,</v>

746
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:42.974
<v Speaker 2>but if I don't use my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't know anything about what I </v>

747
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 2>sound like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do something.</v>

748
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It's an action as much as it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

749
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:49.960
<v Speaker 2>the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's uh,</v>

750
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get information from my facebook</v>

751
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:54.110
<v Speaker 2>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was asleep,</v>

752
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:54.944
<v Speaker 2>I was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My face doesn't need to do things for </v>

753
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you to take a picture of you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

754
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.933
<v Speaker 2>This has gone very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in touch with the coroner was </v>

755
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.990
<v Speaker 2>really silent witness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

756
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.441
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

757
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to do something for a voice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be there.</v>

758
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:11.264
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say it's this weird ephemeral thing </v>

759
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much and it's so.</v>

760
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And it can be an incredibly strong tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your emotional state and while it can</v>

761
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 2>be very hard to work around so because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was what it can,</v>

762
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 2>what it can do to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's revealing.</v>

763
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So the more sort of masking techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>and manipulative techniques that you can</v>

764
00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:32.474
<v Speaker 2>get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better,</v>

765
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>but I suppose the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>

766
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 2>in a way that is hard to hold up an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute standard because</v>

767
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.993
<v Speaker 1>like in other areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Bama is being judged in a </v>

768
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:43.160
<v Speaker 1>different way to Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigel farrage,</v>

769
00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 1>he's being charged in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

770
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to make Theresa May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

771
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 1>a bloody horrible voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three to my haven't being funny,</v>

772
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:52.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's no sort of gargly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strangley,</v>

773
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.860
<v Speaker 1>post-coital sort of warble oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in there.</v>

774
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't like much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

775
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very immediate.</v>

776
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.573
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to judge voices outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything else you know about </v>

777
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:07.180
<v Speaker 1>somebody so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

778
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a difficult part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying isn't evil voice.</v>

779
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 1>He's got that kind of cracked bell </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

780
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:13.644
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like she's striving to do </v>

781
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:19.030
<v Speaker 1>something with a voice that she's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite landing on and that's not.</v>

782
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.030
<v Speaker 1>But she's having them lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

783
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:22.660
<v Speaker 1>when people get really famous that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

784
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stop talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

785
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 1>your prime minister now.</v>

786
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:31.783
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to Margaret Thatcher now </v>

787
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:37.800
<v Speaker 1>because she was told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressly told you,</v>

788
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 1>speak to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak with pitch to two eyes,</v>

789
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 1>speak lower men with men won't take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

790
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and when you listen to an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can hear is the effort.</v>

791
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 1>She's taking a voice down to somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she probably didn't really want to</v>

792
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:49.800
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the majority of the argument.</v>

793
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You hear the falseness for like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

794
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even catch the lowdown as the,</v>

795
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.520
<v Speaker 1>she again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

796
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I didn't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these things.</v>

797
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.153
<v Speaker 1>So the very fact that so much effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>expended on it means that it is a real </v>

798
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge factor.</v>

799
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

800
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant politicians in the past few </v>

801
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.823
<v Speaker 1>years who've been largely undone by </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects that people have heard in their </v>

802
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:18.190
<v Speaker 1>voice and that they haven't been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work around.</v>

803
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ed miliband would be an example of </v>

804
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 1>somebody that seems like it sounds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

805
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 1>What was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy Hill?</v>

806
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.093
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go.</v>

807
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just filled it out.</v>

808
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:33.171
<v Speaker 1>My buttons quite nasal quality to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice and quite um,</v>

809
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

810
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like it was difficult for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak.</v>

811
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally he sounded scared of his voice.</v>

812
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.910
<v Speaker 1>That's think something that was said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sounding voice.</v>

813
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:49.140
<v Speaker 1>So I've worked with someone.</v>

814
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sounded like someone who kind of knew</v>

815
00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:58.040
<v Speaker 1>that people were going to be critical of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his voice when he started talking.</v>

816
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I Sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not,</v>

817
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not an election for not giving me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of fun.</v>

818
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

819
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.433
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with a performance poet who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually has a very similar voice to ed </v>

820
00:38:11.111 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 1>miliband and he does poetry out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

821
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:14.850
<v Speaker 1>he's out on the streets doing poetry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

822
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:15.743
<v Speaker 1>never because it was a bit nasally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are enjoying this </v>

823
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.083
<v Speaker 1>because he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my thing and I really wished </v>

824
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.394
<v Speaker 1>they'd bill banker just love his voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forget about what people might say </v>

825
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 1>about it because actually it was him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandy anxious about his voice.</v>

826
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.960
<v Speaker 1>His seat was often the thing you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up on,</v>

827
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like how you lose losing erection if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it too much.</v>

828
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that now,</v>

829
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>like now could we have listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>theresa and then</v>

830
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.173
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corbyn's see if we can judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>their voices here that are in </v>

831
00:38:39.341 --> 00:38:40.174
<v Speaker 2>parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to hear Theresa May's </v>

832
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:42.034
<v Speaker 2>Voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Sophie Scott was already said she </v>

833
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.093
<v Speaker 2>disliked.</v>

834
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.943
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did she support the reopening of </v>

835
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:47.584
<v Speaker 3>Wellingborough prison some program or </v>
<v Speaker 3>would you rather just sing happy </v>

836
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:58.231
<v Speaker 3>birthday and I'm very happy to wish him </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very copy the estate today.</v>

837
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:01.924
<v Speaker 3>Many happy returns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that Mrs Bowen is going to treat </v>

838
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:08.510
<v Speaker 3>the occasion inappropriate manner in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex club,</v>

839
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 3>a sex</v>

840
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.160
<v Speaker 2>quip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for Scott there is some.</v>

841
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean it feels unfair to which those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's voices,</v>

842
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:23.760
<v Speaker 2>because we've kind of got what we've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're criticizing someone's foot,</v>

843
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.683
<v Speaker 2>but it's that there is a source of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a foot mouth won't shoes that were too </v>

844
00:39:30.391 --> 00:39:31.224
<v Speaker 2>tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you exactly what's </v>

845
00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:33.804
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something going on that a </v>

846
00:39:35.011 --> 00:39:35.844
<v Speaker 2>couple of points in the evening that </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke where she lucky tent sound in a </v>

847
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:40.950
<v Speaker 2>vocal folds is giving a weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

848
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.113
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do an impersonation of it and </v>

849
00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Widdecombe does it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a posh word speaking.</v>

850
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 2>You think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

851
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.433
<v Speaker 2>so we've caught all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously a neurological </v>

852
00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:51.330
<v Speaker 2>component until after we have discussed </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

853
00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's an anatomical component of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course to voice it says something that's</v>

854
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.403
<v Speaker 2>happening at the level of the vocal </v>
<v Speaker 2>chords and you think that sometimes </v>

855
00:39:56.921 --> 00:40:01.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a little strangulated how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold at.</v>

856
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

857
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.883
<v Speaker 2>bearing in mind everything about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice is reflecting a lot of complex </v>

858
00:40:04.591 --> 00:40:05.900
<v Speaker 2>stuff about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually it's diff.</v>

859
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Big differences do come in and how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>use your,</v>

860
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.140
<v Speaker 2>your larynx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your vocal folds.</v>

861
00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.280
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

862
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:14.070
<v Speaker 2>that's coming in in terms of just what </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you got.</v>

863
00:40:14.071 --> 00:40:17.280
<v Speaker 2>So men have larger vocal folds that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>thicker,</v>

864
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.140
<v Speaker 2>so just like a larger musical </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrument,</v>

865
00:40:19.141 --> 00:40:24.141
<v Speaker 2>they make a lower sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm the French horn.</v>

866
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.120
<v Speaker 2>The producer of this show plays French </v>
<v Speaker 2>horn.</v>

867
00:40:27.121 --> 00:40:30.780
<v Speaker 2>So I just gave me a little look then </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I knew we'd be thinking about.</v>

868
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.550
<v Speaker 2>But even then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

869
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.830
<v Speaker 2>if you hold your vocal fold slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

870
00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:38.664
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right now doing something called </v>

871
00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:41.160
<v Speaker 2>modal voice and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.710
<v Speaker 2>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I know using tricks,</v>

873
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.540
<v Speaker 2>how I am vibrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vocal folds.</v>

874
00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:47.880
<v Speaker 2>So all you do to vibrate them as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them together and then you're,</v>

875
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.763
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using your chest actually to </v>

876
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.980
<v Speaker 2>produce a very finally controlled flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>of air out.</v>

877
00:40:52.981 --> 00:40:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So they fly back and forth and make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>

878
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.463
<v Speaker 2>Just like Gareth playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's French horn when he's doing the </v>

879
00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.290
<v Speaker 2>same thing at his lips.</v>

880
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.770
<v Speaker 2>That's where you really can play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got this,</v>

881
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.633
<v Speaker 2>you've got this musical sound here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in fact even if you hold them under </v>

882
00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:10.500
<v Speaker 2>slightly different tension and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm doing something cool,</v>

883
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:15.501
<v Speaker 2>creaky voice voice and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually holding the vocal folds in</v>

884
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.983
<v Speaker 2>a slightly slack away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they vibrate differently and you get </v>

885
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:21.410
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some soda,</v>

886
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.640
<v Speaker 2>sounds a bit more laid back to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

887
00:41:23.641 --> 00:41:24.474
<v Speaker 2>Although they porsche wave speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>David Cameron and incredibly creaky </v>

888
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

889
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's a massive part of American </v>
<v Speaker 2>accents.</v>

890
00:41:30.951 --> 00:41:31.784
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually one of the main one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main place where you'll find creaky </v>

891
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:34.484
<v Speaker 2>voice</v>

892
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 1>of my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right here I am.</v>

893
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 1>This is me just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

894
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to be self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be a normal man.</v>

895
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I have got a little bit water caught on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tom and Jerry Punch.</v>

896
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get that.</v>

897
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.120
<v Speaker 1>If you know Tom and Jerry Punch bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper.</v>

898
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.653
<v Speaker 1>According the Tom and Jerry a punch bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a very interesting voice </v>

899
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.930
<v Speaker 1>because you really do use melody a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal and you're obviously you don't.</v>

900
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm new here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comes in,</v>

901
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 1>comes the scientist to tell you that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>also speak quite quickly,</v>

902
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 1>actually combines to give quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant way.</v>

903
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.513
<v Speaker 1>Christ on Mount Sinai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would've been good at talking one </v>

904
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:08.731
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

905
00:42:08.731 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 1>He must have been hearing from us well </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

906
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it caught on.</v>

907
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.463
<v Speaker 1>There's actually something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>central about humans standing up and </v>

908
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:19.310
<v Speaker 1>talking and people or doing things with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their voices.</v>

909
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.143
<v Speaker 1>People like watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like watching somebody speak with </v>

910
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 1>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like watching somebody saying,</v>

911
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 1>we love watching somebody big box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like watching actors.</v>

912
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually,</v>

913
00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 1>there's something really entrancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the performance of the voice.</v>

914
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.790
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about Hitler then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as policies.</v>

915
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 1>There's face it now we can say that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a cruel man,</v>

916
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.753
<v Speaker 1>like he's vocal style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting that to one side moment for </v>

917
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.143
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to have been a very engaging </v>

918
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:44.084
<v Speaker 1>public speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonderful quentin crisp quote </v>

919
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone asked him,</v>

920
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.050
<v Speaker 1>why did Hitler have charisma and credit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crispin said,</v>

921
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose he must have done otherwise.</v>

922
00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:54.174
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have an awful lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>now have a certain age wandering around </v>

923
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:57.081
<v Speaker 1>Germany saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what came over me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was obviously able to.</v>

925
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the same man.</v>

926
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Quentin crisp offered this definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>charisma.</v>

927
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.160
<v Speaker 1>The ability to influence without logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

928
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.880
<v Speaker 1>An interesting definition of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

929
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:12.763
<v Speaker 1>because like when I watched hit lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do for science against </v>

930
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Hitler obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

931
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd like someone going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on like that at me.</v>

932
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 1>He's really ranting and raving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seldom mellow.</v>

933
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.193
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose you just get these big fashions </v>

934
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've seen it recently in politics,</v>

935
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 1>big changes in what we think sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

936
00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:34.840
<v Speaker 1>You just don't get Neil Kinnock style </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric in government now for us here,</v>

937
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 1>we've moved very quickly through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

938
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.070
<v Speaker 1>you get these big changes and even see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in acting.</v>

939
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 1>If you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>over the last century styles and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like naturalistic acting change a</v>

941
00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:46.574
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we want to see in a talker can </v>

942
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>be highly variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get that in and everything,</v>

943
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:52.364
<v Speaker 1>it's what humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are cultures learn and develop </v>

944
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 1>and change.</v>

945
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.660
<v Speaker 1>We don't tend to sit with just one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

946
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.703
<v Speaker 1>this is the best it will ever be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the external factors that are </v>

947
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:00.464
<v Speaker 1>changing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something as seemingly fundamental is </v>

948
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:02.880
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

949
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.570
<v Speaker 1>like this is what is natural with </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural alters.</v>

950
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Because natural means essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural means without inflection.</v>

951
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:09.524
<v Speaker 1>Natural means absolute and total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that changes as a result of </v>

952
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.110
<v Speaker 1>acculturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is being expressed?</v>

953
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons I'm interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>

954
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:17.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to share that shit with Juliet says in </v>

955
00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:19.701
<v Speaker 1>Romeo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juliet,</v>

956
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 1>like voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>

957
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:21.734
<v Speaker 1>be breath and breath be life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like it's something about </v>

958
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:24.764
<v Speaker 1>essence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like in the beginning there was the </v>

959
00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:26.654
<v Speaker 1>word or the vibration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard these interesting sound </v>

960
00:44:29.641 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>from deep space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like gongs vibrating</v>

961
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.383
<v Speaker 2>into the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is something like in the way </v>

962
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 2>that we communicate that is connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth very,</v>

963
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:40.644
<v Speaker 2>very deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this is something that can be </v>

964
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.953
<v Speaker 2>manipulated and managed and used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his power could potentially be </v>

965
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 2>limitless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

966
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.234
<v Speaker 2>it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can certainly think of examples </v>

967
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:52.960
<v Speaker 2>where we get caught up in this element </v>
<v Speaker 2>of performance.</v>

968
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I suppose one thing is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a performance.</v>

969
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Me Talking to you now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am performing being so fee.</v>

970
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.430
<v Speaker 2>There's never a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some abstract notion of uh,</v>

971
00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 2>sophie voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always been doing it for someone</v>

972
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:03.414
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in some particular context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never speaking without reference to </v>

973
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:06.474
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the performance where </v>

974
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:08.904
<v Speaker 2>we as a group of people decide to shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and let some people worse than </v>

975
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.023
<v Speaker 2>onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something with their voices were we </v>

976
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:18.600
<v Speaker 2>then engage with that and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed in that changes.</v>

977
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.433
<v Speaker 2>So we know over a lifetime all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat talk differently as we get older </v>

978
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 2>because the people around us change how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they speak and we pick up on that.</v>

979
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Even the queen speaks differently to how</v>
<v Speaker 2>she used to speak her vows.</v>

980
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Shay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now your majesty,</v>

981
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 2>She's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's chopped it up a bit shallow and it</v>

982
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:37.104
<v Speaker 2>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like a continuous process of </v>

983
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:42.780
<v Speaker 2>everybody coming a bit less posh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's back to old dvds.</v>

984
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I even don't have to go back very far </v>
<v Speaker 2>like TB programs in the nineties.</v>

985
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:46.404
<v Speaker 2>You watched the news that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds incredibly posh and they will </v>

986
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:53.601
<v Speaker 2>have sounded much less people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking sit down and tolerate this path.</v>

987
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what that is.</v>

988
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I do think whether I won't tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're an expert,</v>

989
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm just some bloke who's it for about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for half an hour,</v>

990
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 2>but what I reckon it is is that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mass communication,</v>

991
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>we're all aware of broader context and </v>
<v Speaker 2>different variables and are able to make</v>

992
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 2>different comparisons and now there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an emerging narrative that power</v>

993
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:15.330
<v Speaker 2>is corrupt and power is connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

994
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 2>poshness and elitist.</v>

995
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.220
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my accent changes.</v>

996
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.143
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May Have bounced up and down that class </v>

997
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 2>ladder like little trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>

998
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.073
<v Speaker 2>la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm the sort of around like </v>

999
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.900
<v Speaker 2>sort of like my girlfriend really </v>
<v Speaker 2>tormented me for a.</v>

1000
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 2>she's that how much I love working class</v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

1001
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Like when we went to think it was called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drusen to pick up some gravel.</v>

1002
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry that that's my life.</v>

1003
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And there's this bloke there called mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he came over and wanted to fight ots</v>

1004
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.373
<v Speaker 2>that and I was like a lot and I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>goodbye to him in an overly elaborate </v>

1005
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:48.320
<v Speaker 2>way and even waved at him a second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back for another bite of a cherry</v>

1006
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.600
<v Speaker 2>out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1007
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.630
<v Speaker 2>actually I think I like that so I might </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn off,</v>

1008
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.290
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need sand so that I might.</v>

1009
00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I taught our power how much sodium or </v>
<v Speaker 2>for power?</v>

1010
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.040
<v Speaker 2>The tomatoes are bloody cockney </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely ridiculous.</v>

1011
00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:08.850
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly why we change our voices.</v>

1012
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we.</v>

1013
00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.143
<v Speaker 2>Let's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to change our voices to talk to </v>

1014
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 2>somebody so soon as we started talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other without agreeing to do so,</v>

1015
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.823
<v Speaker 2>we started to breathe together because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do that to have a </v>

1016
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:22.344
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to coordinate how you breed </v>

1017
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>because that lets you time voices going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth,</v>

1018
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:28.620
<v Speaker 2>the turn taking conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so physical.</v>

1019
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.260
<v Speaker 2>It really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we also matched</v>

1020
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.093
<v Speaker 1>the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pitch and positive voices and the </v>

1021
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:33.934
<v Speaker 1>rhythm of our voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have to bring together because </v>

1022
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got this very rhythmic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1023
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.263
<v Speaker 1>he's like a dance conversation and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only do that dance if you start to </v>

1024
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 1>align your behavior so that has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to talk,</v>

1025
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.693
<v Speaker 1>and then the more you like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you will start to do other </v>

1026
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change your voice,</v>

1027
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.544
<v Speaker 1>to bring it towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are studies that have shown </v>

1028
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.573
<v Speaker 1>that the more a man likes a woman will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will raise the pitch of his voice to </v>

1029
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 1>be near to hers just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's super self conscious,</v>

1030
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.143
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1031
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.760
<v Speaker 1>and you believe that you'll start to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same words.</v>

1032
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:10.594
<v Speaker 1>You start to use the same pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeep and start to use the same grammar </v>

1033
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>as each other and the and the more you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the communication here.</v>

1034
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.193
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make a connection with </v>

1035
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to defy the material prison</v>

1036
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:22.743
<v Speaker 1>of our anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling trapped and it's the </v>

1037
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.234
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that he's not really holy or </v>

1038
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:28.534
<v Speaker 1>truly you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a vibration emanating from you that </v>

1039
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:31.204
<v Speaker 1>is your misery that you've sent out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to make connections and </v>

1040
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:36.430
<v Speaker 1>communication with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this shit up,</v>

1041
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.690
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1042
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.713
<v Speaker 1>and it's always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's always expressing like a lot of </v>

1043
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you that you don't realize and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing how you feel about the people</v>

1044
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking to fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>unavoidably.</v>

1045
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1046
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start watching myself back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the because we do a bit of funny bit </v>

1047
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 1>in my standup show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where I talk about when I did this</v>

1048
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 1>interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that we make jokes about,</v>

1049
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm going by we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean me because clearly I consider </v>

1050
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:01.474
<v Speaker 1>myself for about nine people might </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have people that work with her </v>

1051
00:49:03.371 --> 00:49:04.600
<v Speaker 1>in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1052
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.153
<v Speaker 1>is that I love about how I go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different personas when dealing </v>

1053
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 1>with Jeremy Paxman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start very light and affable.</v>

1054
00:49:12.701 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a moment where I got really</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious and then I get very sort of.</v>

1055
00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I like I started deliberately or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately,</v>

1056
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 1>but unconsciously referencing ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak rhythms,</v>

1057
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:24.723
<v Speaker 1>very working class base because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously see myself as speaking on </v>

1058
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 1>behalf of outsiders and I use it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack technique.</v>

1059
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting to watch and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

1060
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can mark similarity with it.</v>

1061
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.760
<v Speaker 1>You can mark difference because I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>right because I'm definitely not trying.</v>

1062
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I'd have to say.</v>

1063
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:46.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1064
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:51.031
<v Speaker 1>Listen brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely ridiculous.</v>

1065
00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like a grime single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still playing that your apps,</v>

1066
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:56.923
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was marking out your position to him </v>

1067
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 1>as clearly and how you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying.</v>

1068
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not actively want to be you,</v>

1069
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.650
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling myself.</v>

1070
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:04.953
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's because I suppose the reason </v>

1071
00:50:07.691 --> 00:50:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that we wanted to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sophie Scott,</v>

1072
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.750
<v Speaker 1>is for us to understand how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>

1073
00:50:10.751 --> 00:50:12.970
<v Speaker 1>we can use these means of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

1074
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.310
<v Speaker 1>laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vocal style,</v>

1075
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1076
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:17.524
<v Speaker 1>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a better question than minuses </v>

1077
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 1>gas because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1078
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.073
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more succinct way of saying what </v>

1079
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.084
<v Speaker 1>vocal techniques should be aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we be aware of in the lead up to </v>

1080
00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the election from Theresa May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corbin and other</v>

1081
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.720
<v Speaker 2>political leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What should we watch out for?</v>

1082
00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.663
<v Speaker 2>There's very strong outbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people just going back to the same </v>

1083
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strong and stable,</v>

1084
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.300
<v Speaker 2>rigging the election and just keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying and even with the same breath,</v>

1085
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're just cutting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pasting into the stream of speeches.</v>

1086
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's this?</v>

1087
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.183
<v Speaker 2>There was the assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got no attention span and we're </v>

1088
00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:49.370
<v Speaker 2>bloody idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1089
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 2>There is a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1090
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:52.094
<v Speaker 2>I think there's very good evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are not good at remembering </v>

1091
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.073
<v Speaker 2>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember just just remembering the </v>

1092
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:01.910
<v Speaker 2>just you bloody idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that's it.</v>

1093
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:02.744
<v Speaker 2>I think they're trying to influence the </v>
<v Speaker 2>just and that just you let that just be </v>

1094
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:08.714
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we met with surely creditors with </v>

1095
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:12.194
<v Speaker 2>the ability to understand at least some </v>
<v Speaker 2>different words that mean strong and </v>

1096
00:51:14.331 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:20.201
<v Speaker 2>rather than just repeat just exactly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and foreign and color,</v>

1098
00:51:20.301 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 2>but no just bombard people in to do if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are beleaguered,</v>

1099
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:24.680
<v Speaker 2>fearful and last the whole time.</v>

1100
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.150
<v Speaker 2>If you just keep staying strong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>

1101
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:26.984
<v Speaker 2>strong and stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you're gonna vote for him starting </v>

1102
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.173
<v Speaker 2>to roll out of order and if there's one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the odd things about people using </v>

1103
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 2>lightheartedness or comedy in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice or in their approach,</v>

1104
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 2>particularly in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can play hard.</v>

1105
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Well and it can also go horribly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but there is a exactly like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the top,</v>

1107
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.103
<v Speaker 2>there are situations where it's simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate and people will sort of </v>

1108
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 2>recoil from it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't right then there,</v>

1109
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.283
<v Speaker 2>but in other situations it can be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly efficient way of looking </v>

1110
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.270
<v Speaker 2>confident and able and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what?</v>

1111
00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 2>because what you're saying is I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined by this context,</v>

1113
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 2>but that is a risky game to say that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of this context.</v>

1114
00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 2>It's about power obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1115
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:05.953
<v Speaker 2>Because if people say it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for you to say that in this </v>

1116
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:09.524
<v Speaker 2>context by saying I'm in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context and if you say I disagree with </v>

1117
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:13.964
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're saying I'm in charge of the </v>

1118
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:17.700
<v Speaker 2>context is a real game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1119
00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:18.534
<v Speaker 2>and I think sometimes one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we like about people who would be </v>

1120
00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:22.664
<v Speaker 2>prepared to use not necessarily like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rarely see somebody in politics or </v>

1121
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 2>just like all party all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't work,</v>

1122
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:31.310
<v Speaker 2>but drops would drop into is </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally when it feels like,</v>

1123
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:34.420
<v Speaker 2>or it could have gone a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they've just sort of thrown a um,</v>

1124
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 2>something slightly lighter hearted </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1125
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:38.880
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that,</v>

1126
00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:39.723
<v Speaker 2>oh well I'm in here for giggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm kind of confident enough to let </v>

1127
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you know that this is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing to worry about.</v>

1128
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.033
<v Speaker 2>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that might still be a bad </v>

1129
00:52:47.271 --> 00:52:48.104
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's a signifier of </v>

1130
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:49.723
<v Speaker 2>someone's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly one of the things </v>

1131
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:53.174
<v Speaker 2>that is sorely lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at the moment people quite seem </v>

1132
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.860
<v Speaker 2>quite frightened of what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have going off message.</v>

1133
00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I think a climate of fear is what Jay is</v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibitive and restrictive.</v>

1134
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:02.264
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear literally affects us anatomically </v>

1135
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:06.750
<v Speaker 2>and constricts the vocal cords and </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially it does that.</v>

1136
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 2>People are less likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1137
00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:13.661
<v Speaker 2>like when when I do live shows now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I go out of metropolitan areas,</v>

1138
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a nervousness when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about Islam,</v>

1139
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.633
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about like sort of subjects </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've been taught to understand as </v>

1140
00:53:23.481 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>contentious and we therefore shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh from</v>

1141
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 1>them because I don't know what I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like that agreeing with that,</v>

1142
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 1>where we go laugh though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1143
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:31.554
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the communication becomes </v>

1144
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we include in what's humorous.</v>

1145
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.753
<v Speaker 1>Now of course we won't be derisory </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissive or cruel about things that </v>

1146
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:43.110
<v Speaker 1>are important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think humor precisely builds these</v>

1147
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 1>bonds as it does between a father and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1148
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:47.664
<v Speaker 1>It does between whole communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing that ultimately with the </v>

1149
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:50.484
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>

1150
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.793
<v Speaker 1>I might posit dear Professor Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what comedy is continually doing </v>

1151
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.860
<v Speaker 1>is it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shifting the frame and we say like,</v>

1152
00:54:00.861 --> 00:54:01.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are.</v>

1153
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:02.364
<v Speaker 1>You and I are having this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>making these podcasts and then comedy </v>

1154
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:06.950
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to die me.</v>

1155
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very,</v>

1156
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.723
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very temporary arrangement between us </v>

1157
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.363
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't acknowledge the truth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we can't hold this </v>

1158
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:14.484
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are powerful elements of not </v>

1159
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:17.514
<v Speaker 1>only chaos of entropy and function that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to mean that everything's </v>

1160
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 1>going to end.</v>

1161
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.093
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The center cannot hold and like I think </v>

1162
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:27.630
<v Speaker 1>comedy is an expression that I'm all </v>
<v Speaker 1>right with that.</v>

1163
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with it and I think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use this a lot,</v>

1164
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but like Tommy Cooper's act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1165
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:33.054
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I think is beautiful is </v>

1166
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 1>because Tommy Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British comedian,</v>

1167
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 1>30 $40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God perhaps 50 years ago.</v>

1168
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And like a lifestyle of that did a photo</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic act where things went wrong.</v>

1169
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenious,</v>

1170
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:45.444
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's like his intention is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's not even come on the stage to </v>

1171
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:48.684
<v Speaker 1>try and be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's come out to try and do this magic </v>

1172
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:50.994
<v Speaker 1>act and everything will be okay if only </v>
<v Speaker 1>this magic cat goes all right and the </v>

1173
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:54.294
<v Speaker 1>magic act never does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the intersection of </v>

1174
00:54:56.461 --> 00:54:57.294
<v Speaker 1>comedy happens there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at sort of like musical </v>

1175
00:54:59.131 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 1>entertainers like Frankie Howard or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenneth Williams,</v>

1176
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:04.100
<v Speaker 1>they always glancing to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Harry,</v>

1177
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:04.973
<v Speaker 1>he'll actually uses that sort of second </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera that he talks into sound that </v>

1178
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.170
<v Speaker 1>there's another layer to reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a connection.</v>

1179
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I think between comedy and the trickster</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the trickster is forever saying this</v>

1180
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 1>isn't the absolute contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is another world.</v>

1181
00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:17.100
<v Speaker 1>There's another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the words of Morrissey,</v>

1182
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:18.270
<v Speaker 1>there must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there must be,</v>

1183
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1184
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>about comedy.</v>

1185
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you now think I'm clever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1186
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you're doing an man so as you must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's um,</v>

1187
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.170
<v Speaker 1>the clearly extremely well put point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Them.</v>

1188
00:55:32.171 --> 00:55:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay them to go.</v>

1189
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:34.863
<v Speaker 1>It is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the history of human </v>

1190
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.933
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course we were reliant on people </v>

1191
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 1>writing stuff down because words don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay around.</v>

1192
00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 1>If you state them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

1193
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>you look at wherever you find people </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing in human history,</v>

1194
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:46.943
<v Speaker 1>you find them writing down jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been making jokes as far </v>

1195
00:55:50.491 --> 00:55:53.200
<v Speaker 1>back as we can find written words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been writing graffiti on walls.</v>

1196
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:54.623
<v Speaker 1>There's a piece of Babylonian Papaya us </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a really weak joke about how to </v>

1197
00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 1>make a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go fishing.</v>

1198
00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put naked women in fishing nets and </v>

1199
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe it works better in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ancient Egypt.</v>

1200
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a pun in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In ancient Egyptian,</v>

1201
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.170
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's on its own is not enough.</v>

1202
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Put Women in fishing nets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drill fire could come into the pyramid.</v>

1203
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably can't get out of here.</v>

1204
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole</v>

1205
00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Roman book called the laughter lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1206
00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.053
<v Speaker 2>it's preserved all the jokes and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because they have the </v>

1207
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 2>structure and appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jokes,</v>

1208
00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:34.043
<v Speaker 2>they're not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Bowman actually did an act where he </v>

1209
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 2>read out from it and he had to do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of work,</v>

1210
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of work and it's because of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1211
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the content changes.</v>

1212
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of the times science </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it tries to look at comedy,</v>

1213
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:51.783
<v Speaker 2>gets caught up on that because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>find something that's always funny for </v>

1214
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 2>everybody everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one glance at that.</v>

1215
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 2>But by the Babylonian joke that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so good,</v>

1216
00:56:57.761 --> 00:56:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they wrote it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1217
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 2>suggest that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to forget this thing.</v>

1218
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Go and get mashups of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a complicated.</v>

1219
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:08.643
<v Speaker 2>And then so you've got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that people were doing </v>

1220
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1221
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 2>We have used humor probably from as soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we had words,</v>

1222
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:15.814
<v Speaker 2>we were laughing before we had words and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will probably using words to try and </v>

1223
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 2>get to laughed and maybe in a playful </v>
<v Speaker 2>way or whatever way since then.</v>

1224
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.823
<v Speaker 2>But then you get this very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>development as an art form because you </v>

1225
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 2>see this in humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1226
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:33.510
<v Speaker 2>endlessly endlessly innovating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing stuff that doesn't immediately</v>

1227
00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of necessarily get you fed or keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>you somewhere to sleep.</v>

1228
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:40.120
<v Speaker 2>But which is fun and interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging.</v>

1229
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>When you see the modern humans may </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>

1230
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 2>You just get this explosion of stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

1231
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:47.074
<v Speaker 2>I think a huge one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you start to get the role of the </v>

1232
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 2>person that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trickster,</v>

1233
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.433
<v Speaker 2>the person who's the jester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who has the role of kind of </v>

1234
00:57:56.231 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 2>controlling that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very,</v>

1235
00:57:58.571 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 2>very interesting evolution.</v>

1236
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's worth bearing in mind that standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy is incredibly new art form.</v>

1237
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.680
<v Speaker 2>The only really existed as we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize it with,</v>

1238
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:09.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some one person on stage talking to the </v>

1239
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:15.460
<v Speaker 2>audience since a really unfortunate man </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Frank Fay.</v>

1240
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:16.323
<v Speaker 2>He was around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was around sort of in the twenties </v>

1241
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.544
<v Speaker 2>and thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the first guy who had the </v>

1242
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 2>sort of hotspur to not have another </v>
<v Speaker 2>person on stage with him.</v>

1243
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:26.783
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was to never feed and he didn't </v>

1244
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:29.224
<v Speaker 2>have comedy costumes and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of came on stage not going blog </v>

1245
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not putting anything on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had this kind of like,</v>

1246
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to find some flexible youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's very.</v>

1247
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like I'm not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest material,</v>

1248
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but it absolutely slayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had this kind of confidence to do</v>

1249
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:50.350
<v Speaker 2>this and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was part of you consider themselves</v>

1250
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:51.184
<v Speaker 2>to be a lot better than the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians must have done because they </v>

1251
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:55.110
<v Speaker 2>just have the balls to go up.</v>

1252
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.213
<v Speaker 2>They June no more light to the feed guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil incarcerate must've been </v>

1253
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:00.390
<v Speaker 2>magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're lucky charms,</v>

1254
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.293
<v Speaker 2>comedy politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually also choose politics and </v>

1255
00:59:04.351 --> 00:59:07.050
<v Speaker 2>the reason why it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Frankie,</v>

1256
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:07.943
<v Speaker 2>he's not more frequently discussed the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a massive Nazi maps upside with </v>

1257
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so very good.</v>

1258
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.430
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

1259
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.500
<v Speaker 2>This slaughter all non Christian people </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed the Gypsies about him,</v>

1260
00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frank.</v>

1262
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need to get advocates.</v>

1263
00:59:28.091 --> 00:59:30.160
<v Speaker 2>He used to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't work with fitbit.</v>

1264
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.450
<v Speaker 2>They bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not have them all?</v>

1265
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh Frank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible Nazi.</v>

1266
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:41.160
<v Speaker 2>He was running pro Hitler rallies in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York after police.</v>

1267
00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much people who felt that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>done and dusted.</v>

1268
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 2>The this Hitler Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1269
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:53.861
<v Speaker 2>bad tool band checked your fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's largely not remembered fondly.</v>

1270
00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see frank better commemorate it.</v>

1271
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Bev,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at Bob Hope.</v>

1272
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.153
<v Speaker 2>You can see Bob Hope's act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was completely influenced by his </v>

1273
01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>voice and sort of the appearance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of sophisticated gentlemen act</v>

1274
01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the great master?</v>

1275
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.913
<v Speaker 2>So you can see the roots of it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that that hat on you can </v>

1276
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:17.624
<v Speaker 2>sort of see stand up comedy is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>another manifestation in our culture of </v>

1277
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:25.240
<v Speaker 2>this endless drive for humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for comedy and we're still,</v>

1278
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I think negotiating the role of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that means.</v>

1279
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.393
<v Speaker 2>What's this discussion about like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>written word versus or a tree because </v>

1280
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>like I've heard that like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like this in America.</v>

1281
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:37.410
<v Speaker 2>He calls himself American Indian </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1282
01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 2>sadly deceased called Russell me.</v>

1283
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.983
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says there's this beautiful speech </v>

1284
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.760
<v Speaker 2>which I read written down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it begins.</v>

1285
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Lastly you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1286
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:45.824
<v Speaker 2>you may very well be reading this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm speaking [inaudible] European </v>

1287
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you've given us is the</v>

1288
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 2>written word will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ours is an oral tradition and we believe</v>

1289
01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:52.634
<v Speaker 2>in the truth of speech and the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they never had to have a thing </v>

1290
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:55.184
<v Speaker 2>about socrates saying that it was sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of more important the spoken word and </v>

1291
01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 2>the written word because there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>central truth that can only.</v>

1292
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I supposed to relate to the voice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the presence.</v>

1293
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.730
<v Speaker 2>What does this all mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1294
01:01:04.731 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person there.</v>

1295
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.663
<v Speaker 2>You've got that you're reacting to more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just the words they're saying and </v>

1296
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.953
<v Speaker 2>you can't not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making assumptions about that </v>

1297
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you couldn't see me,</v>

1298
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:16.994
<v Speaker 2>you would probably have an idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked like based on what I sound </v>

1299
01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:19.410
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1300
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>They could be utterly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do that all the time.</v>

1301
01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 2>We're always trying to work out who </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

1302
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>where they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

1303
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>At the same time as they're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

1304
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>we're adding in all this other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>about who we think they must be based on</v>

1305
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:32.384
<v Speaker 2>what they sound like and it gives a </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and an interpretation than </v>

1306
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:37.274
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the truth to voices that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think does give it a different kind of </v>

1307
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:41.504
<v Speaker 2>waste and the written word is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see and you look at people </v>

1308
01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:45.524
<v Speaker 2>trying to write texts or emails or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they try and put stuff back in to </v>

1309
01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>kind of try and give their character </v>
<v Speaker 2>their the emojis or dancing.</v>

1310
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 2>The emergence of emojis is because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the limitations of the spoken word.</v>

1311
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:56.924
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember how it used to be like </v>

1312
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:58.783
<v Speaker 2>there was too many problems around like </v>
<v Speaker 2>miscommunication around text and email </v>

1313
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.310
<v Speaker 2>and like it was forever happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made.</v>

1314
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I was upsetting people unlike when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>on radio,</v>

1315
01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I steak right out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel.</v>

1316
01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:09.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1317
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:10.770
<v Speaker 2>that was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1318
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I meant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smiley face.</v>

1319
01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Apology face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1320
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>but like sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>

1321
01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:17.144
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a level of sophistication that </v>

1322
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the written word can't deliver</v>

1323
01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.150
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps in the pans of proust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other you.</v>

1324
01:02:23.151 --> 01:02:23.984
<v Speaker 1>So the written word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit there and do some sorts of </v>

1325
01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>compositional work on it before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver it to the world.</v>

1326
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:28.854
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start talking you've got to </v>

1327
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I launched on a sentence and I'm somehow</v>

1328
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>got the make my way to the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank fry weren't a racist.</v>

1329
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh it is this sky and bloody well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that this threat chat chat</v>

1330
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't like that.</v>

1331
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>He was more of a smarmy character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fairly unpleasant.</v>

1332
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Can't be a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gone mostly say a cow.</v>

1333
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this thing,</v>

1334
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>professors sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a aint helpin the satire satirizing</v>

1335
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it makes him more cozy and likable,</v>

1336
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>ineffable somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just not a monster vacation.</v>

1337
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of affable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is sometimes the case that we</v>

1338
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:07.914
<v Speaker 1>can mistake laughing at somebody for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like the end of the critical work </v>

1339
01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.230
<v Speaker 1>we need to do and it was associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1340
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So it is really interesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1341
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it was it John Oliver a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago was going,</v>

1342
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please run for presidency is going to be</v>

1343
01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 1>so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was funny.</v>

1344
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:24.690
<v Speaker 1>There were some amazing and it was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happening.</v>

1345
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.963
<v Speaker 1>And then it's actually company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny now I'm still trying to keep </v>

1346
01:03:28.981 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>it humorous flap just by looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if it's not real,</v>

1347
01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but it is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1348
01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:34.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually happening as far as we </v>

1349
01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually there and that's now,</v>

1350
01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make.</v>

1351
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:41.873
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to see how people make </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at making jokes at the stuff </v>

1352
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>around I'm a trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1353
01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.413
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean Spicer stuff that they're doing so </v>

1354
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:51.684
<v Speaker 1>well on snl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder because it's already absurd </v>

1355
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>and point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1356
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.673
<v Speaker 1>we were already made all the jokes they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were to make about him before he became </v>

1357
01:03:57.991 --> 01:03:58.824
<v Speaker 1>president and it seems that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a limit to how far we can go with </v>

1358
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1359
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1360
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.583
<v Speaker 1>popular sites like the onion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not there making funny jokes but </v>

1361
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:08.694
<v Speaker 1>actually not landing on trump because </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's already we're already too </v>

1362
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:13.674
<v Speaker 1>far into it to be able to have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance enough to make jokes about it </v>

1363
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1364
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're making jokes,</v>

1365
01:04:19.891 --> 01:04:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you're still talking about him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still winning.</v>

1366
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:23.003
<v Speaker 1>Evidently there was a degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication to that campaign that </v>

1367
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:26.223
<v Speaker 1>obviously this of popular press we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not aware of and I think it's sort of </v>

1368
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>like more as well as communicative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was statistical.</v>

1369
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think they understood that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this area want this message.</v>

1370
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.993
<v Speaker 1>Give them that message no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people over there think they're </v>

1371
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 1>never gonna vote for you anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget them.</v>

1372
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can sort of see as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so communicate the relationship between </v>

1373
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:51.870
<v Speaker 1>communication and truth versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>

1374
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:52.441
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1375
01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:53.274
<v Speaker 1>like the white sort of politics has </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed in that it seems to be this </v>

1376
01:04:55.861 --> 01:04:58.610
<v Speaker 1>peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dance or manipulation of power now.</v>

1377
01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.653
<v Speaker 1>It's notable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a sort of now kind </v>

1378
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>of redundancy to Ukip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of think ukip done its job.</v>

1379
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>The Conservative Party is you kip now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't really,</v>

1380
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't really require one for Raj has</v>
<v Speaker 1>so disappeared like an of a tenor to.</v>

1381
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.123
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that I would use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a vocal or word not just to </v>

1382
01:05:20.701 --> 01:05:21.534
<v Speaker 1>impress you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because it seems right that </v>

1383
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:23.203
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this something tonally about </v>

1384
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:26.044
<v Speaker 1>the conservative party that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging exclusion that the anti </v>

1385
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.124
<v Speaker 1>immigration rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vague xenophobia and of course the </v>

1386
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>removal from the European Union itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's present,</v>

1387
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.633
<v Speaker 1>it's present now politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's doesn't seem to be any need for </v>

1388
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it now for Ukip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean primarily I entirely agree.</v>

1389
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1390
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:48.663
<v Speaker 1>it's been an interesting cycle to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happen and there was something </v>

1391
01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:52.774
<v Speaker 1>similar happened in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the really far right organizations </v>

1392
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.733
<v Speaker 1>which were essentially expressly </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into Margaret Thatcher's </v>

1393
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>version of conservatism and we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>an nf and stuff.</v>

1394
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:05.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1395
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the British National Party that can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1396
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.413
<v Speaker 1>and they were pretty full on and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of an extension of what the </v>

1397
01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Party roughtly colored as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>remit that just started,</v>

1398
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:20.080
<v Speaker 1>just incorporate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they did indeed go away,</v>

1399
01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:20.914
<v Speaker 1>is gangs of skinheads at rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they then became the government got </v>

1400
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>rid of those gangs of skin edge around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like God,</v>

1401
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>the government now still agreeing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1402
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1403
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting.</v>

1404
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Sophie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen minutes.</v>

1405
01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:35.524
<v Speaker 1>We've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has already been longer than I </v>

1406
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:37.564
<v Speaker 1>anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed the analysis of the </v>

1407
01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the role of laughter.</v>

1408
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Should we try and find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic to end upon?</v>

1409
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean if laughter and Kim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication and it's ultimately about </v>

1410
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>creating a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps they will always be.</v>

1411
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a role for or </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity doesn't there.</v>

1412
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:55.503
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a way that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate those central truths and it </v>

1413
01:06:57.551 --> 01:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>will bring people together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't or can't be.</v>

1414
01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 1>This reductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitive,</v>

1415
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:02.343
<v Speaker 1>simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disingenuous politics that's come to </v>

1416
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>govern our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of casual,</v>

1417
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>halfhearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost nihilism of,</v>

1418
01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the trump presidency,</v>

1419
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.570
<v Speaker 1>the madness of the lurch to the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the world.</v>

1420
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Is there another way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there another way?</v>

1421
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1422
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.910
<v Speaker 1>something that you've kept talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

1423
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>that was really badly put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it something you kept talking about?</v>

1424
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You keep coming back to love and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1425
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I think we haven't been very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the importance of law.</v>

1426
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be embarrassed about that.</v>

1427
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>

1428
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>There's been removed from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the centric the bay.</v>

1429
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:40.720
<v Speaker 1>We've been told like don't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>love is stupid.</v>

1430
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It's childish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this attack on Jeremy Corbyn,</v>

1431
01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Martin headed by Boris Johnson were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying stuff like that.</v>

1432
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:48.244
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're at eaton saying things like </v>

1433
01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:49.804
<v Speaker 1>that probably gets you to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably get first dibs on the facts if </v>

1434
01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with a little lyric like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1435
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>But like saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1436
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:58.150
<v Speaker 1>he's too compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's too kind.</v>

1437
01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't nuke people willy nilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying that there's no room for</v>

1438
01:08:01.991 --> 01:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>love or compassion or connection like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1439
01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>These things are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no place in the,</v>

1440
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.300
<v Speaker 1>in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1441
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're central to our lives.</v>

1442
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence</v>

1443
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 2>now seems to suggest that losing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing in adulthood is a significant </v>

1444
01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:23.650
<v Speaker 2>risk for dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1445
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Recap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a significant risk.</v>

1446
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.283
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to how loud headphones on </v>

1447
01:08:28.631 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 2>when you're listening to music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1448
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because it doesn't seem</v>

1449
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>to be because it's happening to the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

1450
01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same thing that's affecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ears as affecting your brain.</v>

1451
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.773
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be because losing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing and not necessarily getting </v>

1452
01:08:40.731 --> 01:08:44.600
<v Speaker 2>access to ways of restoring that takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you out of social interaction,</v>

1453
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 2>disconnect and you go mad and you wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain does not work as well.</v>

1454
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Everything that we know about human </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains say they evolve in interactions,</v>

1455
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>they develop in interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1456
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:55.664
<v Speaker 2>Your baby's learning about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it she's learning and </v>

1457
01:08:57.351 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 2>interactions with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got no pressure,</v>

1458
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 2>but that's the and it continues being </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

1459
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 2>It's our main way of making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining social bonds,</v>

1460
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:08.234
<v Speaker 2>remained talking to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in a world where you could do it </v>

1461
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 2>all we text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still go face to face,</v>

1462
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:12.854
<v Speaker 2>we still talk to each other and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essential to our function as humans and </v>

1463
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I think we are getting less and less </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1464
01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:19.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well even the reason that we don't seem </v>

1465
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 2>to be able to get this message across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1466
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the hearing loss is really risky </v>

1467
01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:26.870
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just because it's a pain in the neck</v>

1468
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:27.704
<v Speaker 2>to lose your hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could really manifestly affect </v>

1469
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:30.494
<v Speaker 2>the shape of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not even taking that seriously as </v>

1470
01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:33.360
<v Speaker 2>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1471
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.193
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's one to watch out for them </v>

1472
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:37.000
<v Speaker 2>and it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the link,</v>

1473
01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:37.834
<v Speaker 2>the social link,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human contact that that's actually </v>

1474
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.144
<v Speaker 2>preventing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we start to need to acknowledge </v>

1475
01:09:42.651 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to obviously I'm saying so</v>

1476
01:09:44.631 --> 01:09:45.464
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific perspective because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think in science we tend not to take </v>

1477
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 2>these things seriously.</v>

1478
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.010
<v Speaker 2>We study speech without ever considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we talk to each other,</v>

1479
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:54.660
<v Speaker 2>we study emotions and never look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughter,</v>

1480
01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:55.494
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just don't go in that direction very </v>

1481
01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:57.974
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it might be a wider part of </v>

1482
01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 2>our debate about who we are as humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1483
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 2>to be massively influenced by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview with Adam Curtis,</v>

1484
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:06.044
<v Speaker 2>that the rise of individualism I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes takes the emphasis off what </v>

1485
01:10:09.921 --> 01:10:10.754
<v Speaker 2>we're doing to each other and more onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>us somehow powering through life on our </v>

1486
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 2>own towards death and actually it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial.</v>

1487
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the contact we have with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people is not a meaningless aspects.</v>

1488
01:10:21.021 --> 01:10:23.270
<v Speaker 2>That extra little bit of cheesecake in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our life.</v>

1489
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:24.104
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually essential to being a </v>

1490
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:26.090
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

1491
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>What a lovely way to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Sophie Scott.</v>

1492
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 2>We must communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must connect.</v>

1493
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 2>There's more to life than being an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

1494
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.090
<v Speaker 2>As a beautiful message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

1495
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for getting under the skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1496
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Professor Sophie Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
