00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>You are listening to Russell brand on </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the skin with me today is my </v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Vice President Al Gore.</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming or thank you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>having me.</v>

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.583
<v Speaker 1>It must be straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a what's your film and I loved </v>

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>your film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you come into a room,</v>

6
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.244
<v Speaker 1>everyone stands up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that standard even like you get </v>

7
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>standing ovations before joke's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered?</v>

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it seems to be the case in the</v>

9
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:22.914
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I just do establish it so that you </v>

10
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.614
<v Speaker 1>don't feel obligated and tense about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotional aspect of what this </v>

11
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:30.744
<v Speaker 1>interview must contain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is important for people to </v>

12
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:34.974
<v Speaker 1>see this film an inconvenient sequel </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking truth to power because for me </v>

13
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:39.684
<v Speaker 1>it rendered the issues of our global </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecology in a way that was easy to </v>

14
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.784
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made it clear that there is an </v>

15
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>imperative that we act now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also there's great cause to optimism</v>

16
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>that there are shifts both from right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing thinking.</v>

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.213
<v Speaker 1>People like your man at the end near </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of our lovely mayor who </v>

18
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.064
<v Speaker 1>shifted in Georgetown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I think sort of like the </v>

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>bullseye of what you would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional republicanism and also the,</v>

20
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the politics can be functional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>

21
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:06.354
<v Speaker 1>That's what I got from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your activity at the Paris climate </v>

22
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.193
<v Speaker 1>conference where you're able to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together that deal with a solar energy </v>

23
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>company in India who may have reneged on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

24
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a sort of,</v>

25
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>on the Paris climate agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little Doobie.</v>

26
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.494
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it will be the United States there </v>

27
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.114
<v Speaker 1>would renege on that deal anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I think it's an important film </v>

28
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>for people to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that struck me,</v>

29
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Vice President was the way that you </v>

30
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>appear to be guided to some degree by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your spirituality,</v>

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.243
<v Speaker 1>by your faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of it was like words like mission </v>

32
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that you see as a personal mission and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>also that some of the language is </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat biblical,</v>

34
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>unavoidably because of the scale of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecological disaster we are facing.</v>

35
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.363
<v Speaker 1>How do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does your spiritual perspective </v>

36
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>inform your mission to affect global </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecology?</v>

37
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And our attitude towards it.</v>

38
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

39
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:56.194
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview and for putting so much </v>

40
00:01:58.721 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 2>thought into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell.</v>

41
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wear my spirituality or religion</v>

42
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.063
<v Speaker 2>on my sleeve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a core part of who I am and </v>

43
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:12.814
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue of biblical scale in the sense </v>

44
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:17.554
<v Speaker 2>that the future of humanity could be at </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk where we not to grab hold of this </v>

45
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:23.584
<v Speaker 2>crisis and solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good news is that we are beginning </v>

46
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 2>to do just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

47
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.283
<v Speaker 2>but there is so much at stake you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really essential to put it in the </v>

48
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 2>context of will we have a future or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

49
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

50
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.843
<v Speaker 2>this is not the normal issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're now seven and a half billion </v>

51
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our technologies are incredibly powerful</v>

52
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>and we have to wrestle with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability to short term thinking and</v>

53
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 2>greed and behaviors that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>move us forward into the</v>

54
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are indeed spiritual</v>

55
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.120
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greed is a spiritual issue.</v>

56
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.103
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I was struck with time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and time again because greed is to </v>

57
00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 2>prioritize personal need over social </v>
<v Speaker 2>need or fraternity,</v>

58
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 2>the Brotherhood of man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collective is a spirit.</v>

59
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 2>These a spiritual issue because </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism,</v>

60
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I was clocking Betsey's face in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

61
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm always scanning rooms is why I live </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mr.</v>

62
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Vice President.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked saying Mr Vice President,</v>

63
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:22.604
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an enjoyable thing for person to </v>

64
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:24.944
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often I have professors and doctors in </v>

65
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>here and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm touching a little licks,</v>

66
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.770
<v Speaker 2>social climbing lik spill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to use the term like they,</v>

67
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it feels my own sense of grandiosity </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

68
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we live in a world where a conceptual</v>

69
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:37.394
<v Speaker 2>and a fictitious idea such as economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's prioritized over an actual factual </v>

70
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 2>and material ideas such as ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What hope do we have?</v>

71
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we change people's conception,</v>

72
00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:50.870
<v Speaker 2>conception of ecology when we have a a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation of people,</v>

73
00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 2>there've been schooled in consumerist </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists thinking,</v>

74
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.080
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to unpick that inner </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation?</v>

75
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the economic arguments such</v>
<v Speaker 2>as solar panels are cheaper,</v>

76
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 2>will be a sufficient tool to unpick </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations of indoctrination?</v>

77
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>People they've been taught to think like</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists.</v>

78
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

79
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v Speaker 2>the rapidly declining cost of both solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wind and now electric cars and now </v>

80
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>batteries and sustainable agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forestry,</v>

81
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these new techniques will help us,</v>

82
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.544
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're right that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis on mass consumption as a </v>

83
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.741
<v Speaker 2>pathway to happiness is definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the issue.</v>

84
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 2>You and I probably disagree on the role </v>
<v Speaker 2>of capitalism per se,</v>

85
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to get sidetracked too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much into that.</v>

86
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.053
<v Speaker 1>I want to think it is a sidetrack </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how is it that people can ever </v>

87
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:50.874
<v Speaker 1>think of the world as their home in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you generally do with your </v>

88
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>affectionate rather beautiful attachment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that image of the earth,</v>

89
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:58.644
<v Speaker 1>that first photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people clearly see the earth as a </v>

90
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>resource culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>

91
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and I think on a deep philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

92
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>if people see the outside world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that can be consumed,</v>

93
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>relationships that consumed commodities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're consumed ideas,</v>

94
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:14.814
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're consumed without a fundamental </v>

95
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:17.094
<v Speaker 1>insignificant shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you hope to achieve such an </v>

96
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 1>ambitious and goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks mate.</v>

97
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>As saving the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Well I do totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

100
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>we need a shift in consciousness and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

102
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a a keen awareness of what we're doing </v>

103
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 2>to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

104
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

105
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Speaker 2>but I do want to tell you about my views</v>
<v Speaker 2>where capitalism is concerned.</v>

106
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.093
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the alternatives to </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism in some form or explored in </v>

107
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.184
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both on the left and the right and they </v>

108
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 2>were found to have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some serious problems and excesses.</v>

109
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>But capitalism in its current form I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is in need of serious reform.</v>

110
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 2>We need to start putting a price on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>so called externalities like pollution,</v>

111
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>also the positive externalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

112
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.694
<v Speaker 2>we count investments in education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health care and treatment for </v>

113
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>addictions and community services as as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an expense.</v>

114
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And then we ignore the benefits of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditures.</v>

115
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's a distortion that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>remedied.</v>

116
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 2>We don't account for the depletion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resources and we should,</v>

117
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>we ignore the growing inequality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomes,</v>

118
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>which is threatening the future of </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

119
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.110
<v Speaker 2>If we don't</v>

120
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

121
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>because built into the economic model </v>
<v Speaker 1>under which we labor,</v>

122
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>there is no potentiality for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusion of crisis right now.</v>

123
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>The failings of the ideologies of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last century and all their extremism and</v>

124
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the war and the have a good they rigged </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

125
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.153
<v Speaker 1>does not put a full stop on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for new systems and evolve in </v>

126
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>systems and merge in national socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible,</v>

127
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communism as practice,</v>

128
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.874
<v Speaker 1>particularly Soviet communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really repeated the model of the </v>

129
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>czar ism that proceeded it rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a legitimate,</v>

130
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet experience where power wasn't </v>

131
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>paralleled and equalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

132
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly a huge failure,</v>

133
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be huge shifts.</v>

134
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.374
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this quote and I want you to </v>

135
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.054
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by this man called a Sateesh Calla </v>

136
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he spoke to Bertrand Russell,</v>

137
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.314
<v Speaker 1>who obviously in the late sixties was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent campaign for nuclear </v>

138
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>disarmament and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the point in getting rid of these</v>

139
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>nuclear missiles if we don't change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that invented them?</v>

140
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Because people will continue to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of tools and these kinds of </v>

141
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about that stays with me,</v>

142
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.643
<v Speaker 1>that what you seem to have experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally is a transformation in the </v>

143
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:42.974
<v Speaker 1>way that you see the world now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much impact can be had politicking </v>

144
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.583
<v Speaker 1>at the Paris climate to get India to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept solar power only for the u s to </v>

145
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>renege on it because of individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumerism,</v>

146
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A platform that's been laid for 50 years</v>

147
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>for Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump didn't appear in a vacuum,</v>

148
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>although there seems to be one inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and it like,</v>

149
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 1>so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I think we have to be to a key to</v>

151
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the kind of thing that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve?</v>

152
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.693
<v Speaker 1>I think that there needs to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation on an individual level </v>

153
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that is quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite profound.</v>

154
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>

155
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths about human nature that are going</v>

156
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.340
<v Speaker 2>to cause both problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

157
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:31.341
<v Speaker 2>Whatever political or economic system we</v>
<v Speaker 2>find ourselves living in.</v>

158
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I have always had immense respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

159
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the founders of the United States of</v>

160
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.683
<v Speaker 2>America because they were humanists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>separated religion from politics and </v>

161
00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 2>actually took into account some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>truths about human nature.</v>

162
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.950
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a British citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord acton said famously,</v>

163
00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>power corrupts absolute power corrupts </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

164
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.233
<v Speaker 2>And putting boundaries around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulation of too much power by a </v>

165
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.694
<v Speaker 2>single individual or a small group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals either in the political </v>

166
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 2>system or the economic system is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>recipe for danger.</v>

167
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:11.604
<v Speaker 2>And one of the problems we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons we have this climate </v>

168
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.964
<v Speaker 2>crisis is that the large carbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>polluters have accumulated too much </v>

169
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:20.214
<v Speaker 2>power to influence our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they distorted the conversation </v>

170
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:25.914
<v Speaker 2>about climate by using their money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put out climate denial and create false </v>

171
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:35.451
<v Speaker 2>stouts in exactly the same way that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco companies did years ago.</v>

172
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 2>They hired actors and dressed them up as</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors and put them in front of cameras</v>

173
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.224
<v Speaker 2>to falsely reassure people that what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors had found out about smoking </v>

174
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.364
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and lung cancer was not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the carbon polluters are doing </v>

175
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same thing about the climate</v>

176
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.703
<v Speaker 1>except with a half a century of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenched and funding for academic </v>

177
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:57.130
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they don't require actors because</v>

178
00:09:57.131 --> 00:10:00.220
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is a play.</v>

179
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And when you talk about the potency of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility monopolies,</v>

180
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Vice President Al Gore long name to </v>

181
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:11.320
<v Speaker 1>say continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you can accuse al just now.</v>

182
00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:14.860
<v Speaker 1>It's actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your adequacy if you want to be proper,</v>

183
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>your adequacy for is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a formal okay.</v>

184
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Instead of your activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet hell is fine.</v>

185
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause I for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a minute,</v>

186
00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you were laughing at their rigmaroles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>English culture,</v>

187
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Your Highness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

188
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have a title over here by God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.903
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for a person that's been vice </v>

190
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:34.294
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States in a period in which </v>

191
00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:36.724
<v Speaker 1>many of the economic decisions that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>led to the kind of entrenched monopoly </v>

192
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.613
<v Speaker 1>utility monopolies that we are on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian American now there's this suffers </v>

193
00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:45.790
<v Speaker 1>is a pap test or you're a fair word to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

194
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there.</v>

195
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've heard it said before that a lot </v>

196
00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:50.201
<v Speaker 1>of people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

197
00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I left parliamentary left Congress so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could focus on politics.</v>

198
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

199
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.194
<v Speaker 1>Yanis Varoufakis came in here once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said politicians only have power </v>

200
00:10:58.571 --> 00:10:59.404
<v Speaker 1>within the limitations of their role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you find that when you were vice </v>

201
00:11:01.721 --> 00:11:02.554
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States that your power was </v>

202
00:11:03.521 --> 00:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>quite limited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>

203
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:05.594
<v Speaker 1>our ability to be effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with their issues that </v>

204
00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you're passionate about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ecology,</v>

205
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:09.694
<v Speaker 1>we're limited because ultimately stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is nullified by superseding </v>

206
00:11:14.561 --> 00:11:16.270
<v Speaker 1>economic powers and financial interests.</v>

207
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

208
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:18.274
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skillful exercise of political </v>

209
00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:21.484
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which includes the mobilizing of public </v>

210
00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:26.044
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can bring about to more potential for </v>

211
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.590
<v Speaker 2>change then perhaps in any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

212
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 2>But one of the limitations of working in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House is that you cannot focus</v>

213
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.880
<v Speaker 2>only on one issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the responsibility to focus on,</v>

214
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.013
<v Speaker 2>on many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the luxuries that I have now </v>

215
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.913
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freedom to focus almost exclusively </v>

216
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>on the climate crisis and elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crises that are connected to the way</v>

217
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 2>our news media operates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way our economic system operates.</v>

218
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.663
<v Speaker 2>But I see it almost exclusively now </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the lens of the climate crisis </v>

219
00:12:04.701 --> 00:12:05.960
<v Speaker 2>say and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we,</v>

220
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:07.700
<v Speaker 2>we have to make it the top priority.</v>

221
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that sort of a moot point?</v>

222
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.743
<v Speaker 1>Unless there is sort of powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation on an international level </v>

223
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.600
<v Speaker 1>that pre prevent or prohibits </v>
<v Speaker 1>profiteering by these monopoly utilities</v>

224
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.443
<v Speaker 1>that you speak wouldn't affects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the call crises of our planet and </v>

225
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:25.454
<v Speaker 1>say well the way the oil is refined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of profit these companies </v>

226
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.531
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

227
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:29.364
<v Speaker 1>they're more heavily saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like traditional energy resources are </v>

228
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:32.164
<v Speaker 1>more heavily subsidized and modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>renewable energy times as what do we </v>

229
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>make that legal overnight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like stop,</v>

230
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.020
<v Speaker 1>stop subsidizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may go,</v>

231
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.923
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even require a kind of </v>

232
00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:41.244
<v Speaker 1>radicalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause when I see these apocalyptic </v>

233
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 1>river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lake Erie in the GS fires,</v>

234
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 1>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filipino death,</v>

235
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.323
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's not too much to ask to simply </v>

236
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>say right from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget 24 or 2050 or so.</v>

237
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a far flung title of a Kubrickian </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie tomorrow.</v>

238
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.310
<v Speaker 1>No more profit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are not now.</v>

239
00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:03.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

240
00:13:03.661 --> 00:13:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Because the political and economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

241
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 1>which is in a way tissues is conjured by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness of man will not permit</v>

242
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:12.090
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make those kinds of change.</v>

243
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:14.730
<v Speaker 1>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's no more GM anymore.</v>

244
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no Exxon Exxon's close reclaims </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

245
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 2>There was a famous economist who wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

246
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things take longer to happen than you </v>

247
00:13:22.521 --> 00:13:23.354
<v Speaker 2>think they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they happen much faster than </v>

248
00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.204
<v Speaker 2>you thought they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And changes in consciousness sometimes </v>

249
00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:32.450
<v Speaker 2>take time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can occur.</v>

250
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.763
<v Speaker 2>And this climate movement is very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the tradition of previous movements </v>

251
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Speaker 2>that changed consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The abolition of slavery,</v>

252
00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 2>the granting of the right to vote to </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

253
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the civil rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in my country anti apartheid,</v>

254
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.883
<v Speaker 2>most recently the gay rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone had told me even five years </v>

255
00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:57.611
<v Speaker 2>ago that gay marriage would be legal in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all 50 us states and would be accepted,</v>

256
00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:00.350
<v Speaker 2>honored and celebrated by two thirds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the American people,</v>

257
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sure hope so,</v>

258
00:14:02.511 --> 00:14:05.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're being completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic.</v>

259
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.463
<v Speaker 2>But the climate movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these previous movements </v>

260
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.813
<v Speaker 2>eventually gets to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>straw man or discarded and you see the </v>

261
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:15.164
<v Speaker 2>central question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a choice between what is moral </v>

262
00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:18.434
<v Speaker 2>and right and what is immoral and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where we are right at that </v>

263
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.100
<v Speaker 2>tipping point in the climate movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

264
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I hear you well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but prominent civil rights campaign.</v>

265
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:29.514
<v Speaker 1>And one said to me like power will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always yield on civil rights issues </v>

266
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.240
<v Speaker 1>eventually because ultimately it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect their,</v>

267
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.770
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their resources.</v>

268
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 1>But when you go for money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you will face resistance now</v>

269
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:41.781
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

270
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

271
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Penika eight while I was there have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge success.</v>

272
00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>He's in civil rights in the last half </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

273
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.110
<v Speaker 1>One don't have to spend too long on </v>
<v Speaker 1>google to see that.</v>

274
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is a huge ticking clock,</v>

275
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.453
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's not like I want to </v>

276
00:14:59.151 --> 00:14:59.984
<v Speaker 1>encourage his steria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sort of sense that radicalism is </v>

277
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>required and you in your new </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent role to a role as a kind of</v>

278
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>global mench a bodhisattva of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate movement.</v>

279
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of uniquely positioned to spell </v>

280
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like pauses the film.</v>

281
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:16.701
<v Speaker 1>I watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

282
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a serious,</v>

283
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 1>serious crisis and you're educating </v>
<v Speaker 1>people all over the world.</v>

284
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:22.270
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a tremendous job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>

285
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I Amia celebrity to even question you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this subject,</v>

286
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a type of a,</v>

287
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:29.984
<v Speaker 1>seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My intuition is so the recession and </v>

288
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.430
<v Speaker 1>trenching corruption within politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

289
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>the financial industry has these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>sewn up so deeply.</v>

290
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.483
<v Speaker 1>The ordinary people find this so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have purchased that in each of the </v>

291
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>issues that you have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's women's rights,</v>

292
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Speaker 1>African American rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights are partners,</v>

293
00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but blood is spilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great men are imprisoned,</v>

294
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Speaker 1>women die in chains before anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

295
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Do we have this time with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic issue?</v>

296
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Do we not have to evoke the day it is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demons?</v>

297
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Do we not have to speak to level people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the level of their deepest,</v>

298
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>truest self about what kind of world </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to live in,</v>

299
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.583
<v Speaker 1>what they're prepared to sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are prepared to confront and </v>

300
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:06.210
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

301
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't disagree with that at all.</v>

302
00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it is time for people to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

303
00:16:11.491 --> 00:16:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to uh,</v>

304
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm very proud my daughter was arrested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a protest against the new natural gas</v>

305
00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:24.210
<v Speaker 2>pipeline network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

306
00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:25.044
<v Speaker 2>times have changed when a parent says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm so proud of my daughter was </v>

307
00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:27.954
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>

308
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.813
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that say about authority when </v>

309
00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:32.620
<v Speaker 1>a parent is now proud that authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his challenge,</v>

310
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 1>he says all authority is de facto </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt toe.</v>

311
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.063
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump really is it just a </v>

312
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>grotesque exagrid exaggeration as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeding decades and no disrespect,</v>

313
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 1>cause you took part in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrations,</v>

314
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:44.890
<v Speaker 1>but without [inaudible] and without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bama,</v>

315
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't get trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were being coached.</v>

316
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:49.144
<v Speaker 1>We're being lubricated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been fluffed and prepared for the </v>

317
00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:54.190
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the trump thrust.</v>

318
00:16:54.191 --> 00:16:55.024
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if phallic references seem somehow </v>

319
00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 1>appropriate with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

320
00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.480
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 1>we've school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we told people to be individualists,</v>

322
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.610
<v Speaker 1>we taught people to be materialistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>

323
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And now we're surprised when it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>

324
00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:08.550
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist precedent that leads the world.</v>

325
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.703
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would interpret that history </v>

327
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:11.894
<v Speaker 2>differently from the way you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are a lot of good </v>

328
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:20.591
<v Speaker 2>people trapped in bed systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you work for positive change,</v>

329
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there is a backlash.</v>

330
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:26.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think that trump represents of </v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash.</v>

331
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that brexit represented of </v>
<v Speaker 2>backlash.</v>

332
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that for a lot of complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>

333
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:34.124
<v Speaker 2>globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence added to automation of the </v>

334
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 2>growth of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of unhappiness and unrest</v>

335
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.110
<v Speaker 2>about the stagnation of middle income </v>
<v Speaker 2>wages for some decades now.</v>

336
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:45.944
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a demagogue can take advantage of </v>

337
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 2>that and focus it in an irresponsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

338
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>But the next is of each and every one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those issues.</v>

339
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Is it an economic system that will not </v>
<v Speaker 2>yield power?</v>

340
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about,</v>

341
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.783
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we have this system is because </v>

342
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 2>the people that are dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this system works absolutely fine.</v>

343
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to change it.</v>

344
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't care if the planet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>

345
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.210
<v Speaker 2>We don't care if there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

346
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 2>if there's economic inequality across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>

347
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.283
<v Speaker 2>I would see brexit and trump as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive my language as a democratic </v>

348
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 2>population and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you to power.</v>

349
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 2>In both cases you've not looking after </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

350
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Why should we care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should we care?</v>

351
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 2>We've been taught that those limbs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

352
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 2>We've been taught that women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior.</v>

353
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 2>We've been taught all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about gay people.</v>

354
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:29.934
<v Speaker 2>Shepherd hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are bored of hearing it because </v>

355
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.000
<v Speaker 2>they've said for decade after decade </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've witnessed power,</v>

356
00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 2>not com taking care of their interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

357
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:39.444
<v Speaker 2>I think there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this wave of populaced </v>

358
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:46.251
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism is a response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappiness and anxiety that people have</v>

359
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:48.384
<v Speaker 2>been feeling for quite some time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we bring change in spite of </v>

360
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 2>economic interests posing it?</v>

361
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.233
<v Speaker 2>Take one example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti apartheid movement in South </v>

362
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about an economic,</v>

363
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 2>a set of interests of posing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

364
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.343
<v Speaker 2>That was massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Mandela said it's always </v>

365
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.704
<v Speaker 2>impossible until it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh and this kind of change comes about </v>

366
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:18.600
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when the potential for change </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills up,</v>

367
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.630
<v Speaker 2>pushing against a barrier that suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives away and then you see a tremendous</v>

368
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 2>change that people did think was </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible but eventually came.</v>

369
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a generational aspect of</v>

370
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.094
<v Speaker 2>change as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the younger generation now is </v>

371
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.574
<v Speaker 2>far more committed to saving the climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>than those in my generation and I think </v>

372
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:41.214
<v Speaker 2>it's because they've seen that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>night on the news is like a nature hike </v>

373
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 2>through the book of revelation and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the news media doesn't connect the dots,</v>

374
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:48.504
<v Speaker 2>then they connect the dots themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they and their understanding that this </v>

375
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 2>change is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does require a new way of thinking.</v>

376
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.733
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we bring that about or ranting </v>

377
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Speaker 2>and railing against?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has its place working within,</v>

378
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not characterizing you that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way Russell.</v>

379
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.733
<v Speaker 2>I myself have been characterized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way based on the film you ranting and </v>

380
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:13.014
<v Speaker 2>railing guys think that has its place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but patiently working within the system </v>

381
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:18.744
<v Speaker 2>as it exists to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull the levers and press the </v>

382
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:21.894
<v Speaker 2>buttons and make the machinery operate </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a more constructive way also has its </v>

383
00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:26.350
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Owl,</v>

384
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>every one of these examples you give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but think of an alternative</v>

385
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:30.451
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Nelson Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went down for 27 years.</v>

387
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.720
<v Speaker 2>He was prepared to kill and die for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed in.</v>

388
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:37.763
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately I've think if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate it though the apartheid </v>

389
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.200
<v Speaker 2>ended when the economic interests that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were the benefit from a pied found a way</v>

390
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>of maneuvering so that they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain their power</v>

391
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.113
<v Speaker 1>with our pod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having been to South Africa </v>

392
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 1>relatively recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fancy being black.</v>

393
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:54.370
<v Speaker 1>They're much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

394
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't figure this would be a dotted </v>
<v Speaker 1>line moving in and out of town shit,</v>

395
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's of people are still living </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind barb wire,</v>

396
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.283
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with all the way from my limited </v>

397
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like what power does is what is</v>

398
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the bare minimum we can give these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people what is the bare minimum?</v>

399
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So if we aim at bare minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they'll give us.</v>

400
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.133
<v Speaker 1>So for me it seems like what we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is focus on radical annihilation </v>

401
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>overhaul and revolution and that way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might get some kind of parity,</v>

402
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>some kind of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

403
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>do you not think like I understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule changes happening.</v>

404
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>He know that solar power and renewable </v>
<v Speaker 1>energies is better.</v>

405
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 100% right.</v>

406
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.563
<v Speaker 1>So like why not focus on identify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and then make it clear that </v>

407
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 1>these are the targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these companies are the problems.</v>

408
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what I tried to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attack.</v>

409
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I try to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus</v>

410
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.600
<v Speaker 1>so on Koch brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

411
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

412
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 1>like why if you'd like a y con we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

413
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Exxon now has to be nationalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already subsidized.</v>

414
00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.770
<v Speaker 1>We were already paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to own it.</v>

415
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you do that?</v>

416
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:02.314
<v Speaker 2>part of the movie focuses on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation of Exxon Mobil that's now </v>

418
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.324
<v Speaker 2>underway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope they will be held legally </v>

419
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:09.904
<v Speaker 2>accountable for the fact that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>financed climate denial as the Koch </v>

420
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 2>brothers have financed climate denial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

421
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.253
<v Speaker 2>they've tried to fool people into </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking like rises isn't real and now </v>

422
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to fool people into </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that the renewable alternatives</v>

423
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:27.610
<v Speaker 2>are not viable and real as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very insidious.</v>

424
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stdz ncds and the consequence of it is,</v>

425
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I suppose maybe a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

426
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I see the world differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

427
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I recently became a father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a nine month old.</v>

428
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you man.</v>

429
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It's changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so in love with her is incredible.</v>

430
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:41.780
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mabel.</v>

431
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I went for a walk over this morning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fields near where we live.</v>

432
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.753
<v Speaker 1>I look at the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at every time and I think about </v>

433
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our connection to nature is absolute.</v>

434
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

435
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.743
<v Speaker 1>and when you show the images you </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly do in your film an </v>

436
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:55.870
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient sequel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wishing I wasn't,</v>

437
00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:56.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

438
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:57.131
<v Speaker 1>good title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>

439
00:22:57.131 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

440
00:22:58.151 --> 00:22:58.984
<v Speaker 1>It's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got the word convenient cause </v>

441
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Mary at apple now vice vice metta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

442
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.103
<v Speaker 1>like it makes me feel that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one has to nurture the inherent </v>

443
00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>connection we have with this planet.</v>

444
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.403
<v Speaker 1>We have to personalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things have become commodified is </v>

445
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:14.644
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling to see the significance of </v>

446
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.433
<v Speaker 1>broad global issues when globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst it is bought sort of a commodity </v>

447
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>revolution and we've all got wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

448
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're delightful.</v>

449
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 1>What it's also done is this turned us </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a planet of consumers that C,</v>

450
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.113
<v Speaker 1>and this is why at the beginning of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview I spoke about spirituality </v>

451
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>because I think this is where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation must take place.</v>

452
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 1>The way we regard the exterior world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we regard God ourselves and</v>

453
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 1>our role on this planet as you evidently</v>
<v Speaker 1>do as a servant.</v>

454
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.133
<v Speaker 1>You are obviously living in service now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other feeling that I will let you </v>

455
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.030
<v Speaker 1>know if I dare piece of boulders to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak for most people.</v>

456
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I think most people think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians are corrupt,</v>

457
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.263
<v Speaker 1>people in positions of power are </v>
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy and manipulative lawyers </v>

458
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.473
<v Speaker 1>and that we should divorce ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>from power and and I think to have a </v>

459
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:07.124
<v Speaker 1>person in your position who has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the curtain who must know things </v>

460
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that if you uttered them out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life would be at risk.</v>

461
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 1>To see a person like q embracing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in this way is very,</v>

462
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:18.284
<v Speaker 1>very heartening for ordinary people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>identify and target who the problem is </v>
