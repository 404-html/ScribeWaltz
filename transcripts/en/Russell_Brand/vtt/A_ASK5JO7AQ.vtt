00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Welcome John to the scheme of Russell </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.953
<v Speaker 1>My guest today is Andy [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accomplished presenter and writer </v>

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.883
<v Speaker 1>and he's the cofounder and voice of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headspace app in his early twenties </v>

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:13.134
<v Speaker 1>midway through a university degree in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports science and he made the </v>

5
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>unexpected decision to travel to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Himalayas to study meditation.</v>

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.514
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the beginning of a 10 year </v>

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which took him around the world.</v>

8
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:23.994
<v Speaker 1>Como La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culminating with ordination as a Tibet </v>

9
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and Buddhist monk in northern India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's transitioned back to normal life in</v>

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.314
<v Speaker 1>2004 sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm training briefly at Moscow state </v>

11
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.124
<v Speaker 1>circus before returning to London to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete a degree in circus arts with </v>

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:39.894
<v Speaker 1>the conservatoire of dance and drama </v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst drawing up the early plans for </v>

13
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>what was later to become headspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome andy to under the skin.</v>

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.403
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though under the skin in this </v>

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.564
<v Speaker 1>instance is taking place in your studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you actually welcomed the </v>

16
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>headspace.</v>

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very generous of you to,</v>

18
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>we've never done this before and under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin we've always recorded it,</v>

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in various places.</v>

20
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>In London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Los Angeles now.</v>

21
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:10.251
<v Speaker 1>We're in a one of the facilities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>headspace and it's wonderful to be here.</v>

22
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.564
<v Speaker 1>The reason that I was strongly motivated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet you was because people kept </v>

23
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>mentioning headspace in under the skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Stafford,</v>

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the a survival expert and I call him the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grunge bear grylls.</v>

25
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.264
<v Speaker 1>Not that I don't love bear grylls would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be straight standard bear grylls </v>

26
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>vanilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy too,</v>

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's Stafford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Nirvana version.</v>

28
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
<v Speaker 1>He loves headspace and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were mentioning headspace to me </v>

29
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I'm going to have to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are headspace.</v>

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming in and this by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

31
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:44.580

<v Speaker 1>you're very welcome.</v>

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.750

<v Speaker 1>if you're in La,</v>

33

<v Speaker 1>this is lovely to hear your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I will take you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you up on that.</v>

35
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really very generous of you.</v>

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Now what as defined to headspace thus </v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

37
00:01:56.071 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>even though I know it's been a 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey is it seems to me and and I,</v>

38
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:05.351
<v Speaker 1>I used the APP myself that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a meditation accessible,</v>

39
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

40
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>quill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I think you are.</v>

41
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I love the little animation videos at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they're like,</v>

42
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:14.814
<v Speaker 1>what the reference points are for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that I don't know quite what </v>

43
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like him.</v>

44
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I love your tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to someone,</v>

45
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm over here acting at the moment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to another actor on set </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about meditation,</v>

47
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>the challenges that he faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

48
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>you want to do headspace mate?</v>

49
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like a British bloke </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

50
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down.</v>

51
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to shut your eyes.</v>

52
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not complicated.</v>

53
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you've watched the video.</v>

54
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to watch that now.</v>

55
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I sort of like what I feel like part</v>

56
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>of what I've been trying to do myself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

57
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>not meditation because I'm not qualified</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring it to people,</v>

58
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the conversation around </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality,</v>

59
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make it more accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me how this journey began for you.</v>

60
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journey into</v>

61
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>meditation or headspace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More specifically,</v>

62
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I think initially headspace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you,</v>

63
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>when I'm going to set up an APP and </v>
<v Speaker 2>popularized meditation,</v>

64
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>how have you done this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to say,</v>

66
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

67
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cofounder,</v>

68
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.660
<v Speaker 2>so the other cofounder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich,</v>

69
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich pearson,</v>

70
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>so very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dear friend now.</v>

71
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.683
<v Speaker 2>was something that we came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and we've had an amazing team </v>

73
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>of people and also I love so much love </v>
<v Speaker 2>and support from people along the way.</v>

74
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I think an ungrateful person because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the real deal.</v>

75
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I knew you're a monk so you're not this </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant idea of Ed space and I'm going</v>

76
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.124
<v Speaker 2>to smash it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're obviously is totally humble </v>

77
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 2>person to tune into the limitless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the truth as well.</v>

78
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We meet rich,</v>

79
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

80
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left.</v>

81
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I left the monastery and,</v>

82
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>and decided to start teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing,</v>

83
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one-to-one in a clinic back in,</v>

84
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 2>back in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was,</v>

85
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll look at the circus thing later.</v>

86
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kind of after the,</v>

87
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>the circus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of okay.</v>

88
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.773
<v Speaker 2>I knew kind of the language that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to use and w and I knew by then </v>

89
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.554
<v Speaker 2>what techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of felt would work outside of </v>

90
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 2>the need to even feel compelled to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

91
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And why did you think I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>popularize meditation?</v>

92
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>What was the sense that you had that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was necessary?</v>

93
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is more tricky cause it wasn't,</v>

94
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a plan.</v>

95
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>So in the same way people asking you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you go away and become a monk?</v>

96
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I felt an overwhelming sense that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was what I had to do.</v>

97
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't able to necessarily put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into two words.</v>

98
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't come up with a list of pros</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cons of,</v>

99
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>of being a monk and not being a monk in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way when I left the monastery,</v>

100
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess if it's helpful to take a step </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and when I was teaching meditation,</v>

101
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
<v Speaker 2>so I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monastery had asked me to teach at a</v>

103
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.754
<v Speaker 2>meditation center in Moscow and I ended </v>
<v Speaker 2>up living there for just over four </v>

104
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four and a half years.</v>

105
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.273
<v Speaker 2>And I would see different types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and I'd often get expats coming </v>

106
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:57.364
<v Speaker 2>along and they really wanted to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation and they really wanted the </v>

107
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.124
<v Speaker 2>benefits of meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't necessarily want to </v>

108
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.424
<v Speaker 2>adopt a faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't necessarily want to chat to </v>

109
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.903
<v Speaker 2>a guy in robes and to come into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of place where there was a lot of </v>

110
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>ritual and tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

111
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of me thinking,</v>

112
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.803
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this need and what's more </v>

113
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 2>important to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it teaching meditation or is it being</v>

114
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.314
<v Speaker 2>a monk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt very strongly that teaching </v>

115
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>meditation was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more useful and that I could present</v>

116
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>it in a way that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't matter whether I was wearing a</v>

118
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>shirt and tie or whether I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I was wearing kind of ropes,</v>

119
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the beginning.</v>

120
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.664
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the best thing about being a </v>

121
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.614
<v Speaker 2>monk?</v>

122
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.363
<v Speaker 2>Strange as it may sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not having anything because there's </v>

123
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 2>nothing to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

124
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>freedom you give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give away.</v>

125
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is strange because you're living </v>

126
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 2>within four walls and it's very kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized in some ways.</v>

127
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.730
<v Speaker 2>But within that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.643
<v Speaker 2>freedoms from within and there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an inner feeling of freedom and there's </v>

129
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to achieve anything.</v>

130
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to prove anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about losing </v>

131
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You own nothing that there's,</v>

132
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>so there's a real sense of freedom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

133
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.363
<v Speaker 2>In your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a Tibetan monastery in the </v>

134
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Himalayas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that correct?</v>

135
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

136
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 2>I started in Himalayas and then I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Burma and trained in a,</v>

137
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>in a Burmese monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually I ended up kind of,</v>

138
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to Tibetan monastery and </v>

139
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>doing five years.</v>

140
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's about in tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship with the guru,</v>

143
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I teach her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of sacred thing,</v>

144
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is your teacher?</v>

145
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

146
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>

147
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 2>there are different types of teachers </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the way,</v>

148
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there were more kind of instructor </v>

149
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of type teachers are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who they're the real deal,</v>

150
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've put in the time and they've done</v>

151
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:50.474
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>

152
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>there may be not kind of considered sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like as a,</v>

153
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:57.941
<v Speaker 2>as a guru or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone who was incredibly important</v>

154
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.600
<v Speaker 2>in my own personal kind of journey was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

155
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.443
<v Speaker 2>he's an Irishman called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Donald and Donald Donald was a </v>

156
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 2>real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

157
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he trained and he did just over 12 years</v>

158
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in retreat,</v>

159
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 2>in longterm retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

160
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>where did you encounter him and were </v>
<v Speaker 2>already done them 12 years.</v>

161
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 2>So he did 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

162
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.844
<v Speaker 2>he was on his way to the Himalayas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he stopped off at a monastery </v>

163
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] monastery in Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is back in the 60s.</v>

164
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It just opened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just started.</v>

165
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.713
<v Speaker 2>And the Abbot of the monastery persuaded</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to stay and do a six month retreat </v>

166
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 2>rather than go to India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he finished a six month or to treat.</v>

167
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:37.251
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

168
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.084
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just about to start the first </v>

169
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 2>three and a half year retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the first one in the west.</v>

171
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.004
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Tibetans have this three and a half </v>

172
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 2>year retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 2>would you like to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Oh yeah,</v>

174
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fairly easy kind of going guy.</v>

175
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

176
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try it.</v>

177
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And so he did that one and then he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>another one and then he did another one.</v>

178
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And by the time I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd,</v>

179
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>he'd left the monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was never a monk,</v>

180
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>so he was in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 2>he went through that process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did it as a lay person.</v>

182
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.483
<v Speaker 2>by the time I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in Moscow and that was my main </v>

184
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of reason for going out to Moscow </v>
<v Speaker 2>to meet him and train with him.</v>

185
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 2>And you wanted to meet him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want it.</v>

186
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Why did you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just met the,</v>

187
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 2>the Abbot of the monastery in Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd gone back there and,</v>

188
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend invite me along and I remember </v>

189
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 2>just seeing the picture of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>and it said that he was at the Moscow </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of center and there was just,</v>

191
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>there was something about him which </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonated.</v>

192
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 2>And I felt really strongly that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

193
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.310
<v Speaker 2>there was something for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to better understand and learn.</v>

194
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>And because he'd gone through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey,</v>

195
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 2>he'd come to as a westerner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd gone through,</v>

196
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 2>he'd kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my understanding of it is,</v>

197
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:50.010
<v Speaker 2>is that he'd sort of transcended the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

198
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:50.844
<v Speaker 2>the tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was no longer kind of stuck with </v>

199
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>the words and the concept and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frameworks.</v>

200
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>And so he kind of operated outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

201
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:03.231
<v Speaker 2>which allowed him to communicate in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way which just struck a chord,</v>

202
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.163
<v Speaker 2>which I'd never really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced before because I'd always </v>

203
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>been in foreign monasteries where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

204
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it is and it's like this.</v>

205
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.064
<v Speaker 2>And always the same language was used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he kind of cut through that for </v>

206
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 2>me and helped me see in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a really different way.</v>

207
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.213
<v Speaker 2>I think that somehow you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously significant as you go </v>

208
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:20.604
<v Speaker 2>on along with your partner and your team</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become the founder of headspace that </v>

209
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.821
<v Speaker 2>are significant men or for you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that didn't use the conventional</v>

210
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>traditional lexicon by in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>colloquially taught,</v>

211
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.173
<v Speaker 2>taught meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is precisely what headspace does </v>

212
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 2>now for 20 million users.</v>

213
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>So I can see why he would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant figure,</v>

214
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 2>but it also seems significant to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy,</v>

215
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:42.650
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

216
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 2>impulse to connect with this guy seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>very intuitive,</v>

217
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>very instinctive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that about do you think?</v>

218
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

219
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I'm just kind of rash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend,</v>

220
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I tend to kind of move from instinct I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say or you know,</v>

221
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to over overthink things.</v>

222
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:01.284
<v Speaker 2>So whether it was kind of going away and</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming a monk and that felt like just </v>

223
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:08.140
<v Speaker 2>so intuitively the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

224
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I did it in the same did you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

225
00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean from Bristol in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't ya?</v>

226
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 2>You're just a bloke from Bristol in </v>
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>

227
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that's suddenly you're a monk in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Himalayas,</v>

228
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit where you're nearly in the</v>

229
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:19.400
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause my mate Gareth,</v>

230
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.323
<v Speaker 2>which uses the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his biography sounds like a lie that </v>

231
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd make up to impress a girl for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

232
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Then I was in the circus then I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity in for a couple of weeks.</v>

233
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 2>They removed that part.</v>

234
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Keegan Mad Celtic life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sounds,</v>

235
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>it does sound bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you,</v>

236
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

237
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 2>there's no way of explaining away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monk to circus monk the clown bit.</v>

238
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.360
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically until the age of 21,</v>

239
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I competed in gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kind of,</v>

240
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.914
<v Speaker 2>I had the acrobatic kind of background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I then went to become a monk and for 10 </v>

241
00:10:58.451 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 2>years I didn't know exercise and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was something that I really,</v>

242
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.140
<v Speaker 2>really missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as I had the opportunity,</v>

243
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't exercise as a monk.</v>

244
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.700
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as I finished being a monk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

245
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.870
<v Speaker 2>why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he's meditating all day?</v>

246
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sitting around,</v>

247
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 2>sitting around with your eyes closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing anything.</v>

248
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.283
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and I was desperate to kind of go </v>

249
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 2>back and do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

250
00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:22.730
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first thing I did when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped being a monk.</v>

251
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

252
00:11:24.641 --> 00:11:25.474
<v Speaker 2>I went back to do an acrobatics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I transitioned a bit of </v>

253
00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>extremists mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one minute,</v>

254
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.913
<v Speaker 2>next minute year moncton and going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a circus now it sounds like that </v>

255
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.893
<v Speaker 2>focus and concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he seems like he must </v>

256
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:38.684
<v Speaker 2>have and also as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say when I listened to you on </v>

257
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 2>headspace interest in tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say other stuff like it's a like you</v>

258
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:45.254
<v Speaker 2>must have a good relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>inner life concentration and focus for </v>

259
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:50.720
<v Speaker 2>an acrobat concentration and focus for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gymnasts,</v>

260
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 2>concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus and aspect might say of uh,</v>

261
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.773
<v Speaker 2>of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're you but you pursued the </v>

262
00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.910
<v Speaker 2>monastic path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

263
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:00.783
<v Speaker 2>we briefly spoke upstairs and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>monastic life is determined by a </v>

264
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

265
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:06.544
<v Speaker 2>You get up at a certain time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat certain things and evidently </v>

266
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to do any bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>

267
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 2>So like how long did you live that life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I lived there on and off.</v>

268
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 2>So I started as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a lay person,</v>

269
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in northern India.</v>

271
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And then so I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a novice monk,</v>

272
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.420
<v Speaker 2>so I moved to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>moved to Burma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

274
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 2>and then I went and went on to become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monk in Tibet.</v>

275
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Introducers over a period of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 10 of 10 years.</v>

276
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.993
<v Speaker 2>And these transitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they marked by Sarah many and </v>

277
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>commitment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are these transitions?</v>

278
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 2>How would I mark [inaudible] some are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

279
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:41.524
<v Speaker 2>I think when you become a novice monk </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ceremony and I think it </v>

280
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 2>becomes a bit more formal as you become </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fully ordained monk.</v>

281
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:47.944
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't bring the pictures are </v>

282
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 2>upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm definitely going to look,</v>

283
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you've got shaved that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's different.</v>

284
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean did you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause when I first met you it just then </v>

285
00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.231
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

286
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 2>he's a monk back are sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 2>people that got a vibe.</v>

288
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I've tried to lighten it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you knew though,</v>

289
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 2>cause he knew I used to be probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

290
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Probably there was confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also also there was the sense I I me</v>

291
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:13.384
<v Speaker 2>my background in addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sense when people have like we have </v>

292
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.014
<v Speaker 2>drug addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not present like well whatever </v>

293
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.603
<v Speaker 2>type of drug it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there think mostly their life when </v>

294
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:21.874
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking drugs is just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that they have to deal with in </v>

295
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 2>order to get back to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have spiritual meditation.</v>

296
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:31.231
<v Speaker 2>People I impact it has on me is it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>me vibrate a bit or I don't know,</v>

297
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps me up.</v>

298
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

299
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:36.920
<v Speaker 2>and I remember when I was a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're not looking at us 25 seven so</v>

300
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 2>when I was 27 I met this gaze there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a sort of hardcore swami rather</v>

301
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 2>not swamis from the Harry Krishna sect.</v>

302
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.503
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I met him it was like I got a </v>

303
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 2>real buzz off it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a meat and a beautiful woman</v>

304
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:48.561
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

305
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

306
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 2>I really want to impress him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like him a lot of goal.</v>

307
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 2>It so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I recognize,</v>

308
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 2>and then when you read autobiography of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Yogi,</v>

309
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Yogananda talks about his guru,</v>

310
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 2>his great love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great passion.</v>

311
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I think,</v>

312
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talking just now about kind of gurus</v>

313
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.020
<v Speaker 2>and stuff and I'll start off with </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>

314
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 2>If I think about sort of the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I met who I would consider to be sort of</v>

315
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.480
<v Speaker 2>like guru type sort of status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that that Irish it Donald?</v>

316
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.421
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

317
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a chap called his holiness the come</v>

318
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>up and who escaped from Tibet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

319
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>when he was 17 years old because of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese occupation and I met him back in</v>

320
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.053
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are quite serious threat to his </v>

321
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

322
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 2>So I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

323
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.061
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

324
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 2>late 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

325
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 2>And I remember the f even I knew nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>

326
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.263
<v Speaker 2>And the first time I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can own only described that moment as </v>

327
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.960
<v Speaker 2>completely limitless in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whether you define limitless bye,</v>

328
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 2>bye love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bye space.</v>

329
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 2>By time there was a feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection,</v>

330
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 2>which I had never experienced up until </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of point.</v>

331
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 2>And it was without any of the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say that the baggage of association</v>

332
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:06.884
<v Speaker 2>or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really kind of know much about </v>

333
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 17 year old,</v>

334
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 2>17 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was like a kid.</v>

335
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 2>He was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

336
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.873
<v Speaker 2>he was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could have been 80 or 90 years </v>

337
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.544
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was something about him which was </v>

338
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 2>completely timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ageless.</v>

339
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.403
<v Speaker 2>And that for me was the beginning of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different kind of journey into </v>

340
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

341
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to you in retrospect?</v>

342
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

343
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it shattered a lot of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusions I might have had,</v>

344
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but it also was the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

345
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a journey of devotion as well.</v>

346
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think devotion is often kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about in,</v>

347
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 2>in different different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about a blind devotion,</v>

348
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.380
<v Speaker 2>but a real sense of something being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was personified by that person,</v>

349
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.434
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't really about that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something kind of bigger and yet </v>

350
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>there was a a direction for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

351
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 2>whether you think of his devotion or </v>
<v Speaker 2>love or whatever there was,</v>

352
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 2>it felt like it had a very definite sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of direction and purpose.</v>

353
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 2>So I felt just the connection that I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

354
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I'd never experienced before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inescapably Andy,</v>

355
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about quite profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

356
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.493
<v Speaker 2>profound and powerful energies that some</v>
<v Speaker 2>wallet supersede the colloquial and </v>

357
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:32.141
<v Speaker 2>secularized world of the headspace APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think he's a brilliant,</v>

358
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:33.014
<v Speaker 2>brilliant tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of the compromise it's </v>

359
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 2>continually made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

360
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:39.470
<v Speaker 2>when reaching out to what we would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.313
<v Speaker 2>we would call secular people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonreligious people or people that </v>

362
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 2>aren't spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you continually.</v>

363
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.773
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a thing just to help you </v>

364
00:16:45.581 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just making more effective at work.</v>

365
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.853
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how do we fit this together </v>

366
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.983
<v Speaker 2>with this stuff that I'm kind of into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which like seven year old kid that's </v>

367
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 2>like the golden child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's conveying some limitless,</v>

368
00:16:57.021 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 2>infinite wisdom makes these person are </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

369
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you sense God in someone or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

370
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 2>and again that's a complicated word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the limitless to use your term,</v>

371
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>how do we align that with the needs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>headspace?</v>

372
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Is it because you look at them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate things or what?</v>

373
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I really don't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's um,</v>

374
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>it's been a journey that has just kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of evolved and um,</v>

375
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.003
<v Speaker 2>I feel like w to suggest it's gone full </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle suggests that something has been </v>

376
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean it in that way.</v>

377
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean simply I've been on a journey </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I started off with one particular </v>

378
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.284
<v Speaker 2>kind of language in a way of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world and thinking about </v>

379
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>things I found.</v>

380
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I went through another kind of period </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was using different language and</v>

381
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world in a different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of way.</v>

382
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.960
<v Speaker 2>And then I came back to a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm using the old language but to,</v>

383
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 2>to kind of refer back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me they're not different.</v>

384
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:55.881
<v Speaker 2>And I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the danger of kind of having any</v>

385
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 2>kind of labels like normal people or </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual people,</v>

386
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that is defined that the essence</v>
<v Speaker 2>is defined by being present.</v>

387
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.883
<v Speaker 2>And I think as soon as we take on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>label of being spiritual or </v>

388
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:09.744
<v Speaker 2>nonspiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we stepped away from the essence </v>

389
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.643
<v Speaker 2>that we're trying to kind of describe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't feel like there's a </v>

390
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely,</v>

391
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about staff using </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

393
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.883
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't talk about this kind of in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the APP because I don't feel like </v>

394
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:26.184
<v Speaker 2>it's the most helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most relevant thing for the person </v>

395
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:29.034
<v Speaker 2>coming to the APP.</v>

396
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 2>But as we kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we kind of dig a bit deeper,</v>

397
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

398
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 2>is relevant to my personal kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>

399
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that informs kind of what has</v>

400
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 2>gone into the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

401
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Nothing in the APP is not my own idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is kind of been invented by me.</v>

402
00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It's really me just kind of taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>other people's wisdom and trying to kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bring it together in a way that feels</v>

404
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:56.310
<v Speaker 2>right for people like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

405
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 2>who don't live in a monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

406
00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no,</v>

407
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:03.921
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't in any way undermine or </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise the content of the APP to say</v>

408
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:05.994
<v Speaker 2>that someone that's been a monk for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years is going to have had different </v>

409
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:11.920
<v Speaker 2>experiences than someone who's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up their phone and going off and</v>

410
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 2>online 10 minutes where I'm not worrying</v>
<v Speaker 2>about my job or wherever it is.</v>

411
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.193
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously distinct is obviously </v>

412
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 2>something that you've dedicated a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal of exploration toward.</v>

413
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's many things I'm fascinated </v>
<v Speaker 2>about here,</v>

414
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 2>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like when we talk about the,</v>

415
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:28.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

416
00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the devotion that is in here within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guru student system,</v>

417
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the discipline and </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that were,</v>

418
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalent in your monastic life,</v>

419
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.983
<v Speaker 2>it is in escapable that these models </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been extricated from western life </v>

420
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a key.</v>

421
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Must be a huge challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

422
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

423
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if in a perfect kind of scenario like </v>

424
00:19:58.351 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so,</v>

425
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.243
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes come into the APP and </v>

426
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 2>they get to a point where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

427
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did you train,</v>

429
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did you do retreat?</v>

430
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:09.434
<v Speaker 2>As you kind of want to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate kind of that a little bit </v>

431
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

432
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 2>so the people who kind of follow on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go go down that route.</v>

433
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And so sometimes I do feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

434
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:18.804
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a journey that can be delivered through </v>

435
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.863
<v Speaker 2>the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one part of the journey and </v>

436
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe at some stage some people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go off and explore that,</v>

437
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the APP as well.</v>

438
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.141
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

439
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

440
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:33.054
<v Speaker 2>it's a departure point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like good way of learning </v>

441
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

442
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.583
<v Speaker 2>but another one of the things that must </v>
<v Speaker 2>be significant and it's something that </v>

443
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 2>we've touched upon already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the use of language.</v>

444
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.440
<v Speaker 2>The words don't really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 2>we were talking before</v>

446
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>andy about how as soon as you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about concepts,</v>

447
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes complicated.</v>

448
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:55.384
<v Speaker 1>It becomes complicated because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with something somewhat </v>

449
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 1>intangible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely feel like the more,</v>

450
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.110
<v Speaker 1>the more we talk about</v>

451
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.043
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the further we move away from the </v>

452
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could just say,</v>

453
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:13.270
<v Speaker 2>and not say anything for now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

454
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 2>like you got to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

455
00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:16.854
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely feel like that there has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be some kind of conversation and it has </v>

456
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>to be signposts and has to be guidance </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

457
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.680
<v Speaker 2>there's an old parley kind of term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

458
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 2>and he's Kalina Mctier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

459
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's from the lion king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

460
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.320
<v Speaker 2>God common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

461
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's a warthog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

462
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.730
<v Speaker 2>The poly walked Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

463
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think there's,</v>

464
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.333
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean that it means trusted </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend or kind of like trusted guide </v>

465
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me that's the role that it's,</v>

466
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:51.044
<v Speaker 2>it's how to be kind of a rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of laying on concepts and saying </v>

467
00:21:56.351 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you should think in a certain way or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should live in a certain</v>

468
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.710
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more kind of,</v>

469
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.100
<v Speaker 1>okay look I went away and did this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

470
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I find it really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I've done a little bit more than,</v>

471
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.913
<v Speaker 1>than some other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit less than some other </v>

472
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:11.044
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really happy to be like a </v>

473
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:17.050
<v Speaker 1>trusted guide into to use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and to try to find a language</v>

474
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.423
<v Speaker 1>that worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my hope is that it works for others </v>

475
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:22.280
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely do.</v>

476
00:22:22.281 --> 00:22:23.750
<v Speaker 1>And it really brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

477
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Come on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've cracked it now.</v>

478
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.863
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the great lies of our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me is the idea that the </v>

479
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:37.290
<v Speaker 1>personal liberty is freedom and personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty means that we can be who we want</v>

480
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm starting to understand that that</v>

481
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>is not the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no such thing as a vacuum.</v>

482
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.420
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninfluenced freedom.</v>

483
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.563
<v Speaker 1>What we have is I think we live in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremist consumerist culture that our </v>

484
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:54.124
<v Speaker 1>time is deeply influenced by ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all pervasive that we can't see them </v>

485
00:22:58.331 --> 00:22:59.164
<v Speaker 1>because they are everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like trying to identify </v>

486
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 1>individual molecules of oxygen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

487
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.960
<v Speaker 1>So like with our opposing structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without alternative structures,</v>

488
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.830
<v Speaker 1>our role in civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our role in society,</v>

489
00:23:10.831 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 1>but it comes to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We consume,</v>

490
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to look at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

491
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>We consume our politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we consume our news.</v>

492
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:18.634
<v Speaker 1>We have show business politicians now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a great necessity for </v>

493
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:28.420
<v Speaker 1>spirituality to get a foothold in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary life.</v>

494
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Technology is going to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>

495
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.833
<v Speaker 1>Headspace is a perfect product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you surprised by the way that it's </v>

496
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 1>gone by the place that you found </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself?</v>

497
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised the people have warm </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of practicing meditation.</v>

498
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's</v>

499
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 2>timeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is universal.</v>

500
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 2>It's been around for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The need,</v>

501
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:52.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people experienced anxiety and sadness </v>

502
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.950
<v Speaker 2>and anger back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

503
00:23:56.951 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>there's in the same way that they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

504
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I think the difference is you say now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost like there's a bit of a</v>

505
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:04.900
<v Speaker 2>squeeze kind of and that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding now,</v>

506
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.753
<v Speaker 2>squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling more overwhelmed by all those </v>

507
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think yeah,</v>

508
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:11.144
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's perhaps no surprise that more than </v>

509
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:13.424
<v Speaker 2>ever people are looking for for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My only concern about it is that in the </v>

510
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.033
<v Speaker 2>sense of urgency and need the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes in people's minds at least a </v>

511
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.210
<v Speaker 2>a fix rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like how,</v>

512
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 2>how I'm feeling stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I fix that and not sleeping?</v>

513
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 2>How do I fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than,</v>

514
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.443
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I understand my life or my mind </v>

515
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to stress or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to sleep?</v>

516
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.430
<v Speaker 2>And that meditation is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

517
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not about fixing something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing something.</v>

518
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like that's a very delicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>dance and balance that we're all kind of</v>

519
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 2>engaged in state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

520
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand offer people the aspirin</v>

521
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.573
<v Speaker 2>because they have a headache and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should treat the headache and at the </v>

522
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 2>same time say wood's not about tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>treating the symptom.</v>

523
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>It's about looking at and understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underlying cause.</v>

524
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.563
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it have the potential to be </v>

525
00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:07.820
<v Speaker 2>extremely dangerous in revolutionary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these ideas in that,</v>

526
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.683
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the natural end </v>
<v Speaker 2>point is it kind of throwing off the </v>

527
00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 2>shackles of our contemporary way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

528
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:14.264
<v Speaker 2>beyond even the external structures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps more importantly the internal </v>

529
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 2>structures that make us victim to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>external ones.</v>

530
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people start to say,</v>

531
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more to life than consuming,</v>

532
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 2>there's more to life than what I do for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a job.</v>

533
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.550
<v Speaker 2>What happens if community start forming </v>
<v Speaker 2>around different idea?</v>

534
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 2>What happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

535
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting idea.</v>

536
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's quite an exciting idea and I</v>

537
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:37.604
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it has to be this or that </v>

538
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.793
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it has to be so kind of </v>

539
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 2>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

540
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I personally feel like it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to,</v>

541
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.640
<v Speaker 2>to live in the world with the world as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

542
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.953
<v Speaker 2>but two at the same time to do that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of awareness and compassion and </v>

543
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that we're taking </v>

544
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for living the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we choose to live.</v>

545
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some ripples from that.</v>

546
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully the other people around us </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of benefit from.</v>

547
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 2>And maybe even some of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>might kind of think,</v>

548
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

549
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:13.334
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll do a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So rather than it being sort of coerce </v>

550
00:26:15.251 --> 00:26:18.170
<v Speaker 2>if in nature or any kind of sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing,</v>

551
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.004
<v Speaker 2>it's more just taking responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's own sanity and a health and </v>

552
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:25.570
<v Speaker 2>relationships and then kind of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens</v>

553
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.023
<v Speaker 1>as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're quite right about that </v>

554
00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:33.480
<v Speaker 1>because I was thinking just as you spoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are different men.</v>

555
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.260
<v Speaker 1>You and I that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:39.090
<v Speaker 1>a monk and by nature is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that that journey is about,</v>

557
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.520
<v Speaker 1>there is some distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some discretion,</v>

558
00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:42.354
<v Speaker 1>some separation monastery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that sometimes when I was </v>

559
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:46.300
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I met that man,</v>

560
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>that man is a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

561
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:48.384
<v Speaker 1>do you think I should become a monk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you think he laughed at me when I </v>

562
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 1>said it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He laughed at the idea.</v>

563
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was then,</v>

564
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

565
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes wish that I were,</v>

566
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.833
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes wish that there were robes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't know what my position is in </v>

567
00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:01.340
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

568
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not who I am.</v>

569
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to talk about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

570
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I,</v>

571
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:07.531
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

572
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 1>but because I am a person that has found</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh very,</v>

573
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 1>very appealing and corrupting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found drugs very,</v>

574
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:17.180
<v Speaker 1>very engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like senses.</v>

575
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I like sensuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the body.</v>

576
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.860
<v Speaker 1>So I've had to come to meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>

577
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:26.020
<v Speaker 1>spirituality with a gun to my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

578
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 1>pretty much it's worth saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

579
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I've not always been a monk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

580
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:31.703
<v Speaker 1>so there were tight for a bit lunatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>biography and 21 years when I wasn't </v>

581
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.100
<v Speaker 1>monk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't been a monk now,</v>

582
00:27:39.101 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

583
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.330
<v Speaker 2>for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

584
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.101
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

586
00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a wife and,</v>

587
00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:46.210
<v Speaker 2>and I have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

588
00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it's in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>

589
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.810
<v Speaker 2>it might be different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the same way,</v>

590
00:27:49.811 --> 00:27:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm unaffected by those things.</v>

591
00:27:52.661 --> 00:27:53.494
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drawn to my wife because she was </v>

592
00:27:56.051 --> 00:27:56.884
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and I found her beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't know if that's what </v>

593
00:28:00.431 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

594
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

595
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.790
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it seems that you are,</v>

596
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.430
<v Speaker 1>when you answered that question about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me saying,</v>

597
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.980
<v Speaker 1>because what I see when people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about spirituality,</v>

598
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I believe that like a connection to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.600
<v Speaker 1>like the softly even take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's at the extreme end of being</v>

600
00:28:19.601 --> 00:28:23.560
<v Speaker 1>in a monastery somewhere in Tibet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to headspace APP,</v>

601
00:28:23.561 --> 00:28:27.730
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a true for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic relationship with this self in</v>

602
00:28:27.731 --> 00:28:29.710
<v Speaker 1>inverted commerce that brings about </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

603
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good deep truth in that.</v>

604
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And the more people that have access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

605
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.674
<v Speaker 1>the truth is likely that that would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitless repercussions and will bring </v>

606
00:28:40.061 --> 00:28:43.780
<v Speaker 1>about a lot of change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that,</v>

607
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:44.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

608
00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we cannot start sort of like waving</v>

609
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:48.124
<v Speaker 1>flags and bashing down doors and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more ridiculous than when you </v>

610
00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:54.220
<v Speaker 1>read of conflict in Buddhist countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and very full of like what's going on.</v>

611
00:28:54.221 --> 00:28:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You've missed the point I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any religion really.</v>

612
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the believe leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've missed the point.</v>

613
00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

614
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.403
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about expansionism I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>about evangelism because I feel that </v>

615
00:29:07.761 --> 00:29:09.980
<v Speaker 1>there are ideas that are need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be spread.</v>

616
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think within the limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation of contemporary politics as</v>

617
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:15.484
<v Speaker 1>solution will be found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're just pulling </v>

618
00:29:17.061 --> 00:29:20.150
<v Speaker 1>mutations and versions of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people think that they were</v>

619
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.030
<v Speaker 1>experiencing a time of grotesqueness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

620
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:25.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nostalgia,</v>

621
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.960
<v Speaker 1>ethno nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old ideas,</v>

622
00:29:26.961 --> 00:29:30.590
<v Speaker 1>this weird twitching flinching dinosaur </v>
<v Speaker 1>corpse thing with a wig on.</v>

623
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.643
<v Speaker 1>There's like a bit Kuli at time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel that precisely list solution </v>

624
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:38.270
<v Speaker 1>is to get in touch with essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essence as you described the Andy and,</v>

625
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.280
<v Speaker 1>and I feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:29:40.281 --> 00:29:41.114
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>you are</v>

628
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.993
<v Speaker 2>doing this thing that's means at 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people are meditating now and </v>

629
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.643
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you that's doing it and it's good </v>

630
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:51.334
<v Speaker 2>that these good and episode and perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and necessary that you are a man that </v>

631
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:59.830
<v Speaker 2>has lived as a monk for 10 years and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives a lay person life.</v>

632
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Because that means that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>authenticity.</v>

633
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Because if it was me doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

634
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.410
<v Speaker 2>hang on a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

635
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.310
<v Speaker 2>that going to have to give her for </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>

636
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:07.870
<v Speaker 2>the time is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

637
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing it with a few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there doing that.</v>

638
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet there are.</v>

639
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.533
<v Speaker 2>But like this is authentic and true </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign in spite the fact that there's </v>

640
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>like comfortable animation and it's well</v>
<v Speaker 2>put together and it's,</v>

641
00:30:18.911 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

642
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.493
<v Speaker 2>when he showed me in that room that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd do the broadcast in a fire that </v>

643
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 2>he's like a chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:24.304
<v Speaker 2>it's silent.</v>

645
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 2>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sacred.</v>

646
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

647
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.493
<v Speaker 2>and I think like any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any place is not defined by how it </v>

648
00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 2>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:30:34.181 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just like it's a recording studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the feeling kind of in there</v>

650
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

651
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's the same as anything,</v>

652
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.484
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if we,</v>

653
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 2>if we go to work in a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

654
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.713
<v Speaker 2>every space has its own kind of feeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't even have to be into that </v>

655
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.910
<v Speaker 2>sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

656
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 2>that kind of language or vocabulary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>even experienced that.</v>

657
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 2>We got to one place and we experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>one kind of feeling.</v>

658
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:58.600
<v Speaker 2>We go to another places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of fish.</v>

659
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we walk into a room with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

660
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 2>they're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even talk to them,</v>

661
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but we know that they're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a feeling kind of in the room.</v>

662
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 2>So this kind of stuff exists even if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk about it in,</v>

663
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:10.900
<v Speaker 2>in that sort of way.</v>

664
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't necessarily have to go out</v>

665
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 2>there and talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can.</v>

666
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's exciting and it's good </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some people do,</v>

667
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 2>especially within some kind of realms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but specific to meditation,</v>

668
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:25.983
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if each and every one of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes on that responsibility to simply </v>

669
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:30.874
<v Speaker 2>to practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then over time that has an exponential </v>

670
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.023
<v Speaker 2>kind of effect because the feeling is </v>
<v Speaker 2>such that it starts to impact the lives </v>

671
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:41.980
<v Speaker 2>of the people around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

672
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:42.814
<v Speaker 2>I think I spoke to David Lynch once </v>
<v Speaker 2>about meditation and about potentially </v>

673
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 2>having confrontations with people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>air,</v>

674
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:51.890
<v Speaker 2>like going on tv shows and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

675
00:31:51.891 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to advocate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

676
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:54.881
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

677
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no point in doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really just tell them,</v>

678
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>learn to meditate and it will change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will change.</v>

679
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a practice.</v>

680
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 2>It's something that alters your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

681
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've become aware of that.</v>

682
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:06.424
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday again when I was on that TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>set or talking to kids that are like I </v>

683
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:10.144
<v Speaker 2>guess 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his beautiful young men and I'm struck </v>

684
00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 2>by how bright and brilliant and ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>and different they seem,</v>

685
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:18.934
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder if this is some perennial </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality of youth or young people are </v>

686
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>changing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people are ready,</v>

687
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>if there can be some impersonal quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>

688
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

689
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddha kid,</v>

690
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.730
<v Speaker 2>then perhaps there are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meteorological spirits traveling through</v>

691
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's this a change,</v>

692
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:39.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a shift.</v>

693
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

694
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we work a lot with,</v>

696
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and teenagers written,</v>

698
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning meditation and,</v>

699
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.980
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like,</v>

700
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.910
<v Speaker 2>do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you mean by that work a lot with,</v>

701
00:32:50.911 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so going into going into schools,</v>

702
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 2>developing programs for specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so meditation for children,</v>

703
00:32:57.501 --> 00:32:58.334
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in app for them to do with their </v>

704
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.930
<v Speaker 2>parents or we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done,</v>

705
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in schools as well,</v>

706
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.123
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the intention that it becomes part </v>

707
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:11.291
<v Speaker 2>of the school kind of curriculum and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my feeling is that they have watched</v>

708
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 2>and learned from our experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want something different.</v>

709
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

710
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a real kind of readiness and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

711
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:22.694
<v Speaker 2>like a passion about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like as much as people kind </v>

712
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 2>of give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are really kind of tough time.</v>

713
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I actually feel that they're coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

714
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:34.214
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're challenged by all the </v>

715
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 2>distractions of digital and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

716
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 2>but actually feel like they're more </v>
<v Speaker 2>altruistic in nature,</v>

717
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 2>more socially minded than I've seen in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

718
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Certainly our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

719
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.750
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

720
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.340
<v Speaker 2>when you're d does meditation work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

721
00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've mentioned that you're married,</v>

722
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:54.614
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got kids even been through that </v>

723
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:56.684
<v Speaker 2>sort of pre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had quite difficult life and </v>

724
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:00.180
<v Speaker 2>you've lost a lot of people that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved in your life.</v>

725
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more difficult than anyone else's </v>

726
00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but definitely there was some,</v>

727
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.723
<v Speaker 2>there are some key things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened that have influenced my own </v>

728
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it work,</v>

729
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spiritual life,</v>

730
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:09.794
<v Speaker 2>does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it effective when it comes to the </v>

731
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 2>crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the pain comes,</v>

732
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>when the divorce comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people die,</v>

733
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:16.154
<v Speaker 2>when people leave you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you lose control of life and its </v>

734
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you say to people,</v>

735
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 2>this works this way of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

736
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 2>can you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by work?</v>

737
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.673
<v Speaker 2>Does it help with pain and misery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sadness and despair and loneliness and </v>

738
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:35.951
<v Speaker 2>agony and anguish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

739
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.930
<v Speaker 2>my wife's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

740
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite sure why those words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just mean that myself.</v>

741
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.463
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the question that Gareth's </v>

742
00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:47.511
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

743
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:49.580
<v Speaker 2>it's normally Garrett's here doing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things with me.</v>

744
00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so generous as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

745
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:52.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Richie set up,</v>

746
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.413
<v Speaker 2>may I just take the credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my function in life is to take </v>

747
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:57.290
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like one of the questions he sort of</v>

748
00:34:57.291 --> 00:34:58.124
<v Speaker 2>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

749
00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.163
<v Speaker 2>he's seen like that me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my way of dealing with life was I'm </v>

750
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.550
<v Speaker 2>going to take a lot of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna do what's,</v>

751
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do external things.</v>

752
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>material world.</v>

753
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Whereas evidently what you did is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

754
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find another way and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other path.</v>

755
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did.</v>

756
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's so circumstantial.</v>

757
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I look in another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in another town,</v>

758
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 2>in an with another set of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

759
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.103
<v Speaker 2>I just think it was so for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so specific to that time in that </v>

760
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that environment.</v>

761
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

762
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:33.680
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd had meditation in my background,</v>

763
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:34.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'd grown up kind of doing it and </v>

764
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 2>stuff and my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was,</v>

765
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 2>that was in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But definitely to begin with,</v>

766
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 2>my immediate reaction was one to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pub with everyone else,</v>

768
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then kind of,</v>

769
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.143
<v Speaker 2>I probably spent a few years of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and not really seeing a shift in </v>

770
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 2>how I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

771
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:54.324
<v Speaker 2>So I went away and it became a student </v>
<v Speaker 2>and did all the things that students do </v>

772
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:57.144
<v Speaker 2>and it was great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I never felt that I had any kind of </v>

773
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 2>liberation beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense of,</v>

774
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:04.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temporary freedom that I might have had </v>

775
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:06.750
<v Speaker 2>for a few hours on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

776
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 2>on a nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day you wake up.</v>

777
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I never felt that deep sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfillment that I felt was possible</v>

778
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 1>straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:36:14.701 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Fill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went,</v>

780
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 1>you bet at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of reflection ever happening.</v>

781
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine was maybe less extreme.</v>

782
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Just kill that moment of reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got to go.</v>

783
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was,</v>

784
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get angry still?</v>

785
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you get angry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

786
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.900
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you feel angry?</v>

787
00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

788
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to run around kind of ranting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and raving at people.</v>

789
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it manifests like that,</v>

790
00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:44.224
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a three and a half year old son </v>

791
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.180
<v Speaker 2>and an eight month old baby and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep very much in the house.</v>

792
00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:53.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of inevitable at some stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that anger kind of comes up.</v>

793
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.790
<v Speaker 2>And as much as as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

794
00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.020
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to bring the practice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

795
00:36:59.021 --> 00:37:01.210
<v Speaker 2>which is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to witness it and not,</v>

796
00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.640
<v Speaker 2>not to become the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>

797
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.040
<v Speaker 2>to notice the anger is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of present.</v>

798
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

799
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as in I don't see it straight away and </v>

800
00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:13.540
<v Speaker 2>so I'm already kind of on my son go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

801
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.200
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's anger.</v>

802
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you might want to jump off one</v>

803
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:25.180
<v Speaker 1>of those policy and cars and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just remember are the side of the road.</v>

804
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.231
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

805
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's,</v>

806
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what I like thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we came without care,</v>

807
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.470
<v Speaker 1>me and my wife were like the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of nights the baby's jet,</v>

808
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.403
<v Speaker 1>we're jet lagged and I still got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being like four or five </v>

809
00:37:36.071 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 1>o'clock in the morning and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

810
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.620
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can cause this depression?</v>

811
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I think this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No it's no manipulation.</v>

812
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And my wife went and had lunch with jet </v>
<v Speaker 1>lag.</v>

813
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cause me,</v>

814
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:46.444
<v Speaker 1>I think I attached very quickly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and states of mind so that I </v>

815
00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:53.500
<v Speaker 1>need meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be able to go,</v>

816
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.320
<v Speaker 1>oh okay this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not this feeling of anger.</v>

817
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.303
<v Speaker 1>You are not this fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear will pass and you will be </v>

818
00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:01.114
<v Speaker 1>present now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I still feel like even though it's </v>

819
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 1>15 years since I've taken drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

820
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I still feel like I'm subjective fear in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful way.</v>

821
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:10.294
<v Speaker 1>Like I can be hit with fear that demands</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity is like I've gotten to have to </v>

822
00:38:13.211 --> 00:38:15.130
<v Speaker 1>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling this feeling right.</v>

823
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Smashing everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>

824
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>

825
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 1>so it's very hard to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

826
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.440
<v Speaker 1>just breathe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

827
00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying because the meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meditative practice that you have,</v>

828
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:26.590
<v Speaker 1>and of course yours is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

829
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fara version actually is applicable in </v>

830
00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:31.590
<v Speaker 1>situations where the free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

831
00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:33.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're all just kicking off or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

832
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think any meditation</v>

833
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 2>practice which isn't applicable to daily</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

834
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

835
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:40.683
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wonder what's the point a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit because I don't think any of </v>

836
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not applicable in daily life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fucking exactly.</v>

838
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 2>So people sit for 10 minutes and do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditate.</v>

839
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 2>What about the other 23 hours and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes in the day?</v>

840
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like there has to be a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing that.</v>

841
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.153
<v Speaker 2>I just see it as if we can remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves from the madness of our lives </v>

842
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:05.530
<v Speaker 2>for long enough to get familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means to be present,</v>

843
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 2>what it means to be open and curious and</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>

844
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:09.664
<v Speaker 2>compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can start to bring those </v>

845
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 2>qualities back into our everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's an ongoing kind of training.</v>

846
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:15.991
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

847
00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I love that back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's,</v>

849
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually yeah,</v>

850
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 2>that's still kind of happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

851
00:39:22.211 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You go back to meditation and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over time that kind of,</v>

852
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 2>it strengthens where meditation is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer separate from your life.</v>

853
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.853
<v Speaker 2>Meditation is simply a time within your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life or within your day when you pause </v>

854
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.823
<v Speaker 2>and close your eyes.</v>

855
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.403
<v Speaker 1>That's makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing I've been thinking about </v>

856
00:39:37.731 --> 00:39:38.564
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the relationship between the word </v>

857
00:39:39.651 --> 00:39:40.484
<v Speaker 1>whole and the word holy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a sort of becomes an </v>

858
00:39:43.191 --> 00:39:44.024
<v Speaker 1>identifiable wholeness to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that if I'm out on my own and I </v>

859
00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:50.220
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

860
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:53.600
<v Speaker 1>an attractive person pays me attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

861
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.280
<v Speaker 1>oh brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just this guy now.</v>

862
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

863
00:39:55.701 --> 00:39:56.211
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

864
00:39:56.211 --> 00:39:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy that's got the wife and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

865
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.790
<v Speaker 1>You are always that you are a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

866
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't compartmentalize yourself off </v>
<v Speaker 1>into me,</v>

867
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:05.334
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this corner of my life I get away </v>

868
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.990
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the corner of my life where I do</v>

869
00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:10.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what is one thing?</v>

870
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.260
<v Speaker 1>There was one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were completeness.</v>

871
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And you think the meditation creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of connections and foundations</v>

872
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:17.630
<v Speaker 1>and essence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

873
00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:19.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question.</v>

874
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:19.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

875
00:40:19.701 --> 00:40:20.990
<v Speaker 1>we were chatting about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

876
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.330
<v Speaker 1>you met ash just before we came here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

877
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a lovely,</v>

878
00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:27.830
<v Speaker 1>lovely guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

879
00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:32.831
<v Speaker 1>we grew up together and we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>chatting kind of about this idea of um,</v>

880
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.133
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was saying kind of when did you </v>

881
00:40:35.881 --> 00:40:38.130
<v Speaker 2>first kind of really feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:38.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

883
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still remember kind of being in,</v>

884
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:48.020
<v Speaker 2>in the monastery and something kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just melting away where I no longer felt</v>

885
00:40:48.691 --> 00:40:51.630
<v Speaker 2>that extreme sense of self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense.</v>

886
00:40:51.631 --> 00:40:53.920
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not suggesting for a moment that,</v>

887
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment or anything like this,</v>

888
00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:56.634
<v Speaker 2>but just a glimpse perhaps of of what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant not to feel kind of isolated or </v>

889
00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:05.760
<v Speaker 2>separate from the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that,</v>

890
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.373
<v Speaker 2>in that moment there wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a person to be separate </v>

891
00:41:10.921 --> 00:41:11.754
<v Speaker 2>from every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was only hole and there wasn't </v>

892
00:41:12.811 --> 00:41:16.040
<v Speaker 2>even any one there to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience and to think about it.</v>

893
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:16.874
<v Speaker 2>Is this the whole or is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's simply that was all that </v>

894
00:41:19.981 --> 00:41:20.900
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

895
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.701
<v Speaker 2>wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

896
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:22.534
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that was a low is it's just </v>

897
00:41:27.091 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 2>an experience in those come and go.</v>

898
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.333
<v Speaker 2>And it all depends on how stable those </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences are and how much can they </v>

899
00:41:31.831 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 2>become a part of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it was quite temporary,</v>

900
00:41:34.281 --> 00:41:35.114
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something kind of in that </v>

901
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:42.320
<v Speaker 2>which really spoke to a different way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewing the world.</v>

902
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 2>You see Buddha and Jesus and that kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

903
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 2>that 17 year old God man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you met them catch.</v>

904
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're living there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that there's in that state all</v>

905
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be,</v>

906
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

907
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.401
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

908
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one other fight if I,</v>

909
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.543
<v Speaker 2>if I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was another monastery that I went </v>

910
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:00.411
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to visit.</v>

911
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:01.244
<v Speaker 2>So there are this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this a monastery for a second </v>

912
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.030
<v Speaker 2>pretty much monastery and monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

913
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.873
<v Speaker 2>want to transcend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had enough transcendent to get </v>

914
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:12.680
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to your wife,</v>

915
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 2>monastery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf.</v>

916
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.643
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

917
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

918
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of an elite troop of kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of meditators,</v>

919
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

920
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:22.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within this tradition they get picked </v>

921
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:27.420
<v Speaker 2>out the cad you school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so there were four main ones in Tibet.</v>

923
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Cadre was one of the four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that alarm or he's a good look.</v>

924
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

925
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.863
<v Speaker 2>he's very well known obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his just transcendent wisdom and </v>

926
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's also,</v>

927
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:43.070
<v Speaker 2>he was also the head of government for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and sort of,</v>

928
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 2>although he's not the head of all four </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>

929
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:46.124
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably better known in the West </v>

930
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 2>than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this monastery,</v>

931
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

932
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.173
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull the kids out pretty young and </v>

933
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 2>obviously the kids have to want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

934
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 2>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have to show a real kind of,</v>

935
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the word?</v>

936
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.363
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of potential in meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The families have to be on board as </v>

937
00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:05.504
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're picked out and from about </v>

938
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 2>the age of 10 or 11 they're in strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>retreat.</v>

939
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 2>They never go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never see anyone speak to anyone or</v>

940
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:14.774
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were invited to this monastery </v>

941
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.713
<v Speaker 2>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare to meet anyone from that </v>

942
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy who ran it was,</v>

943
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 2>he lived above the monastery and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this chap,</v>

944
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think because I was with this chap</v>

945
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.213
<v Speaker 2>donal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were invited to go and see him and </v>

946
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.900
<v Speaker 2>going into that room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in there,</v>

947
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 2>there were four of us that went in </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

948
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.513
<v Speaker 2>that that is someone I would say who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely living that sense of </v>

949
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:42.974
<v Speaker 2>wholeness in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe there was an ounce of </v>

950
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 2>separation kind of left in him.</v>

951
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 2>He was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't there.</v>

952
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.193
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing but a presence of </v>

953
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>

954
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:56.960
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>

955
00:43:56.961 --> 00:43:57.794
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to kind of call it or </v>

956
00:43:58.371 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 2>define it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

957
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 2>there was someone there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was nobody there.</v>

958
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like he was,</v>

959
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>he had completely transcended itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that that was his existence.</v>

960
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:14.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like the realization that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>biographical identity and your primer,</v>

961
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of primal motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your last a jealousy,</v>

962
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 2>fear or even personal love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our temporal interpretations.</v>

963
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And if your identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreter,</v>

964
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.210
<v Speaker 2>the witness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience becomes your base,</v>

965
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>your essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there is freedom</v>

966
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.500
<v Speaker 1>because curiously it's a colloquialism </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

967
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:35.334
<v Speaker 1>After I met that Geezer adding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swami and I went to my mate Matt </v>

968
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Huskies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

969
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it goes,</v>

970
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:41.934
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine there's anything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say to him that would knock him </v>

971
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:45.410
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said like,</v>

972
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

973
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>and my mate went like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

974
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 1>what if you went might as some skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking up your car.</v>

975
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.833
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't like there's nothing you </v>

976
00:44:52.291 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 1>could say or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be in our band?</v>

977
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't go all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

978
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

979
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing to get,</v>

980
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

981
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

982
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is though with Amma,</v>

983
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:07.854
<v Speaker 1>the hugging saint who I also feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>she emanates great wisdom and I'd have </v>

984
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:13.770
<v Speaker 1>followers think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

985
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 1>they're very in like that Hindu as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know better than me.</v>

986
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Like they're much more idolatry based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying this woman is an </v>

987
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 1>incarnation of carly or some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

988
00:45:22.821 --> 00:45:23.654
<v Speaker 1>they say she's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah now like I was watching her and </v>

989
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 1>she's amazing and powerful and visibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into China,</v>

990
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 1>send an states and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this big night,</v>

991
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:35.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was New Year's eve and I have 10,000</v>

992
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.500
<v Speaker 1>followers hanging out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

993
00:45:38.501 --> 00:45:43.240
<v Speaker 1>sort of his big party and chanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cool and she's up,</v>

994
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthroned and stuff.</v>

995
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.773
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit where someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a musician like messed up something and </v>

996
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I've actually just been always sought </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

997
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.144
<v Speaker 1>finger out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in whatever southern Indian </v>

998
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:53.574
<v Speaker 1>language she speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went and sought sorta thing out of </v>

999
00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.173
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's still interacting with the </v>

1000
00:45:57.871 --> 00:46:00.650
<v Speaker 1>material world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why one though.</v>

1001
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And they sort of say in Christianity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ says like,</v>

1002
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

1003
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but not of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.360
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you feel about perennialism?</v>

1005
00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:12.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you feel about identifiable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1006
00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Speaker 1>truths that are appear in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not all spiritual traditions.</v>

1007
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I also,</v>

1008
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.780
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the more that we,</v>

1009
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.660
<v Speaker 2>the more that we rely on words and </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts,</v>

1010
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:31.300
<v Speaker 2>the further we move away from truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1011
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.530
<v Speaker 2>the challenge always I think with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>great teachers is that there's always an</v>

1012
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:36.940
<v Speaker 2>essence there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

1013
00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often talked about is sort of </v>

1014
00:46:39.911 --> 00:46:40.744
<v Speaker 2>mystical schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think there's an essence and </v>

1015
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:46.150
<v Speaker 2>the essence is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is awareness and compassion for what,</v>

1016
00:46:46.151 --> 00:46:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't find other other words but that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called by many names,</v>

1017
00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.340
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

1018
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.293
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called at call it that I feel like </v>

1019
00:46:54.041 --> 00:46:56.980
<v Speaker 2>that's at the heart of every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every lineage,</v>

1020
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.720
<v Speaker 2>every tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every faith,</v>

1021
00:46:58.721 --> 00:47:03.721
<v Speaker 2>every tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just feel that the further it kind</v>

1022
00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:07.030
<v Speaker 2>of moves outwards and as it moves out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into society,</v>

1023
00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the less and less it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence.</v>

1024
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And the more and more it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a structure,</v>

1025
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.860
<v Speaker 2>often a structure reliant on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:47:15.861 --> 00:47:16.694
<v Speaker 2>the power and government and all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other kind of factors that start to </v>

1027
00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:20.044
<v Speaker 2>play into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden like the essence is </v>

1028
00:47:21.701 --> 00:47:24.220
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people are doing things and going</v>

1029
00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:25.054
<v Speaker 2>through the motions of things and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even really kind of necessarily knowing </v>

1030
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:29.523
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing or why they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>or even having the benefit of </v>

1031
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 2>experiencing the essence of that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

1032
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:35.914
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let us obviously kind of very </v>

1033
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 2>general and broad and it's not true in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every case,</v>

1034
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it a lot.</v>

1035
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've,</v>

1036
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw in Asian countries as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll often,</v>

1037
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:46.294
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 2>in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like this in the east at,</v>

1039
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I saw that in just as much in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian countries as I did in,</v>

1040
00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>in the west.</v>

1041
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And even in your monastic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

1042
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gap at this time,</v>

1043
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we discussed it before,</v>

1044
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 2>it was more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1045
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 2>let's eliminate as much as possible all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ephemera of everyday affairs.</v>

1046
00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 2>So you can focus on awareness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>

1047
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Cultivate in these qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:10.883
<v Speaker 2>But that itself is a form of structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is in evidence that we go from </v>

1049
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of Christ,</v>

1050
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:19.204
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 2>abandoned your possessions and follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1052
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Don't get caught up in material world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves everything.</v>

1053
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't judge nobody to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to need cathedrals.</v>

1054
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a sort of,</v>

1055
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 2>it becomes materialized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized.</v>

1056
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:33.610
<v Speaker 2>And that is not about this essence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1057
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I,</v>

1058
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what really moved me and look is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1059
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely the same in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all mystical schools,</v>

1060
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Christianity or Sufism of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>

1061
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Like you can find it in many in all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great traditions.</v>

1062
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.390
<v Speaker 2>But what really inspired me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1063
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great yogis of Tibet,</v>

1064
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:52.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1065
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 2>they issued all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want anything to do with any</v>

1066
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even the monasteries.</v>

1067
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.300
<v Speaker 2>They would just go to a cave in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains and they break it up and,</v>

1068
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.313
<v Speaker 2>and they'd have a little hole in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner where they pass their waste out </v>

1069
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:05.464
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd have a little hole in the other </v>

1070
00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:06.694
<v Speaker 2>corner where someone would come along </v>
<v Speaker 2>every now and again and put some food </v>

1071
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:11.620
<v Speaker 2>inside and they would live their lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it was,</v>

1072
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 2>it was free from all that kind of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1073
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 2>And whilst on the one hand it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not very kind of practical.</v>

1074
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.123
<v Speaker 2>I think on the other hand it created an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where the focus and the </v>

1075
00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:25.414
<v Speaker 2>intention was on the essence and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivation of the essence and the </v>

1076
00:49:28.391 --> 00:49:29.224
<v Speaker 2>continuance of the essence through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ages rather than trying to create these </v>

1077
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:33.604
<v Speaker 2>greatest establishments that maybe kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of didn't necessarily kind of have to </v>

1078
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:40.060
<v Speaker 2>focus and intention on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the essence,</v>

1079
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:40.933
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their social structures and social </v>

1080
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:46.630
<v Speaker 2>structures tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnetism seems to be towards power.</v>

1081
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.693
<v Speaker 2>We talked before about polarity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts such as positive and negative </v>

1082
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 2>and even these you issue the evening </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1083
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>well I think from a meditation point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view they're,</v>

1084
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.713
<v Speaker 2>they're really challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of us will have a relationship </v>

1085
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:01.504
<v Speaker 2>with the mind where we kind of all with </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts where we see some thoughts as </v>

1086
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:06.400
<v Speaker 2>positive and we see some thoughts as </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

1087
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:07.743
<v Speaker 2>So in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already created a framework for </v>

1088
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:10.834
<v Speaker 2>tension and stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know of positive thoughts come </v>

1089
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to hold onto them or you want to</v>

1090
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 2>chase after them and if they look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going away,</v>

1091
00:50:17.561 --> 00:50:18.394
<v Speaker 2>we get a little bit kind of nervous or </v>
<v Speaker 2>we desire them so much that we chase </v>

1092
00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:23.080
<v Speaker 2>after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're caught up in that.</v>

1093
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 2>If a negative thought comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't like it,</v>

1094
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>we maybe we experience fear or were very</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant to it.</v>

1095
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 2>So we then kind of pushing against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

1096
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But when we then you'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you know this from your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation or when you,</v>

1098
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 2>when you step back just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 2>a thought is a thought and if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with it,</v>

1100
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.340
<v Speaker 2>if we're able to kind of maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1101
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 2>that seat of awareness where we simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>witness a thought coming and going,</v>

1102
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's neither good nor bad.</v>

1103
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.063
<v Speaker 2>It only becomes good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we start to think about it in a </v>

1104
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:53.054
<v Speaker 2>certain way and once we start to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with it and to engage with </v>

1105
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 2>it and to create a storyline around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes problematic.</v>

1106
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 2>But I thought in and of itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>neither is neither positive or negative</v>

1107
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 1>in a way for is the first layer of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material world.</v>

1108
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.841
<v Speaker 2>I I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1110
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's always different ways of,</v>

1111
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 2>of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like that's the first,</v>

1112
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1113
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.983
<v Speaker 2>normally the first place where we kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of get a bit caught up and where we </v>

1114
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:27.590
<v Speaker 2>start to experience suffering and stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our life.</v>

1115
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Because even though like I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditating in seven years,</v>

1116
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:34.600
<v Speaker 1>transcendental meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I been listening to headspace and like,</v>

1117
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to the beginners bit,</v>

1118
00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's free.</v>

1119
00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I thought I Weiss of so odds but credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>card number into something like,</v>

1120
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1121
00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.630
<v Speaker 1>this feels like a real commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1122
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but like so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1123
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but even though like when I'm listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then 10 minute ones,</v>

1124
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:47.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody hell,</v>

1125
00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:49.830
<v Speaker 1>this is for proper beginners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lard,</v>

1126
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.673
<v Speaker 1>recommend to mates and mine are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights did in driveways and that guy </v>

1127
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:54.281
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this,</v>

1128
00:51:54.281 --> 00:51:55.840
<v Speaker 1>this will be of your meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But me,</v>

1129
00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been meditating all this time and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>still like,</v>

1130
00:51:58.361 --> 00:52:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably maybe wandered off now just</v>

1131
00:52:01.031 --> 00:52:01.864
<v Speaker 1>returned back to the awareness of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rising and falling Nebraska and bloody </v>

1132
00:52:03.761 --> 00:52:04.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am just saying yeah.</v>

1133
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Thinking again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of like,</v>

1135
00:52:08.051 --> 00:52:11.770
<v Speaker 1>it's being stylish in this habit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1136
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible,</v>

1137
00:52:13.271 --> 00:52:18.271
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so ingrained and there's does this,</v>

1138
00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:21.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes this idea that,</v>

1139
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends will say,</v>

1140
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people who meditate was how yeah,</v>

1141
00:52:24.171 --> 00:52:26.230
<v Speaker 2>you went away and he did it for kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>so low,</v>

1142
00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:27.460
<v Speaker 2>so low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll kind of,</v>

1143
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.433
<v Speaker 2>so what in a way it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that I no longer </v>

1144
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.640
<v Speaker 2>experience distraction of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

1145
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:34.493
<v Speaker 2>it is a practice and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that none of us really </v>

1146
00:52:38.411 --> 00:52:40.800
<v Speaker 2>kind of mastered is that maybe the odd </v>
<v Speaker 2>few people like you know,</v>

1147
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.330
<v Speaker 2>people we've been chatting about today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it is a,</v>

1148
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:44.183
<v Speaker 2>is a lifelong practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said journey for life and we're all </v>

1149
00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:47.854
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are always a student and if we ever </v>

1150
00:52:49.511 --> 00:52:50.344
<v Speaker 2>lose that sense of not being a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we've lost that sense of freshness </v>

1151
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:57.310
<v Speaker 2>and curiosity and openness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginner's mind,</v>

1152
00:52:57.311 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 2>which I feel is so important in </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>

1153
00:53:00.131 --> 00:53:02.470
<v Speaker 2>If we're not turning up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just a routine.</v>

1154
00:53:02.471 --> 00:53:03.910
<v Speaker 2>We just kind of going through the motion</v>

1155
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 1>assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about little kids be in,</v>

1156
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken off right there.</v>

1157
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 11 years old.</v>

1158
00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:09.944
<v Speaker 1>It just seems extraordinary as a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's grown up in the culture at I have </v>

1159
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would even be an option.</v>

1160
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:15.111
<v Speaker 1>But I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1161
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:15.944
<v Speaker 1>you think about it with football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd take off a six year old trough in </v>

1162
00:53:18.031 --> 00:53:18.864
<v Speaker 1>some football academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you would an 11 year </v>

1163
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:21.974
<v Speaker 1>old would be capable of that and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you how much cultural experiences </v>

1164
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 1>in the world knowable to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think candy,</v>

1165
00:53:27.361 --> 00:53:28.194
<v Speaker 1>that fear and desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constant triggers to action are so </v>

1166
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:33.684
<v Speaker 1>prevalent culturally that the news is </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting fear that commerce if rounds </v>

1167
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.203
<v Speaker 1>on desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these animalistic states a </v>

1168
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.960
<v Speaker 1>perpetuated that we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1169
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.580
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1170
00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 1>an alternative if not oppositional force</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideology because the Po,</v>

1171
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1172
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 1>the magnetism is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The magnetism,</v>

1173
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess it depends how we,</v>

1175
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.670
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different viewpoints on it,</v>

1176
00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:04.360
<v Speaker 2>but how we approached that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's one idea,</v>

1177
00:54:04.361 --> 00:54:07.810
<v Speaker 2>do we try and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we try?</v>

1178
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I think very often you'll see one idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1179
00:54:09.941 --> 00:54:12.040
<v Speaker 2>she's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in American politics right now,</v>

1180
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.113
<v Speaker 2>there's one idea presented and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side they just shout a little bit </v>

1181
00:54:15.851 --> 00:54:18.190
<v Speaker 2>kind of louder and then this side shouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>louder.</v>

1182
00:54:18.191 --> 00:54:20.410
<v Speaker 2>And then this side til eventually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1183
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1184
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.850
<v Speaker 2>there's so much kind of conflict and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess there's a,</v>

1185
00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>there are different ways of coming at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1186
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 2>and arguably the way of creating that </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative kind of route is rather than</v>

1187
00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 2>by trying to overthrow that in a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1188
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.573
<v Speaker 2>a physical or energetic kind of way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more kind of not engaging paps and </v>

1189
00:54:42.551 --> 00:54:45.400
<v Speaker 2>creating an environment where that can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist now.</v>

1190
00:54:45.401 --> 00:54:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Because if all of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are living an open,</v>

1191
00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.400
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate kind of life,</v>

1192
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:53.920
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to vote for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1193
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1194
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:56.290
<v Speaker 2>we enable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1195
00:54:56.291 --> 00:54:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the society enables that </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1196
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily,</v>

1197
00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:05.890
<v Speaker 2>we're not necessarily slaves to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all kind of part of that and each and</v>

1198
00:55:05.891 --> 00:55:09.130
<v Speaker 2>every one of us has a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1199
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:09.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1200
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.310
<v Speaker 2>to be more present perhaps and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in it.</v>

1201
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.303
<v Speaker 1>I think that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that I did from various </v>

1202
00:55:16.701 --> 00:55:19.480
<v Speaker 1>different sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even quite,</v>

1203
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchists and quite political people,</v>

1204
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are sort of progressive,</v>

1205
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:25.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] ideas of setting up </v>

1206
00:55:28.011 --> 00:55:28.844
<v Speaker 1>societies that are independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that don't engage in opposition </v>

1207
00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Ism simply establish alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>established alternatives and living it.</v>

1208
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.603
<v Speaker 1>And when I think about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two boys that was talking to yesterday </v>

1209
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 1>were young men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:42.163
<v Speaker 1>Like I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not going to want to like if </v>

1211
00:55:43.491 --> 00:55:45.860
<v Speaker 1>you give them that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is a system.</v>

1212
00:55:45.861 --> 00:55:46.694
<v Speaker 1>He was an alternative system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way we can live in the world </v>

1213
00:55:48.981 --> 00:55:52.700
<v Speaker 1>and we admit that the NAC is a woven </v>
<v Speaker 1>material in it with consuming in it.</v>

1214
00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:54.760
<v Speaker 1>We've where we acumen and we're frail </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we we're flawed.</v>

1215
00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1216
00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:58.610
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to live in the extremist </v>
<v Speaker 1>state that are currently being offered.</v>

1217
00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Even see that inside our own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1218
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.043
<v Speaker 2>That we almost fanned the flames when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide a lot of opposition or a lot of </v>

1219
00:56:05.621 --> 00:56:08.320
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't,</v>

1220
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.840
<v Speaker 2>it keeps the thing alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He know.</v>

1221
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So I worry sometimes that if the more we</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of push in one direction,</v>

1222
00:56:15.131 --> 00:56:20.131
<v Speaker 2>actually the more sort of tension we </v>
<v Speaker 2>create kind of coming back towards us.</v>

1223
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit like I Quito or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1224
00:56:22.781 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

1225
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.310
<v Speaker 2>if the force is coming towards you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than push against it,</v>

1226
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 2>just move to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it go past,</v>

1227
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:28.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something interesting in that </v>

1228
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 2>kind of movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:32.134
<v Speaker 2>It feels like we plug into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about bumper cars quite often </v>

1230
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.033
<v Speaker 2>that they know that we're these vehicles</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have an area when it goes into the </v>

1231
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:42.120
<v Speaker 2>grid of negativity and anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we just sort of unplug from that,</v>

1232
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.670
<v Speaker 2>then you're not being sourced by in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

1233
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And I do think we can live in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but choose not to be a part of that kind</v>

1234
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:51.020
<v Speaker 2>of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1235
00:56:51.021 --> 00:56:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Can I run for some of these questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Garath Dan just selling,</v>

1236
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 2>make sure that everything's covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1237
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 2>are you still in touch with teachers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tibet,</v>

1238
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 2>like your guru in that and who is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>guru and you still study with him?</v>

1239
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much still in touch with them.</v>

1240
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:05.951
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:08.870
<v Speaker 2>we were chatting just beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you a picture of our,</v>

1242
00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it was really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

1243
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

1244
00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:14.040
<v Speaker 2>the abbots from the Tibetan monasteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1245
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>my old retreat master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came out and visited everybody's name</v>

1246
00:57:17.081 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's La Llama.</v>

1247
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She ran pushy.</v>

1248
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:20.573
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1249
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.443
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is normally always impressed when </v>

1250
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I see them on a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite,</v>

1251
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.590
<v Speaker 2>quite high up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

1252
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.410
<v Speaker 2>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done their,</v>

1253
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.830
<v Speaker 2>they've done their time and lane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1254
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 2>he's not applying.</v>

1255
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was amazing.</v>

1256
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so mad at you or they love you,</v>

1257
00:57:36.701 --> 00:57:39.660
<v Speaker 2>they're happy or they seem really happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

1258
00:57:39.661 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I was genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1259
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:45.661
<v Speaker 2>that's probably one of the most magical </v>
<v Speaker 2>special times for me personally,</v>

1260
00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 2>kind of in the whole headspace journey </v>
<v Speaker 2>is having him come out here.</v>

1261
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:50.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spent a day with the whole team kind </v>

1262
00:57:52.151 --> 00:57:52.660
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1264
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.920

<v Speaker 2>of approval,</v>

1265
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:02.020
<v Speaker 2>but him coming out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of felt like,</v>

1266
00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:02.854
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was really kind of meaningful </v>

1267
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 2>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1268
00:58:07.481 --> 00:58:08.314
<v Speaker 2>there is always the concern when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to present something that has </v>

1269
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:12.454
<v Speaker 2>been so carefully kind of looked after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of traveled so many </v>

1270
00:58:16.361 --> 00:58:17.910
<v Speaker 2>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.410
<v Speaker 2>of of messing with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1272
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I really calm,</v>

1273
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 2>really care about.</v>

1274
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the thing I care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>

1275
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And so him coming out here and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this is,</v>

1276
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 2>this is really kind of good for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1277
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 2>That meant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1278
00:58:30.701 --> 00:58:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I meant a huge amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful isn't it?</v>

1279
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Because that's one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges is how do we transfer it?</v>

1280
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have,</v>

1281
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 2>can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did it as if you were carrying a</v>

1282
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:44.971
<v Speaker 2>baby bird got to carry this thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go in the wall.</v>

1283
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.271
<v Speaker 2>Precious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1284
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:49.270
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's really easy to lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1285
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 2>two and a half thousand years of r and d</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1286
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:53.223
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>R and D is sort of research development </v>

1287
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.773
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.693
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it'd be so easy to lose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficacy in all the time and attention </v>

1289
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:05.410
<v Speaker 2>and precision that's gone into that over</v>
<v Speaker 2>countless lifetimes.</v>

1290
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.870
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't want to be the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that messes that up,</v>

1291
00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with this thing.</v>

1292
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reiterate.</v>

1293
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Then Andy there I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that like,</v>

1294
00:59:15.941 --> 00:59:17.150
<v Speaker 2>what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1295
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:18.123
<v Speaker 2>what is the teaching of Buddha?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite big question to come up </v>

1296
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you just sum that up,</v>

1297
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 2>please end it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like him but like,</v>

1298
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.143
<v Speaker 2>cause this is is it's Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This headspace I genuine even as a </v>

1299
00:59:31.131 --> 00:59:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist monk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't um,</v>

1300
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.310
<v Speaker 2>self identify as Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1301
00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 2>and deluded may monitoring wrapped in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blanket.</v>

1302
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:39.913
<v Speaker 2>What did he think he was a hell's angel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably that's what you're going to be </v>

1303
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:42.464
<v Speaker 2>off to the circus.</v>

1304
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't call it as not helpful.</v>

1305
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I just think that the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of,</v>

1306
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:53.580
<v Speaker 2>of meditation is letting go of labels </v>
<v Speaker 2>and identity.</v>

1307
00:59:53.581 --> 00:59:57.520
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of ironic we then kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on and adopt the label of,</v>

1308
00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:00.440
<v Speaker 2>of being a Buddhist or a Hindu or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it kind of might be.</v>

1309
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 2>So I personally didn't find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly helpful way of thinking.</v>

1310
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1311
01:00:06.521 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally,</v>

1312
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 2>obviously I practiced those teachings </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>

1313
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.553
<v Speaker 2>They're very much kind of a part of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and they absolutely a hundred </v>

1314
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.230
<v Speaker 2>percent influence kind of the content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1315
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 2>and a responsible for the content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it's in the APP,</v>

1316
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it as Buddhist.</v>

1317
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked just now about the essence,</v>

1318
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the essence that is alive in every great</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition and every great culture.</v>

1319
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it is the delivery of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence.</v>

1320
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's that as the chocolate without </v>

1321
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the wrapper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1322
01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that if Jesus,</v>

1323
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed and Buddha met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will not have a fight,</v>

1324
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.460
<v Speaker 2>but they ain't go no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1325
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.570
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine.</v>

1326
01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I quite like just be at that dinner </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1327
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.620
<v Speaker 2>What they talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1328
01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1329
01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1330
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.070
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1331
01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:57.943
<v Speaker 2>ultimately you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the label people get hung up on the </v>

1332
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>labels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get hung up on the denominations.</v>

1333
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>But I suppose like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.253
<v Speaker 2>coming from a Hindu tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transformation of Buddhism was what </v>

1335
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>exactly fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still a big question,</v>

1336
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:14.481
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

1337
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:18.020
<v Speaker 2>what was it like suffering and desire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch out for that crap.</v>

1338
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think dude,</v>

1339
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recognizing that,</v>

1340
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm trying to work out is that </v>

1341
01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>what happened to that man under that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree?</v>

1342
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relevant to me now it feels like it is.</v>

1343
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Cause I again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I think these things are,</v>

1344
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.430
<v Speaker 2>they're timeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

1345
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 2>they're universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really interesting,</v>

1346
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:39.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about kind of </v>

1347
01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.560
<v Speaker 2>attraction to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1348
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>to the flesh and all those kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to even if you read those stories,</v>

1349
01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.573
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like he was there and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was experiencing this perfect mind and </v>

1350
01:01:48.411 --> 01:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no thoughts of desire or lost</v>

1351
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 2>or greed or desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that stuff was there.</v>

1352
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.990
<v Speaker 2>He was tempted was neen all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms and figures.</v>

1353
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was picturing kind of beautiful naked</v>

1354
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't feel like that's really such</v>

1355
01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:06.140
<v Speaker 2>a kind of great leap away from where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and have been most of us in,</v>

1356
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:06.974
<v Speaker 2>in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just there was such a kind of a </v>

1357
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:13.991
<v Speaker 2>commitment to an intention to see those </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what they were,</v>

1358
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply as thoughts and not real.</v>

1359
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:19.840
<v Speaker 2>And not permanent and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>

1360
01:02:19.841 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>in</v>

1361
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>having that relationship and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective with his mind,</v>

1362
01:02:23.311 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>with his thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1363
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.840
<v Speaker 1>there was a release and therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1364
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>a permanent at some stager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete freedom from the,</v>

1365
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:33.063
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of kind of our thinking </v>

1366
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1367
01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Is there some beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful stories I felt,</v>

1368
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1369
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.353
<v Speaker 1>like I said to you mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I left my wife and a daughter not </v>

1370
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:45.954
<v Speaker 1>permanently banned in the family just </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a minute while I did this at Abbot </v>

1371
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Kinney and wander around there on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>short walk,</v>

1372
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the thought occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am already dead.</v>

1373
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>You are already dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that happens to you,</v>

1374
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>it's meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those are thought you get get often.</v>

1375
01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

1376
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>but it gets off the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get versions of like,</v>

1377
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it exists to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1378
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>to mitigate the for that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to acquire,</v>

1379
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.023
<v Speaker 1>to attain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much a person that's I'm </v>

1380
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixated.</v>

1381
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I must do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must get that,</v>

1382
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:22.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause even when you sort of like that </v>

1383
01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:24.414
<v Speaker 1>when people do at in enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I took psychedelics when I was </v>

1384
01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recognize it cause I've shortcutted it</v>

1385
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you get that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self immolation and the idea of like,</v>

1386
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not real.</v>

1387
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I remember like I was 16 year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took acid.</v>

1388
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>We've just like lads from now as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out like the Yorkshire,</v>

1389
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>like tripping and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember,</v>

1390
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a person.</v>

1391
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.324
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know like I remember realizing it and </v>

1392
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>feeling it and like it's terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are,</v>

1393
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any tradition.</v>

1394
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.830
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to tell you that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going all right,</v>

1395
01:03:58.831 --> 01:03:59.664
<v Speaker 1>this is just this temporary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be here for a brief </v>

1396
01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:02.300
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1397
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1398
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:04.044
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts occur to me and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always occurred to me and I've always </v>

1399
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:07.194
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1400
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.123
<v Speaker 1>I've found something in me that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>make me think that past life or some </v>

1401
01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:12.054
<v Speaker 1>version of that or interconnected </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in some form maybe a deal </v>

1402
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>because it like often thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem familiar.</v>

1403
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Often things seem attractive to me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that are,</v>

1404
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you spoke of your own instinct,</v>

1405
01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.573
<v Speaker 1>your own intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decided at some point I'm mafia to </v>

1406
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>go to the Himalayas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1407
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:28.921
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1408
01:04:28.921 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go and study with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1409
01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 1>who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>

1410
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:33.384
<v Speaker 1>That speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is me and like Adam Curtis on the </v>

1411
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.713
<v Speaker 1>early guests on this podcast goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem of our time now is there's </v>

1412
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>someone in our air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1413
01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:41.034
<v Speaker 1>the pink floyd lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone in my head and it's not </v>

1414
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:43.014
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone talking inside your own </v>

1415
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>mind and that's not who you are.</v>

1416
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy that.</v>

1417
01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to perhaps that you know,</v>

1418
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>you've become identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodified condition,</v>

1419
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:54.714
<v Speaker 1>the trained to behave in a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are now completely detached from this </v>

1420
01:04:57.331 --> 01:04:58.164
<v Speaker 1>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this essence that you talk about this </v>

1421
01:04:58.861 --> 01:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>awareness and compassion who have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with it anymore.</v>

1422
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't know that it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1423
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:06.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the interesting thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

1424
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and I agreed that the risk is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's,</v>

1425
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 1>that it's elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think it's not there or not here,</v>

1426
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>then we might start to think</v>

1427
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>that it exists elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1428
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:21.243
<v Speaker 2>and I would contend that actually it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and he is with each and every one </v>

1429
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>of us all of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never anywhere else.</v>

1430
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:29.254
<v Speaker 2>It's just that maybe we don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of connection with it or we don't </v>

1431
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:35.300
<v Speaker 2>have a familiarity with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel that's the struggle.</v>

1432
01:05:35.301 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people come to meditation </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than kind of allowing sort of the</v>

1433
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>clouds the past to experience the blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>

1434
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>There's more of a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1435
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:44.680
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to experience blue sky.</v>

1436
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>How do I push all those clouds out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way and how do I kind of create this</v>

1437
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:48.514
<v Speaker 2>space?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what I think meditation is rather </v>

1438
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 2>than just allowing a natural process to </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfold.</v>

1439
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.480
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite,</v>

1440
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:56.314
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on in the world and </v>

1441
01:05:58.601 --> 01:05:59.434
<v Speaker 2>whatever people are doing and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for all of us or this is </v>

1442
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 2>something I find really kind of useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1443
01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.613
<v Speaker 2>is knowing that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness and compassion is still there </v>

1444
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:09.543
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the circumstances that conditioning the </v>

1445
01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 2>environment as not necessarily allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to shine through.</v>

1446
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.920
<v Speaker 2>But it is there and it's there in each </v>
<v Speaker 2>and every one of us.</v>

1447
01:06:17.921 --> 01:06:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I really sort of profoundly kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>

1448
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>believe that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly.</v>

1449
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Willie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we conclude with some meditation?</v>

1450
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 2>There are other questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1451
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.600
<v Speaker 2>they're not as interesting as the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ass though.</v>

1452
01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Great questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gaff,</v>

1453
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 2>tape be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've got like a like should we,</v>

1454
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.700
<v Speaker 2>can we conclude the call meditation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do a bit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1462
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me decide.</v>

1463
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Coke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1464
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1465
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.150
<v Speaker 2>have ever been done in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1466
01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Won't help us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1467
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.050
<v Speaker 2>So know whether it's just us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of is.</v>

1468
01:07:03.051 --> 01:07:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who wants to kind of join him </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

1469
01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.650
<v Speaker 2>when they're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1470
01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:08.840
<v Speaker 2>just um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>general bit of advice.</v>

1471
01:07:08.841 --> 01:07:09.674
<v Speaker 2>Just make sure that you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable and you're not going to be </v>

1472
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:13.550
<v Speaker 2>disturbed for just a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of minutes.</v>

1473
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if there's a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise going on in the background,</v>

1474
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.180
<v Speaker 2>but just taking a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always when you first sit down,</v>

1475
01:07:20.181 --> 01:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to ground the body,</v>

1476
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:23.563
<v Speaker 2>so just feel the weight of the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the chair or the floor beneath </v>

1477
01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:27.884
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soles of the feet on the floor and the </v>

1478
01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:32.174
<v Speaker 2>weight of the hands and the arms just </v>
<v Speaker 2>resting on the legs and you can start </v>

1479
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>off with your eyes open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes closed,</v>

1480
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>whatever feels kind of more comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have your eyes open,</v>

1481
01:07:42.951 --> 01:07:43.784
<v Speaker 2>just drive your camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than to focus on one particular </v>

1482
01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:49.250
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have a nice kind of spacious,</v>

1483
01:07:49.251 --> 01:07:50.084
<v Speaker 2>relaxed focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of just takes in the entire </v>

1484
01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of space around you so you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really see any one thing in focus.</v>

1485
01:07:56.301 --> 01:08:01.301
<v Speaker 2>You just see everything around you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just maintaining that soft focus.</v>

1486
01:08:02.331 --> 01:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Just tell you a couple of big deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaths.</v>

1487
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Breathing in through the nose and out </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the mouth.</v>

1488
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Just one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breathing in through the nose,</v>

1489
01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.673
<v Speaker 2>announce for the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you breathe out this time just </v>

1490
01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:26.621
<v Speaker 2>gently closing the eyes and just feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weight again,</v>

1491
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.160
<v Speaker 2>pressing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow any thoughts to just come and go.</v>

1492
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>The mine's going to continue to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to stop any thoughts,</v>

1493
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.210
<v Speaker 2>just bringing the attention into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1494
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.273
<v Speaker 2>I'm just noticing how the body feels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a sense of heaviness or </v>

1495
01:08:48.701 --> 01:08:49.534
<v Speaker 2>lightness in the body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel like there's a sense of </v>

1496
01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>stillness or restlessness in the body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not trying to change anything.</v>

1497
01:09:10.891 --> 01:09:15.891
<v Speaker 2>Just noticing the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sensation and as you sit there,</v>

1498
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>just starting to notice how the body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>

1499
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.473
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not trying to breathe in any </v>

1500
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 2>special way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the breath will be quick.</v>

1501
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's deep,</v>

1502
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let it do its own thing.</v>

1503
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.053
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1504
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.840
<v Speaker 2>To begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just noticing where in the body you feel</v>

1505
01:09:43.841 --> 01:09:48.070
<v Speaker 2>that movement might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stomach won't be the chest,</v>

1506
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.553
<v Speaker 2>you can't fit anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just gently placing your hand on the </v>

1507
01:09:52.451 --> 01:09:57.451
<v Speaker 2>stomach just to feel that movement as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow the breath.</v>

1508
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Just the help to to remain focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling,</v>

1509
01:10:18.461 --> 01:10:19.294
<v Speaker 2>that sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just starting to count the breaths just </v>

1510
01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:26.440
<v Speaker 2>silently to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you fill the rising sensation,</v>

1511
01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>it count one falling sensation two and </v>
<v Speaker 2>three and four just up to a count of 10.</v>

1512
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:41.023
<v Speaker 2>You starting again at one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try that a couple of times through </v>

1513
01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:44.574
<v Speaker 2>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for sure at some stage the mind's </v>

1514
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>going to get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon as you realize the mind's wandered,</v>

1515
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.073
<v Speaker 2>just gently acknowledging it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting the thought co and then just </v>

1516
01:11:27.141 --> 01:11:32.141
<v Speaker 2>coming back to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just for a moment,</v>

1517
01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1518
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.500
<v Speaker 2>letting go nav even any focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath.</v>

1519
01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So just letting the mind for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1520
01:11:56.831 --> 01:11:57.664
<v Speaker 2>Do whatever it wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wants the thing that I think just </v>

1521
01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:05.444
<v Speaker 2>allowing the mind to be free and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gently bringing the attention back </v>

1522
01:12:25.431 --> 01:12:30.431
<v Speaker 2>into the body that's coming back to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of contact of weight coming back</v>

1523
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:37.830
<v Speaker 2>into the space around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any sounds,</v>

1524
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:43.790
<v Speaker 2>sensations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you're ready,</v>

1525
01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 2>just gently open the eyes again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
