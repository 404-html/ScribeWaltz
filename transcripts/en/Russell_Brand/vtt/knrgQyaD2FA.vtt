1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.073
<v Speaker 1>So your perspective and your motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an optimistic one that you </v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>essentially believe that people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have extremist beliefs,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those beliefs are resourced,</v>

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.993
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a fundament fundamentalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an Islamic perspective or ethno </v>

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.853
<v Speaker 1>You think that these are almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary few bugs that human beings </v>

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:23.994
<v Speaker 1>passed through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are not essential states as </v>

8
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.014
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are interested in in meeting </v>

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the human being behind the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you believe that human being is more</v>

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more real,</v>

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>better than their group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each of these cases</v>

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 2>I do because what I've found in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing all the films that I've done at</v>

14
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 2>this point is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whatever the,</v>

15
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>the window do I always call it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>window dressing or whatever the brand is</v>

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 2>that might be different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

17
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:51.554
<v Speaker 2>So on the surface of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to look different to most </v>

18
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 2>people when it comes to a jihadi versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>a neo Nazi.</v>

19
00:00:58.521 --> 00:00:59.354
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are completely opposing </v>

20
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.483
<v Speaker 2>ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different people and </v>

21
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 2>therefore should be treated completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

22
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.983
<v Speaker 2>But what I found is that the type of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are attracted to these movements </v>

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.263
<v Speaker 2>and the type of vulnerabilities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those men possess that are being preyed </v>

24
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.404
<v Speaker 2>upon by people in a position to misuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever vulnerabilities that these men </v>

25
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 2>have for their own political gains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.970
<v Speaker 2>all the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychological,</v>

27
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social makeup of the,</v>

28
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>the guys across the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have found actually to be really,</v>

29
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 2>really similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>

30
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a matter of,</v>

31
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for meaning,</v>

32
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>searching for belonging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for a sense of purpose,</v>

33
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>searching for a brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camaraderie,</v>

34
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 2>searching for just a way of coping with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

35
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly changing world,</v>

36
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding themselves to be insignificant,</v>

37
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 2>powerless.</v>

38
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.603
<v Speaker 2>And then you have recruiters and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these movements that are filling </v>

40
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>those voids actively and cynically </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually filling those voids,</v>

41
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 2>not by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually by design.</v>

42
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>And I find that really troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also find that quite hopeful.</v>

43
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.313
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that these basic human </v>

44
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

45
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.453
<v Speaker 2>I am searching and have been searching </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of these things that I've just </v>

46
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 2>listed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

47
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:25.694
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it manifests itself different for me </v>

48
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 2>than it does for these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just for me,</v>

49
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of figuring out how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfy these,</v>

50
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.753
<v Speaker 2>these needs for young people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we satisfy and address these </v>

51
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities that that young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>

52
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:40.934
<v Speaker 2>And also how do we confront the feelings</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shame and humiliation and </v>

53
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:45.584
<v Speaker 2>powerlessness that so many people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they become instrumentalized by </v>

54
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 2>our politicians and by populism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you found a group regardless of yeah.</v>

55
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>How it superficially polarized the group</v>
<v Speaker 1>identities</v>

56
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.670
<v Speaker 2>of white supremacists or jihadist may </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem that there's a kind of uniformity.</v>

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

58
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

59
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.241
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

60
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 2>these movements are meeting these young </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

61
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>predominantly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously there are some women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>

63
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.713
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gender is a tremendous part of </v>

64
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.564
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

65
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.523
<v Speaker 2>I think a sense of masculinity or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of sort of toxic masculinity I </v>

66
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>think is absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely essential to this,</v>

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>to both movements or to any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremist movement.</v>

68
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's also systematically </v>

69
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 2>overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way that our media addresses</v>

70
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>extremists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the way that all politicians</v>

71
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>address extremism in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

72
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.043
<v Speaker 2>I think is not very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They constantly want to make it </v>

73
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.624
<v Speaker 2>something exotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something so impossible and monstrous </v>

74
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 2>because surely we can't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

75
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.314
<v Speaker 2>These people are just hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They possess these hideous views and </v>

76
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 2>less just sign them all off.</v>

77
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.493
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is they're all operating out </v>

78
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:10.771
<v Speaker 2>of really basic needs and those needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not being met in their life,</v>

79
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>in their immediate family life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in the wider society.</v>

80
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 2>That says more about us as a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it does about these men.</v>

81
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in,</v>

82
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:22.254
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in finding an excavating what those </v>

83
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 2>needs are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what those vulnerabilities are,</v>

84
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>look extremists of any kind of stripe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

85
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

86
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any form flourishes in,</v>

87
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in vacuums,</v>

88
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have Hamas and his wool line.</v>

89
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 2>All these kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 2>big names that we've heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They provide in,</v>

91
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>in circumstances and environments where </v>
<v Speaker 2>social services do not exist.</v>

92
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Education does not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not exist.</v>

94
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 2>healthcare does not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are filling those voids.</v>

96
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 2>So whether it's political voids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is economic voice,</v>

97
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.494
<v Speaker 2>or it is social and emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological voids in the lives of </v>

98
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These extremist groups,</v>

99
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever their brand is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fulfilling those,</v>

100
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 2>knowing what these lax and these voids </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in people's lives.</v>

101
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>So why do they know that while they </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

102
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.294
<v Speaker 2>and we are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is our political system not </v>

103
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.703
<v Speaker 2>addressing the social and economic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the political grievances that our young </v>

104
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 2>people have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

105
00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:29.651
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

106
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't excuse the way that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing to express that.</v>

107
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.743
<v Speaker 2>I think we can say at the beginning that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's is seeking to excuse the </v>

108
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>behavior of extreme.</v>

109
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.613
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
