21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Professor David Harvey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankie,</v>

22
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>very much for being our guest on under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin.</v>

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You'll hear somewhat to promote this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

24
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Marx capital and the madness of economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Why you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have you written this book?</v>

26
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And now?</v>

27
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

28
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved over several years </v>
<v Speaker 2>now what I call the mark's project,</v>

29
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:23.931
<v Speaker 2>which is to try to explain to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was mark's was talking about and</v>

30
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 2>to do it in terms which are simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being simplistic.</v>

31
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.993
<v Speaker 2>It's been quite a challenge to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has this marks is kind of a bit of a </v>

32
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.134
<v Speaker 2>hard read when you first read him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of academics spend a lot of </v>

33
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 2>their time trying to make marks more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated than it already is.</v>

34
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to make it simpler so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can grasp it.</v>

35
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And I had a series of books which have </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>

36
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And this is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one and it may not be the final</v>

37
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.800
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

38
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to put a lot of things together </v>

39
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.593
<v Speaker 2>in this book about what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the three volumes of </v>

40
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:57.564
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how will they relate to how the three </v>

41
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.444
<v Speaker 2>volumes relate to each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how coming out of that you get a </v>

42
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 2>picture of capitalist society and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence of what capital is about.</v>

43
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm trying to do in the </v>

44
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.644
<v Speaker 2>book and I'm hoping that people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick it up and read it and give a good </v>

45
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>shot at understanding it.</v>

46
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Given your stated objective of making </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital more accessible,</v>

47
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.353
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we'll start this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a paps illuminating a few simple </v>

48
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:27.904
<v Speaker 1>terms and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go through these questions </v>

49
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.663
<v Speaker 1>because this is an important topic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've looped into this cause are </v>

50
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>preemptive chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really getting off on,</v>

51
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to make sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>build sufficient foundations.</v>

52
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.513
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're not calling it das kapital </v>

53
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like how you're supposed to,</v>

54
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.763
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm using the English translation </v>

55
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 2>so I usually English language to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

56
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.203
<v Speaker 2>There are some problems about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>translation and obviously now that's </v>

57
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.034
<v Speaker 2>what I'm working from.</v>

58
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey cause it I suppose because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief to simplify it.</v>

59
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Firstly why he's based book so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

60
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean capital and though your book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is important as well.</v>

61
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to belittle your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said why is capital and then why is it</v>

62
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:19.734
<v Speaker 1>an important book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in there that's relevant to </v>

63
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.740
<v Speaker 1>people today in 2017 after we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry,</v>

64
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>their idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their negative stories about communism.</v>

65
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.983
<v Speaker 1>Why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why is capital one important thing </v>

66
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.113
<v Speaker 1>for us to understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

67
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism book is not about communism.</v>

68
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.933
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about as a critique of capitalism </v>

69
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.470
<v Speaker 2>and there's not even a critique of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism and every respect.</v>

70
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:47.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a critique of how,</v>

71
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 2>what I would call the engine of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist development,</v>

72
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

73
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.353
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the laws of accumulation of capital </v>

74
00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 2>work cause capitalism expansionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is constantly expanding.</v>

75
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.244
<v Speaker 2>And how does it expand and what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stresses does that do that does that </v>

76
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:08.900
<v Speaker 2>create amongst working people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of stresses in relationship to</v>

77
00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:09.734
<v Speaker 2>cultural evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of stress is in relationship </v>

78
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>to environmental questions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

79
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.504
<v Speaker 2>and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're surrounded obviously with all </v>

80
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:20.570
<v Speaker 2>of those questions about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

81
00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:21.404
<v Speaker 2>about cultural preservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about even the definition of what it is </v>

82
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.973
<v Speaker 2>means to be a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They having a big debate about that and </v>

83
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the United States right now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks at trump and says,</v>

84
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 2>is that the future of what humanity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to look like?</v>

85
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And the answer many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

86
00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:38.270
<v Speaker 2>we got to think of something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

87
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with all of those questions around,</v>

88
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know what it is that is </v>

89
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 2>driving capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>to do the kinds of things it does in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to exploitation,</v>

91
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.030
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social inequality,</v>

92
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.970
<v Speaker 2>cultural transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the production of new wants,</v>

93
00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:58.280
<v Speaker 2>needs and desires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those sorts of things.</v>

94
00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>We need to have a theory of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mark's is the first person,</v>

95
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and we're ready to come to terms with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that theory might look like</v>

96
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>in the 1850s mark's was able to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this critique of capitalism,</v>

97
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>what likely trends and what the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of capitalism would be.</v>

98
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Even though this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.613
<v Speaker 1>150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the reasons you've written </v>

100
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:17.151
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

101
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Even at 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was able to predict what was it about</v>

102
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>capitalism then that made it evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this economic system,</v>

103
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.443
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

104
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

105
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 2>and it has to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to grow with the,</v>

106
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 2>what we call a compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

107
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of a 3% per year is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small amount of,</v>

108
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new commodities and so on back in 1850.</v>

109
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>But by the time you get to 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge amount of new commodities.</v>

110
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's got to grow and at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or rather it's gonna hit limits to that.</v>

111
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.120
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a simple observation.</v>

113
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mark's made then,</v>

114
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>because if you change the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism to the word elephant,</v>

115
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

116
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>in [inaudible] it is the elephant has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to grow.</v>

117
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's going to fill the room and kill us </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

118
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you just pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

119
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

120
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a growth machine and it has to grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the only way in which you</v>

121
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of show a profitability profit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an access.</v>

122
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to produce the access in </v>

123
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:16.994
<v Speaker 2>order for capital smart and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to use that access to produce more </v>

124
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they say it's endless.</v>

125
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:24.614
<v Speaker 2>Accumulation is one of the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game necessarily and essentially </v>

126
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>impractical filling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A practical need is about creating needs</v>

127
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>that are not there order that it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to have compound growth.</v>

128
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>So how come that that observation was </v>
<v Speaker 2>made in 1850 how covert and then go,</v>

129
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point,</v>

130
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop this capitalism then.</v>

131
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's plenty of room to expand</v>

132
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.064
<v Speaker 2>back in 1850 I mean the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world was there and of course we are to </v>

133
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>colonialism.</v>

134
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.503
<v Speaker 2>We had imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had all of the expansions around the </v>

135
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:53.444
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's plenty of room for that </v>

136
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 2>growth to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.274
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I call a capital was getting into </v>

138
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>what I call a special fix a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

139
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super amount of commodities,</v>

140
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

141
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and capacity and Britain.</v>

142
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

143
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British would lend to Argentina to </v>

144
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>build railroads and the railroads will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be produced in Britain.</v>

145
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.074
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Argentina gets caught into the kind </v>

146
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 2>of the circulation of capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

147
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>so there were plenty of places like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for capital to grow into.</v>

148
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 2>But now there's no place left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

149
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe Africa still is not completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone,</v>

150
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>but pretty much everywhere in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been caught into it right now.</v>

151
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.274
<v Speaker 2>So growth from here on out is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>feasible when it was feasible back in </v>

152
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>1850.</v>

153
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.661
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

154
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 2>even if someone has said out in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

155
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:40.604
<v Speaker 2>if we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have to indefinitely grow this </v>

156
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.244
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will necessarily bring about </v>

157
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 2>destruction and the responses I was now </v>
<v Speaker 2>bie cheese,</v>

158
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>no one was bothered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

159
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.010
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.853
<v Speaker 2>you know United States was only just </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning and and yeah they all United </v>

161
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continent sort of and the North American</v>

162
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.064
<v Speaker 2>continent to get to occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would I be right then in asking David </v>

163
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 2>and beyond dry and more importantly than</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

164
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.433
<v Speaker 2>Bloody clever in asking that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that capitalism a sourced from </v>

165
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.073
<v Speaker 2>imperialism and colonialism is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic model that fits the proceeding </v>

166
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.644
<v Speaker 2>ideology which had been a rather more </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously in ethical system of </v>

167
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 2>domination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I ran a capital has always been about </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical expansion.</v>

169
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.564
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you call it colonialism or you </v>

170
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:25.784
<v Speaker 2>call imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually prefer to call it and even </v>

171
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:28.814
<v Speaker 2>geographical development because </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes imperialism makes it is too </v>

172
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>simple a term cause cause right now if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the way in which commodities</v>

173
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:38.751
<v Speaker 2>are made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.584
<v Speaker 2>one piece is made in Taiwan and one lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>says made in South Korea and other </v>

175
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.154
<v Speaker 2>pieces made in Mexico and then it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>put together in the United States and </v>

176
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is capital in all of this?</v>

177
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 2>So right now it's a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated kind of story.</v>

178
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where's,</v>

179
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's all this work going?</v>

180
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>But she's producing the commodities </v>
<v Speaker 2>again on our table.</v>

181
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.273
<v Speaker 2>And one of the questions I always like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to start by geography classes off with </v>

182
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>was questions of where does your </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast come from?</v>

183
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And it was kind of really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can't go,</v>

184
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.340
<v Speaker 2>oh I never thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

185
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 2>they kind of say well it comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supermarket and you had no,</v>

186
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:11.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

187
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel aware there's all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff come from.</v>

188
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:14.803
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after about three weeks of asking </v>

189
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 2>the same question and people will say </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

190
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.423
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have breakfast this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now telling me this question but I </v>

191
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 2>don't like this question and I'll let me</v>
<v Speaker 2>my breakfast and no,</v>

192
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More of a puzzle that rain.</v>

193
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.793
<v Speaker 2>When did that crowd the cloud accumulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why was that card that I'm not </v>

194
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>coming to your classes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

195
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I,</v>

196
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of dropouts from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>geography class cause I kept asking that</v>

197
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:39.954
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

198
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>But in a way a capitalism is a vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a particular type of mentality,</v>

199
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.010
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of about what,</v>

200
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.610
<v Speaker 2>well it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 2>the famous kind of statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greed is good.</v>

202
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.900
<v Speaker 2>There's that kind of a side bar about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ashley.</v>

203
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.910
<v Speaker 2>The mentality now is shifted a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think a lot of capitalism is,</v>

204
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 2>is about a complicated relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data's and I,</v>

205
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.623
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that are talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this last book a lot is the way in </v>

206
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 2>which the future has got foreclosed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

207
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.523
<v Speaker 2>Bad debt is a claim on future labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a claim on your future library </v>

208
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.280
<v Speaker 2>and if you heavily in debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to pay it off.</v>

209
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.503
<v Speaker 2>So the incentive you have right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not took on is is getting rid of the </v>

210
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.274
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said</v>

211
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to be rich and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>slave.</v>

212
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is exactly,</v>

213
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about foreclosure and it's about,</v>

214
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.014
<v Speaker 2>it's about not emancipating you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about imprisoning you in a network </v>

215
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 2>of a debt relations which have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

216
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.631
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 2>student debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in states now,</v>

218
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 2>we've got these horrible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>student debt,</v>

219
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>which really full close is the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people for new in remarkable ways.</v>

220
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.223
<v Speaker 1>If you couldn't remove morality from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lens of analysis in a source of </v>

221
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 1>ingenious in it's mendacity in a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways in which he dominating.</v>

222
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

223
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Mark's does not make a moral argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

224
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.303
<v Speaker 2>it's not a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a moral argument they'd </v>

225
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.743
<v Speaker 2>seize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the inevitability of </v>

226
00:11:13.451 --> 00:11:14.284
<v Speaker 2>mendacity.</v>

227
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] bearing might like then,</v>

228
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.690
<v Speaker 1>this is still the simple bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast for me and one to z,</v>

229
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but that is the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

230
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a quick way of doing that?</v>

231
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism I think is generally spoken.</v>

232
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:34.104
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a transitional a system and which </v>

233
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.383
<v Speaker 2>capitalism has put down a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints so that you have social </v>

234
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>democracy and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think traditionally it was seen as</v>

235
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 2>a stepping stone to full communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

236
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:54.321
<v Speaker 2>which would lead to the abolition of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>class relation between and labor and the</v>

237
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:56.494
<v Speaker 2>abolition of class privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And eventually of course the abolition </v>

238
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>of the capitalist state apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So communism is seen as something,</v>

239
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>a further stage going beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

240
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.491
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

241
00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:08.324
<v Speaker 2>whereas under socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of the capitalism would still </v>

242
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:12.454
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The market system was still be their </v>

243
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>money of the sort of what we use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And cumulate was still be there,</v>

244
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>but under social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under communism,</v>

245
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that would then disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>

246
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 2>for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

247
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>is a mode of analysis as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

248
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.180
<v Speaker 2>which is a critical way of thinking.</v>

249
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

250
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:32.764
<v Speaker 2>it says to you when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he got some sort of situation and </v>

251
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to try to understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell is happening,</v>

252
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to see by surface </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances,</v>

253
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to see it by ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of bluster.</v>

254
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.013
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do an analysis and for </v>

255
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:46.444
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what's really going on </v>

256
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:49.744
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you understand what's really </v>

257
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:51.484
<v Speaker 2>going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can then act against what is really </v>

258
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:54.844
<v Speaker 2>happening in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a deep way rather than simply deal </v>

259
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 2>with surface symptoms.</v>

260
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I see subcutaneous analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just observation of symptoms.</v>

261
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.083
<v Speaker 1>When you observe the symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're necessarily confined by the </v>

262
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:11.330
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Arthur.</v>

263
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things mark said was if,</v>

264
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:13.890
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

265
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.580
<v Speaker 2>if everything was as it seemed to be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface,</v>

267
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 2>there will be no need for science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we look at the,</v>

268
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.520
<v Speaker 2>we look at the sun and it looks like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound's going around the earth,</v>

269
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.290
<v Speaker 2>but we find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it isn't,</v>

270
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rotating.</v>

271
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just another business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Write that down.</v>

272
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>This is Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why,</v>

273
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 2>that's why mark's means by appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the reality behind it.</v>

275
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:37.341
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

276
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

277
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:39.204
<v Speaker 2>most scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we recognize there's a </v>

278
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:43.200
<v Speaker 2>difference between symptoms and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

279
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.290
<v Speaker 2>what the underlying causes and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical practitioners would,</v>

280
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:47.124
<v Speaker 2>would recognize that difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mark's is trying to do a kind of </v>

281
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.693
<v Speaker 2>constantly trying to do a forensic kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of inspection of a capitalist system to </v>

282
00:13:54.721 --> 00:13:57.900
<v Speaker 2>find out what these symptoms which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see on the surface,</v>

283
00:13:57.901 --> 00:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>like increasing inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

284
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>where those symptoms are coming from in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of was producing them.</v>

285
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:04.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

286
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

287
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>may I ask when a law recently we spoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Al Gore,</v>

288
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>we spoke to Al Gore about climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

289
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>talking to us about like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

291
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:15.994
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose he's a raise on debt sre and </v>

292
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.893
<v Speaker 1>explicit mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to have some nobility about </v>

293
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it is to galvanize and enthuse people </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being sort of responsible.</v>

294
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But when I was talking to Al Gore are </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept thinking and in fact saying,</v>

295
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute.</v>

296
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Speaker 1>If you need that to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't you do the best and they've got to</v>

297
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 1>be sort of some stern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitive regulation of that.</v>

298
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.563
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it will just carry on like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>then this guy's regular like defy in an </v>

299
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>absolute regulation of energy companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of traits,</v>

300
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in in the capitol,</v>

301
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>is it dealing with my same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's no point just asking.</v>

302
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 1>People have you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn the tap off,</v>

303
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 1>are they clean their teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more important than say,</v>

304
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>well you can't have that amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

305
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't operate in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that way.</v>

306
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 1>He's that Crista does that critique?</v>

307
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does.</v>

308
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.103
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what my view of a Al Gore is he </v>

309
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:13.954
<v Speaker 2>thinks that you can actually solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change problem within the </v>

310
00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:18.094
<v Speaker 2>parameters of a capitalist system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't want to do away with </v>

311
00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>capitalism and we spray is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect capitalism from the consequences</v>

312
00:15:26.351 --> 00:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>of climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I take the view that a,</v>

313
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.813
<v Speaker 2>the main producer of climate change is </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the driving force of capital </v>

314
00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.134
<v Speaker 2>accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And until you've dealt with the driving </v>

315
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:37.354
<v Speaker 2>force of capital accumulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get all these promises </v>

316
00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:43.780
<v Speaker 2>about new technologies which are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to solve the problem and so on.</v>

317
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.093
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to get a </v>

318
00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:49.600
<v Speaker 2>fundamental kind of a solution without </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging capital itself.</v>

319
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of futile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

320
00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:51.774
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of sort of using the means</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a kind of a contemporary consumer </v>

321
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:56.214
<v Speaker 1>society in that it's about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual choice and usually </v>

322
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>individually recycle and individually do</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make these kind of choices?</v>

323
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing I'm very interested in </v>

324
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:07.140
<v Speaker 1>and I keep asking people about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

325
00:16:07.141 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So I'll ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing I read.</v>

326
00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:09.714
<v Speaker 1>Gandy said they went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is him that point ass kicking out </v>

327
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the British and then ash just doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their job for him.</v>

328
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what India is a country of 70,000</v>

329
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:22.260
<v Speaker 1>villages that's built on craft economies</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody works all the time.</v>

330
00:16:22.261 --> 00:16:23.094
<v Speaker 1>We have to focus less on mass production</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think instead of production for the </v>

331
00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 1>masses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to do this,</v>

332
00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:27.894
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to break out spell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've commodification as long as people </v>

333
00:16:30.331 --> 00:16:31.920
<v Speaker 1>are thinking we've got to get more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more stuff,</v>

334
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is where it starts to interface</v>

335
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.500
<v Speaker 1>with the individual bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this thing he said about 70,000</v>

336
00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 1>village each one or to po it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous,</v>

337
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.530
<v Speaker 1>independent and trading only in access </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being where possible.</v>

338
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Self-Sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he saying there?</v>

339
00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Candy is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

340
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.733
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a utopian vision in some ways and </v>

341
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:51.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against Utopian visions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need that water if you were right </v>

342
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you do?</v>

343
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

344
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like a little bit of Utopian.</v>

345
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.491
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

346
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't entirely lie on,</v>

347
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I own</v>

348
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.200
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

349
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.910
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

350
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:07.744
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well candy's saying is that there is a </v>

351
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:11.380
<v Speaker 2>way of organizing production and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption,</v>

352
00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:12.214
<v Speaker 2>which is radically different from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is given by the industrialization </v>

353
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.410
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was faced with a,</v>

354
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nairu and develop mentalism which was to</v>

355
00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 2>bring in factories and solve the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

356
00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And a Gandy saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was another kind of solution where</v>

357
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:30.364
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem with that is in a </v>

358
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:37.120
<v Speaker 2>situation of very strong population </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and population growth.</v>

359
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 70,000</v>

360
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:40.780
<v Speaker 2>villages were all but the growing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

361
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are other issues which arise </v>

362
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:45.154
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

363
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.183
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

364
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.210
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with local famines under</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

365
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that kind of man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get crop failures amongst say,</v>

366
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.190
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>villages in the said part,</v>

367
00:17:55.191 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and how do you support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 2>what happens there?</v>

369
00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.723
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the haze assumption is that they'll </v>

370
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.943
<v Speaker 2>never be a crop failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas historically there are crop </v>

371
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>failures because of climate issues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>her malpractices and things like that.</v>

372
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So you need to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

373
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:11.274
<v Speaker 2>an organization that can deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the possibility of crop failures </v>

374
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:15.770
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

375
00:18:15.771 --> 00:18:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and can redistribute wealth between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>villages when it's,</v>

376
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 2>when it's really necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other difficulty is when they're</v>

377
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:23.454
<v Speaker 2>independent and autonomous villages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the villages will start to get </v>

378
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 2>very afterward and very rich and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them will get very poor.</v>

379
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:29.934
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequalities of income is between </v>

380
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:32.664
<v Speaker 2>different villages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gandy didn't think about those sorts of </v>

381
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:36.970
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

382
00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:37.804
<v Speaker 2>and I think you have to think about form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of organization will put all those </v>

383
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:41.484
<v Speaker 2>village economists together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've believed that in Arcos into </v>

384
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.933
<v Speaker 2>Elysium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

385
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

386
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.793
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose a version of what Gandy was </v>

387
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:53.990
<v Speaker 2>talking you could go to and our coasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and colorism from,</v>

388
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what he's talking about.</v>

389
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he would want no bad at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

390
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

391
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.883
<v Speaker 2>but you could move in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course there's a lot of interest </v>

392
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:02.304
<v Speaker 2>these days in solidarity economies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous development and this place </v>

393
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:08.904
<v Speaker 2>and as a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great faith in autonomy at the </v>

395
00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.084
<v Speaker 2>seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our autonomy is going to be the </v>

396
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I answer to that is,</v>

397
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I think autonomy is a good thing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're doing with it,</v>

398
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.843
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't have autonomy </v>

399
00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:20.514
<v Speaker 2>relations between autonomous groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a great deal of any </v>

400
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:25.020
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get the famine problem,</v>

401
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get all sorts of issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this kind,</v>

402
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have to be sold by,</v>

403
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.563
<v Speaker 2>by integrating a local economies with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other in such a way that they can </v>

404
00:19:35.101 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>some mutually support each other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>times of difficulty.</v>

405
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.200
<v Speaker 2>And so it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

406
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.240
<v Speaker 2>presumably what you're agreeing for Wa </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital is arguing for is that the,</v>

407
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.293
<v Speaker 2>the role of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the state has to have a benevolent </v>

408
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and redistributive role and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

409
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>There has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well put it this way,</v>

410
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.050
<v Speaker 2>they have to be mechanisms of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>redistribution and,</v>

411
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the like and,</v>

412
00:19:59.051 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 2>and mutual support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has to be organized.</v>

413
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:02.904
<v Speaker 2>Now when he used the term state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we often think about the capitalist </v>

414
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>state and I don't like the capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

415
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 2>but we do need a form of governments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>governmental inter interventions.</v>

416
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And I like some of these things where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about,</v>

417
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] for example,</v>

418
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.040
<v Speaker 2>and this idea about municipal socialism </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

419
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:19.431
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

420
00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 2>and local socialism days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have autonomous,</v>

421
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assemblies.</v>

422
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.243
<v Speaker 2>But then there will be a super assembly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would start to deal with the </v>

423
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 2>relations between and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he'd have a super,</v>

424
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:33.570
<v Speaker 2>super assembly in which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in,</v>

426
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 2>say North America gets connected was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was happening in South Africa and,</v>

427
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 2>and issues like climate change are </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed because you need an a,</v>

428
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>a global organization to deal with.</v>

429
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.523
<v Speaker 2>The climate change problem is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be dealt with simply by everybody </v>

430
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 2>changing behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you mentioned earlier.</v>

431
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 2>So you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need some form of,</v>

432
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 2>of governmental structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coordination.</v>

433
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.501
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

434
00:20:58.501 --> 00:20:59.820
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

435
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the autonomy argument is,</v>

436
00:21:02.271 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 2>is powerful up to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it needs to go much further.</v>

437
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 2>When I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people say,</v>

438
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:08.164
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in favor of the capitalist state </v>

439
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:09.994
<v Speaker 2>and you just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a state power and we know </v>

440
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>the state is a disaster and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the current state is a disaster,</v>

441
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an instrument of capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>domination.</v>

442
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now that it was even in the 19th</v>

443
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:24.451
<v Speaker 2>century and we see it being a militarize</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it can suppress social opposition and</v>

444
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 2>social movements and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

445
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:27.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

446
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:28.054
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really against the kind of </v>

447
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:31.250
<v Speaker 2>capitalist state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

448
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.570
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean I'm against some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of form of government,</v>

449
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look and deal with these much broader </v>

450
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 2>global kind of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How will do you,</v>

451
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.510
<v Speaker 1>how would we ever arrive at that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they,</v>

452
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.583
<v Speaker 1>how would we have a form of state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was benevolent and acting in the </v>

453
00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:50.114
<v Speaker 1>interests of its population?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can you now answer a question and </v>

454
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you must be continually called upon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that,</v>

455
00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>where like I'm glad that you did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions between socialism,</v>

456
00:22:00.921 --> 00:22:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and communism and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you address the great failures of</v>

457
00:22:05.451 --> 00:22:07.220
<v Speaker 1>communism in the last century?</v>

458
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first off,</v>

459
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think necessarily the communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a great failure.</v>

460
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

461
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.781
<v Speaker 2>I called her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

462
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:17.220
<v Speaker 2>style and is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lacks.</v>

463
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

464
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some very,</v>

465
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:22.320
<v Speaker 2>very bad parts of that history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

466
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.183
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what was interesting was after </v>

467
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:29.601
<v Speaker 2>the collapse of the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life expectancy in the Soviet Union went</v>

468
00:22:30.001 --> 00:22:33.990
<v Speaker 2>down in Russia know enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>

469
00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:36.360
<v Speaker 2>they're suddenly found all their rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>or disappeared.</v>

470
00:22:36.361 --> 00:22:37.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

471
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:41.820
<v Speaker 2>so I think we are wrong to kind of say </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that the communist dead was,</v>

472
00:22:41.821 --> 00:22:42.600
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

473
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.433
<v Speaker 2>was terrible.</v>

474
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Mostly I've been propagandized to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

475
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.100
<v Speaker 1>My perception of what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car communist union,</v>

476
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.123
<v Speaker 1>that century has been totally realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really understand it cause </v>

477
00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause I don't know.</v>

478
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

479
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.533
<v Speaker 2>look I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get in a situation of </v>

480
00:22:59.021 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>saying everything was great and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful and a no criticism.</v>

481
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.393
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at a place like Cuba and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the health care delivery in </v>

482
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic as well.</v>

483
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's some very good things.</v>

485
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things.</v>

486
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:14.894
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I think we have to address </v>

487
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.003
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things that seem like I was </v>

488
00:23:20.661 --> 00:23:21.494
<v Speaker 1>always good fan on the telly once with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman that was doing a documentary said </v>

489
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>it seems that communism in Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism unconsciously or inadvertently</v>

490
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.493
<v Speaker 1>mimicked this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social structure that immediately </v>

491
00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:36.470
<v Speaker 1>proceeded it czar Islam in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of its declared objectives,</v>

492
00:23:36.471 --> 00:23:37.304
<v Speaker 1>it has a hierarchal structures and did </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to oppression and persecution of a </v>

493
00:23:40.971 --> 00:23:41.804
<v Speaker 1>cliff.</v>

494
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

495
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't deny that a lot that,</v>

496
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.244
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh we have to give credibility to some </v>

497
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.240
<v Speaker 2>of the things that happened on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commute or something.</v>

498
00:23:55.241 --> 00:23:56.074
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I have to say is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that most of us have the </v>

499
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:03.710
<v Speaker 2>standard of living we have today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the communist threat.</v>

500
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.220
<v Speaker 2>If the communist threat and not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>there after 1945 you know,</v>

501
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.103
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have had the delivery of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare state such as it was and all </v>

502
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things which allow us </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing life expectancy.</v>

503
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

504
00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:18.804
<v Speaker 2>over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life expectancy has been going down in </v>

505
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:23.120
<v Speaker 2>some of the major capitalist countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>

506
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:24.570
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cameron,</v>

507
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I think as the first prime minister to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave with a lower life expectancy,</v>

508
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.303
<v Speaker 2>the money came in.</v>

509
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gone up,</v>

510
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you should say the armed guards outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>his house.</v>

511
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's happening or that gazer let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

512
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.513
<v Speaker 1>it is how bill crawling around </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and there's an ambulance on </v>

513
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

514
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 1>that was having to anyone else elaborate</v>
<v Speaker 1>grove.</v>

515
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I must be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All hell bill or outside one else.</v>

516
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Look,</v>

517
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.310
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a thing and it goes on basically</v>

518
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 1>my position and more first though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be,</v>

519
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I need substantiated as it will continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

520
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need radical change.</v>

521
00:24:57.441 --> 00:24:58.274
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that does seem to be the </v>

522
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>dismantling of a capitalist state and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new system based on sharing.</v>

523
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 1>But when we even appear to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to like,</v>

524
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:07.890
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything,</v>

525
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.540
<v Speaker 1>an umbrella under which she had stolen </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a more,</v>

526
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.211
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.740
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love a bit of Shea Guevara,</v>

528
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:13.723
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've tried saying that in Miami </v>

529
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.733
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kickbacks pretty fierce in her life </v>

530
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the floors and because of,</v>

531
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've been,</v>

532
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in the 80s and Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

533
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a,</v>

534
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.820
<v Speaker 1>a town of two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two sides.</v>

535
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it very hard to unpick that.</v>

536
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And anything that seems revivalist are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic about communism,</v>

537
00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 1>that's already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people were like,</v>

538
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.344
<v Speaker 1>no thanks mate.</v>

539
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

540
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

541
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been interested in some of these,</v>

542
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs,</v>

543
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.270
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

544
00:25:46.271 --> 00:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in northern Syria,</v>

545
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.710
<v Speaker 2>the Kurds have reorganized things along </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a assembly structures,</v>

546
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly inspired by the,</v>

547
00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:56.764
<v Speaker 2>an alternative notion of democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that right now some of the </v>

548
00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:01.354
<v Speaker 2>progressive mass in Spain or trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a way of creating more </v>

549
00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:06.124
<v Speaker 2>democratic assembly structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's a lot of </v>

550
00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:11.500
<v Speaker 2>experimentation that needs to be done on</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

551
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the big problem with communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>was they had us and what I call a single</v>

552
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:16.534
<v Speaker 2>bullet theory of social change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was put in classic Marxist terms </v>

553
00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:25.450
<v Speaker 2>that the productive forces that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could command production,</v>

554
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.703
<v Speaker 2>then you'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of society would take care of </v>

555
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:30.490
<v Speaker 2>everything in a proper kind of way.</v>

556
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to work on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

557
00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:33.574
<v Speaker 2>on a whole range of different issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>including sort of culture relation to </v>

558
00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:40.720
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have to deal with a problem right</v>

559
00:26:40.721 --> 00:26:42.430
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fundamental to me,</v>

560
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:43.264
<v Speaker 2>which is what I call global alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The alienation of populations </v>

561
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 2>politically from their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their daily life possibilities.</v>

562
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got alienated populations all</v>

563
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 2>over the world who then do crazy things </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

564
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be passive for a while and then</v>

565
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:02.670
<v Speaker 2>something happens and you get these sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of seemingly irrational outbreaks of,</v>

566
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of craziness and they erect elect Donald</v>

567
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Trump and do things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think alienation is one of the big,</v>

568
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:11.004
<v Speaker 2>big issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have populations that are </v>

569
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:13.944
<v Speaker 2>alienated then then you can't address it</v>
<v Speaker 2>by sort of sign obote communist at that </v>

570
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>cause there was there as Eileen a pillar</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I as alienated from political parties</v>

571
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.560
<v Speaker 2>like the Communist parties and so on as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are from anything else.</v>

572
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.393
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard then to rebuild some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a trust with Eileen knighted </v>

573
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>populations and that's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political work to do.</v>

574
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction for me between uh,</v>

575
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.903
<v Speaker 2>what might be called a social media is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of communication and social media </v>

576
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 2>leading to forms of organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The communicative forms are very good,</v>

577
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.023
<v Speaker 2>the organizational forms are very bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and we've really got to think </v>

578
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 2>about how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to construct organizational forms.</v>

579
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with you entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not nostalgic about,</v>

580
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Communists did except that,</v>

581
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to healthcare and that </v>

582
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.281
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>

583
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>well we should look at how the Cubans </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it and no one an education.</v>

584
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.563
<v Speaker 2>We should look at the,</v>

585
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.653
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand you're in now matched by </v>

586
00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:12.574
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of the original idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the veracity of the critique and the </v>

587
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>possibility of components of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you said that great.</v>

588
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It kind of was how many take that down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it looks.</v>

589
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm interested is it will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded is open or causes.</v>

590
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

591
00:28:25.931 --> 00:28:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I've seen endorsement that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the poster.</v>

592
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.010
<v Speaker 1>You say to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

593
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give that in as a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As my phd,</v>

594
00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:33.604
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the math on that begins with </v>

595
00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:35.404
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really going to have to start </v>

596
00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:41.581
<v Speaker 1>listening in those lectures and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes that you like that and uh,</v>

597
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I have a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so ego led.</v>

598
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:44.763
<v Speaker 1>If someone's nice to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes me about an hour to recover </v>

599
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.923
<v Speaker 1>from my graces because I've been given a</v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment that's just take a while to </v>

600
00:28:51.371 --> 00:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>reflect on the compliment and the move </v>
<v Speaker 1>on with the interview.</v>

601
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.033
<v Speaker 1>And my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that w let's say what's needed is </v>

602
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.590
<v Speaker 1>something that whilst it may be derived </v>
<v Speaker 1>from or capital or capital or booklet,</v>

603
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I've only just learned to say correctly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you've made can be,</v>

604
00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it like that.</v>

605
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I suppose David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that sort of interests me,</v>

606
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm doing this podcast is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that change is possible.</v>

607
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I sense that we are being lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I S I can feel I the,</v>

608
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.603
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument that you made about </v>

609
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:28.300
<v Speaker 1>alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

610
00:29:28.301 --> 00:29:30.550
<v Speaker 1>it's so in evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

611
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.443
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to that Cuba when I was quite </v>

612
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:35.890
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 and it was magnificent.</v>

613
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I was there of all things to record a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing gum commercial.</v>

614
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>It should the most vacuous product </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginable,</v>

615
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.723
<v Speaker 1>not even nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the act of mastication as a ritual </v>

616
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and an idea while people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>

617
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.073
<v Speaker 1>And while there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily I'm a drug addict because of </v>

618
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.341
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was then,</v>

619
00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm clean now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that wherever I go,</v>

620
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I have to go and find for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where the drugs are.</v>

621
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>So that means you'd have to get off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails.</v>

622
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 1>You have to go down the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found myself in these things called</v>

623
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Barrios in Havana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it,</v>

624
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I liked the people and I liked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>murals.</v>

625
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And there was a sense of Julie and glory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and potentiality and caused from the 50s</v>

626
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:14.884
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just streets painted by people in </v>

627
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 1>this presence of people and people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

628
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:20.613
<v Speaker 1>And as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of that set alienation that </v>

629
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 1>comes when you don't participate in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

630
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 1>when you don't participate in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

631
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 1>when you know you have no power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you have no meaning,</v>

632
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 1>how lost you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt something different then,</v>

633
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but I was on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

634
00:30:35.621 --> 00:30:38.830
<v Speaker 1>all of my experiences were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtered through trucks,</v>

635
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

636
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and that was before I knew that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody good then.</v>

637
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 1>live here and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

639
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.500
<v Speaker 1>But what I feel like when we are posing </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea to people now,</v>

640
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I think what like w in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

641
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>what did Lenin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky,</v>

642
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:57.844
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take from that book capital and use in </v>

643
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.900
<v Speaker 1>the revolution in coal museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how did it become that,</v>

644
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:05.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

645
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

646
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the failure that it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you take as failure,</v>

647
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>either the fall of the Berlin Wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the Soviet Union,</v>

648
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>and what has happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia now.</v>

649
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

650
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.743
<v Speaker 2>See that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a question I often get asked to </v>

651
00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:19.530
<v Speaker 2>my back away from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of say,</v>

652
00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

653
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

654
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Lennon and trust gay and Bacara and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

655
00:31:24.301 --> 00:31:25.134
<v Speaker 2>I read Capitol and I took certain things</v>
<v Speaker 2>from him and I did certain things from </v>

656
00:31:28.101 --> 00:31:30.750
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our job right now is to read capital and</v>

657
00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:33.480
<v Speaker 2>find out what we want to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What shall we did?</v>

658
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

659
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first off,</v>

660
00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you gotta learn how to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

662
00:31:39.121 --> 00:31:42.500
<v Speaker 2>and that is not initially an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's horrible.</v>

663
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I hope some of those things I ride help </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get into it.</v>

664
00:31:45.331 --> 00:31:46.920
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be vital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

665
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to do that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>really important.</v>

666
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

667
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have these things on the web where</v>

668
00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 2>you can do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

669
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a course on Marx's kapital </v>
<v Speaker 2>volume one and volume two on the web,</v>

670
00:31:58.441 --> 00:32:00.540
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can take it on the web.</v>

671
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

672
00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:03.570
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open it up.</v>

673
00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:04.404
<v Speaker 2>But in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that we understand what it </v>

674
00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:08.360
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

675
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.313
<v Speaker 2>that miles is really teaching us about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of this system and know that </v>

676
00:32:13.621 --> 00:32:14.454
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to this is not what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be on the surface to can we </v>

677
00:32:17.671 --> 00:32:19.890
<v Speaker 2>develop a way of critique?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want,</v>

678
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.083
<v Speaker 2>I want to educate people if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily to regurgitate knocks </v>

679
00:32:25.141 --> 00:32:25.974
<v Speaker 2>cause that's not the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to use his mode of an analysis so </v>

680
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you can start to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay these populations that alienated,</v>

681
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.810
<v Speaker 2>why are they alienated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the alienation come from?</v>

682
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Once it got to do with the nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Labor process,</v>

683
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Speaker 2>why is it labor process the way it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>these days?</v>

684
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.523
<v Speaker 2>Why did capitalist technology decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wanted a labor process which </v>

685
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:47.700
<v Speaker 2>disempowered the Labor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

686
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Why is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that there?</v>

687
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as [inaudible] says,</v>

688
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:52.394
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful thing where he starts off</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these chapters and he kind of </v>

689
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:54.921
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

690
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Stuart Mill has this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

691
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.094
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all this labor saving machinery </v>

692
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:00.224
<v Speaker 2>right now and you've ever thought this </v>
<v Speaker 2>labor saving machinery but lighten the </v>

693
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.314
<v Speaker 2>load of labor and John Single.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the funny thing is is it seems that </v>

694
00:33:06.511 --> 00:33:08.090
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actually,</v>

695
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.250
<v Speaker 2>it makes it a lot of the labor of worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Marxists,</v>

696
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.250
<v Speaker 2>but of course it does because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose of the machinery's not delight,</v>

697
00:33:14.251 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 2>lighten the load of labor is to extract </v>
<v Speaker 2>more value and more surplus value,</v>

698
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 2>a more profit from the labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

699
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>if the machine can help you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that's what it does.</v>

700
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.643
<v Speaker 2>So this is where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this gives you an understanding of </v>

701
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 2>capitalist technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which evaded Don's do at mill,</v>

702
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>but we smog sees very clearly and we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clearly and say,</v>

703
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>actually the purpose of technology could</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

704
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:36.883
<v Speaker 2>There are all kinds of person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was military and all the rest of </v>

705
00:33:38.481 --> 00:33:39.314
<v Speaker 2>it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the big purposes of it is to </v>

706
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 2>disempower the labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

707
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 2>And and when the Labor is disempowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

708
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.990
<v Speaker 2>They become alienated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

709
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:48.883
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start behaving in an out of the </v>

710
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.163
<v Speaker 2>united way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you go at least things </v>

711
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>sort of going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of saying,</v>

712
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.573
<v Speaker 2>well these are the kinds of insights </v>
<v Speaker 2>that come out of reading Marx's capital </v>

713
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>and you kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

714
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I've got that insight,</v>

715
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.993
<v Speaker 2>I can't look at any discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological change and imagine it's </v>

716
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 2>got some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some socialist utopia attached to it.</v>

717
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 2>As you know how some of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are writing these days do the artificial</v>

718
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:14.670
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is the new socialist utopia</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

719
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Well you see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber,</v>

720
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber starts as a kind of sharing economy</v>

721
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:20.174
<v Speaker 2>and the next thing you know it's become </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalized and somebody become a </v>

722
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 2>billionaire out of it.</v>

723
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You got high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the ability of the system.</v>

724
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Is capitalism good morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically it's,</v>

725
00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:32.250
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very big obstacle.</v>

726
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take anything like I,</v>

727
00:34:34.391 --> 00:34:35.224
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my understanding of it is it primarily </v>

728
00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:37.334
<v Speaker 1>over the way that it interacts with </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and creativity and how you can </v>

729
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.780
<v Speaker 1>see mimicked in its narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

730
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central floor iee for example,</v>

731
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.673
<v Speaker 1>take hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which begins as sort of very defiant </v>

732
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.020
<v Speaker 1>then goes through a stage of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopian and beautiful and then oh,</v>

733
00:34:52.021 --> 00:34:52.854
<v Speaker 1>becomes commodified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes clearly a product and to some </v>

734
00:34:54.931 --> 00:34:55.764
<v Speaker 1>degree about products and about commerce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and about acquisition and about like </v>

735
00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:04.270
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the ideology is so endemic,</v>

736
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's so all encompassing that it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible.</v>

737
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So you say that part of capitalism's DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it its own concealment,</v>

738
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.860
<v Speaker 1>it's own consuming is a primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

739
00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Once it's concealed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his self care can continue.</v>

740
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Now what I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.370
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about lean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:35:18.371 --> 00:35:19.204
<v Speaker 1>the system and the floors were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system who obviously when you say you </v>

743
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:24.930
<v Speaker 1>know about technology's role is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

744
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's mills all baffled by it for marks</v>

745
00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:27.841
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

746
00:35:27.841 --> 00:35:28.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

747
00:35:28.111 --> 00:35:29.400
<v Speaker 1>it's doing its job perfectly.</v>

748
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Or is that not true of bureaucracy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of control for someone?</v>

749
00:35:33.391 --> 00:35:36.120
<v Speaker 1>This system for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some groups I'm institution,</v>

750
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 1>this system is brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is working 100% effectively.</v>

751
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.730
<v Speaker 1>We have all about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

752
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Whereby alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>

753
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.701
<v Speaker 1>riots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

754
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best summation.</v>

755
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.153
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who is this strata for whom this </v>

756
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 1>system is beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are they?</v>

757
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 1>How do we influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

758
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 1>diminish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit oppose them.</v>

759
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Phd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you got to do.</v>

760
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.320
<v Speaker 2>So she could have sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

761
00:36:05.321 --> 00:36:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could give some preliminary </v>
<v Speaker 2>salary answers to those questions.</v>

762
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an it's,</v>

764
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're in a great position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that sort of stuff on big time.</v>

765
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean it's very important when </v>

766
00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:24.940
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a phd to be in love with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the no matter you're doing,</v>

767
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause otherwise also brand myself by me,</v>

768
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.903
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine because here's why you </v>

769
00:36:31.631 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 2>should be about in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a,</v>

770
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

771
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.163
<v Speaker 2>who benefits while you can see who who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who extracts wealth from it and how </v>

772
00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.640
<v Speaker 2>wealth goods I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 2>How Jeff Bezos gets his money and now he</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the guy rounds,</v>

774
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and good though on my Amazon.</v>

775
00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:52.570
<v Speaker 2>But they're part of the problem.</v>

776
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay the bloody tax a t bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>Begley controlling everything.</v>

777
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.630
<v Speaker 2>So that would have to go and how Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know elise,</v>

778
00:36:58.631 --> 00:36:59.464
<v Speaker 2>I love monopolies are kind of been set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up so they'd been set up in such a way </v>

779
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:03.551
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

780
00:37:03.551 --> 00:37:04.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually,</v>

781
00:37:04.601 --> 00:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use use a minnow,</v>

782
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 2>definitely awesome at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>value is being extracted from us,</v>

783
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.970
<v Speaker 2>kind of rent is being taken away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

784
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

785
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we've got these,</v>

786
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.190
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these systems now which,</v>

787
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.090
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

788
00:37:22.091 --> 00:37:22.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

789
00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:25.370
<v Speaker 2>and I think particularly in the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>field and so on,</v>

790
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.253
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forms of exploitation and </v>

791
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 2>appropriation are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

792
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:31.570
<v Speaker 2>are becoming and are pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

793
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:32.650
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty chronic.</v>

794
00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:33.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there've been that way for quite a </v>

795
00:37:34.541 --> 00:37:37.120
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me right now,</v>

796
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.000
<v Speaker 2>particularly given the problems that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned earlier,</v>

797
00:37:40.001 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 2>the capitalist running out of places to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go for new things to do,</v>

798
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.980
<v Speaker 2>just geographical a geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

799
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.933
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually it's increasingly relying </v>

800
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:49.301
<v Speaker 2>upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:37:49.301 --> 00:37:50.134
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the production and commodification of </v>

802
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

803
00:37:55.361 --> 00:37:57.440
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the commodification of culture.</v>

804
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.200
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

805
00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:02.020
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want to have a short turnover time</v>

806
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.970
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

807
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.090
<v Speaker 2>then the spectacle is instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed.</v>

808
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.733
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like my grandmother's knives </v>

809
00:38:10.301 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>and forks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't ask 150 years,</v>

810
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 2>this is the Olympic Games or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

811
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:15.643
<v Speaker 2>But it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a big mode of capital </v>

812
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:18.934
<v Speaker 2>accumulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vast amounts of money goes into </v>

813
00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:21.604
<v Speaker 2>rebuilding the infrastructure and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that the construction </v>

814
00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:26.320
<v Speaker 2>interest wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Olympic Games or 10 days,</v>

815
00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:27.154
<v Speaker 2>it's all gone.</v>

816
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 2>And there was an x games that running </v>
<v Speaker 2>track round out pink and,</v>

817
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.371
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

818
00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:34.141
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

819
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

820
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:35.590
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

821
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Biennale</v>

822
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.430
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there now and every city has a bnr.</v>

823
00:38:38.431 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a patient with a cultural,</v>

824
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.833
<v Speaker 1>you know like Venice exhibition or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai exhibition and the and and so </v>

825
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.653
<v Speaker 1>and so you suddenly find though the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole kind of cultural realm is being </v>

826
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 1>used as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of commodification real estate</v>

827
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 1>development kind of a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

828
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

829
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a matrix of commodification.</v>

830
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 1>It's applied to everything and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it's prints,</v>

831
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:05.074
<v Speaker 1>fingerprints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it would have anything that's </v>

832
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 1>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fingers on everything.</v>

833
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Like football being a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How like,</v>

834
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to talk sport,</v>

835
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously I think now owned by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sky and stuff,</v>

836
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.033
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel irony of like what everyone is </v>

837
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 1>talking about all the time is I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>all goes about bloody money.</v>

838
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.083
<v Speaker 1>So goes about money and like the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of like the way that football </v>

839
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>looks now and of course in our players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amber,</v>

840
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the few ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class person as a chance to vent</v>

841
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.500
<v Speaker 1>in any money is to become a world class </v>
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>

842
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my point,</v>

843
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that somehow the essence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the game is surviving.</v>

844
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.123
<v Speaker 1>This process of commodification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the experience is being turned into </v>

845
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:45.514
<v Speaker 1>a product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how even age roots in community is </v>

846
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 1>tribal roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its roots as a congregational activity,</v>

847
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.324
<v Speaker 1>a spice for union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And togetherness is basically layer </v>

848
00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 1>after layer of commerce wrapped around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

849
00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>The players appearing in the adverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>adverse on the shirts.</v>

850
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long before the pitch has adverts on</v>

851
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long,</v>

852
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious say it's creeping through </v>

853
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:07.930
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness.</v>

854
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I think as well is</v>

855
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I did,</v>

856
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I commodify people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

857
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:15.663
<v Speaker 1>I have to uncork I have to consciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstitch my tendency to look at people </v>

858
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:20.021
<v Speaker 1>and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

859
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to give me something?</v>

860
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Can I have sex with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking of this now,</v>

861
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.340
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

862
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.193
<v Speaker 1>I'm married now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I try not to look at people as </v>

863
00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 1>commodities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things,</v>

864
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:31.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the floors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

865
00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:32.824
<v Speaker 1>you talk about on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alienation that people understand </v>

866
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

867
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely expendable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My role is meaningless.</v>

868
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I am only a piece of this machinery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>organic piece of matter in a machine.</v>

869
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.230
<v Speaker 1>But the other side of that is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to look each other as commodities.</v>

870
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 1>That we could lose the diff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lens of humanity.</v>

871
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.210
<v Speaker 1>She said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

872
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>was a central kind of pull up politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

873
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:54.934
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what I want to politics of </v>

874
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.473
<v Speaker 1>decommodification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what's happened over the last </v>

875
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:00.791
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years.</v>

876
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Education has become more and more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity,</v>

877
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but should stop being a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be a free good to everybody.</v>

878
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Health care is a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be a free good to everybody.</v>

879
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.434
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should start a de commodified whole </v>

880
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:15.880
<v Speaker 1>sectors of the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's this socialism.</v>

881
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that socialism,</v>

882
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.813
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a socialist or a project and </v>

883
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:22.520
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should also stop the,</v>

884
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start the commodifying others so that we</v>

885
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:28.270
<v Speaker 1>start to look at others as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of instruments of our own,</v>

886
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

887
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.143
<v Speaker 1>our own activities and trying to exploit</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair economic ideology requires that it </v>

888
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:37.744
<v Speaker 1>does things is sort of biological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological is stimulate limitless </v>

889
00:41:40.391 --> 00:41:42.550
<v Speaker 1>need and desire in order to perpetuate </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

890
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.433
<v Speaker 1>Then here's also colonized the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the lives of the </v>

891
00:41:46.081 --> 00:41:46.914
<v Speaker 1>individuals beyond their economic role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it requires their spiritual role </v>

892
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.040
<v Speaker 1>be beholden</v>

893
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.230
<v Speaker 2>to be the ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

894
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.103
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the decolonization of the </v>

895
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.453
<v Speaker 2>decommodification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the kinds of general food </v>

896
00:41:59.381 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>fields of endeavor which we can start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things on right now.</v>

897
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

898
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:08.330
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't even get the Labor party to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to go really strongly.</v>

899
00:42:08.331 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean abolished student debt for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

900
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 2>There was talk of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's talk of it.</v>

901
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well stop having talk about it.</v>

902
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 2>do the same with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.050
<v Speaker 2>making sure that there's enough money </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into healthcare.</v>

905
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's really a non commodified set and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

906
00:42:26.141 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 2>you get rid of the secondary kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>privatized thing,</v>

907
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 2>which the get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get us out of the conservatives,</v>

908
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:33.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to use that as a way of sort of </v>

909
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 2>chewing away at the National Health </v>
<v Speaker 2>Service so that you're done.</v>

910
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.880
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

912
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:41.381
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

913
00:42:41.381 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are real politics,</v>

914
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:43.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can have short,</v>

915
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:44.803
<v Speaker 2>even in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can imagine sort of a radical </v>

916
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

917
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:48.923
<v Speaker 2>And if people start to think in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>decommodification just over something </v>

918
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 2>like education or health care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can extend it a bit more to</v>

919
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:58.140
<v Speaker 2>housing and then actually the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

920
00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

921
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.381
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

922
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cubans you did by the way.</v>

923
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With a ration book on a ration book </v>

924
00:43:04.841 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 2>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain basic amount of rice and sign,</v>

925
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's not working too well right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

926
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but it was a basic food kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>allocation that everybody had.</v>

927
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.620
<v Speaker 2>So do things like this and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

928
00:43:18.621 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do it,</v>

929
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

930
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.083
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people come out of a cult like </v>

931
00:43:24.131 --> 00:43:24.964
<v Speaker 1>scientology or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to sit him down with someone </v>

932
00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>who goes to all that stuff you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up with is not true when they come</v>

933
00:43:31.841 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 1>back to your mom and dad or whatever he </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

934
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And how are we gonna unstitch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning generation generation deep.</v>

935
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.250
<v Speaker 1>When I like sometimes just to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself feel better,</v>

936
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I really go and talk to the young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

937
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him Ben there he is about my views.</v>

938
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

939
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone now,</v>

940
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:53.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my forties now and I tried to </v>

941
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.233
<v Speaker 1>feel like I'm a person that has access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the young and I feel like I can </v>

942
00:43:56.921 --> 00:44:01.760
<v Speaker 1>affect people is to recognize how light </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are indoctrinated by they want,</v>

943
00:44:01.761 --> 00:44:02.594
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phone don't tell them that they </v>

944
00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 1>don't want the phone because they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

945
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much she learned.</v>

946
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.580
<v Speaker 1>They said they think about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they not?</v>

947
00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:10.414
<v Speaker 1>How could they not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we begin to see this thing you </v>

948
00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:14.190
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing you like most of our marks,</v>

949
00:44:14.191 --> 00:44:17.890
<v Speaker 1>his analysis is these ferocity and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to deconstruct,</v>

950
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.110
<v Speaker 1>critique and reveal essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epiphany,</v>

951
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 1>that revelation of essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revelation of real truth,</v>

952
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.284
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to wade through the </v>

953
00:44:25.901 --> 00:44:29.770
<v Speaker 1>layers of inculcation lacquers their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

954
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I you started at</v>

955
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 2>various in various ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think marks has asked answer to</v>

956
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:36.144
<v Speaker 2>this is first off he says it should </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to try to identify certain kinds </v>

957
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:43.731
<v Speaker 2>of practices which are very simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices over things like you know,</v>

958
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.753
<v Speaker 2>using people who in instrumental ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of relating to them as human </v>

959
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>beings and that that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

960
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.550
<v Speaker 2>these changes can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.683
<v Speaker 2>so the realm of practices is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and that can be all over the </v>

962
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:59.010
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is to start to actually</v>

963
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 2>have a political movement which kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

964
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:03.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to actually create human </v>

965
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:06.534
<v Speaker 2>beings of the sort that we're creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with a kind of neo liberal </v>

966
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:11.050
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

967
00:45:11.051 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 2>and we can do things rather differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get people to read.</v>

968
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean you mentioned Gandy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sometimes read Gandy and get very</v>

969
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:18.474
<v Speaker 2>transformed by it in terms of starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about the world in a different </v>

970
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:21.984
<v Speaker 2>kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an educational process </v>

971
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 2>which then gets embedded in a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

972
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is then starts to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

973
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:29.634
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that political movement can start to </v>

974
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:36.051
<v Speaker 2>have effects by orchestrating new forms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of governance and democracy and the,</v>

975
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:37.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

976
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:39.030
<v Speaker 2>if you look at what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barcelona,</v>

977
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:39.864
<v Speaker 2>you've got a radical mare and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to set up a kind of a new forms </v>

978
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 2>of democratic consultation within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

979
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's only just started a,</v>

980
00:45:51.071 --> 00:45:51.904
<v Speaker 2>they only just started working on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is one of the projects they </v>

981
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

982
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that project comes out of a bunch of</v>

983
00:45:57.691 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 2>people who started to develop a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices on the ground who got together</v>

984
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:02.394
<v Speaker 2>and kind of said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

985
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 2>we need to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are radically different.</v>

986
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:05.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mayor comes out of the </v>

987
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:07.450
<v Speaker 2>anti-foreclosure movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

988
00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 2>she very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very progressive.</v>

989
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 2>When she's got a bit of a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance behind her.</v>

990
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And so new things can be be set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very interesting to me,</v>

991
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:16.254
<v Speaker 2>and I'm interested in urban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a radical males around the </v>

992
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:19.224
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even places like Seattle and Los </v>

993
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Angeles have radical councils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're starting to do things that are</v>

994
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The local level,</v>

995
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 2>just to the local level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

996
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:28.314
<v Speaker 2>this is the way in which this political </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement can't be taught from the top </v>

997
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:33.330
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

998
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all going to get sort of,</v>

999
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:39.330
<v Speaker 2>it's got to develop organically somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with the People's daily lives.</v>

1000
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:40.164
<v Speaker 2>So you're not thinking that that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a degree then the power has to be </v>

1001
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:44.890
<v Speaker 2>closer to people and the yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the essay,</v>

1002
00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.580
<v Speaker 2>the idea of state power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if apparently they never,</v>

1003
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:50.310
<v Speaker 2>lynn is always going to seem somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract.</v>

1004
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1005
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you then,</v>

1006
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:53.281
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1007
00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:54.114
<v Speaker 2>to me it's more a dialectical kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between some sort of </v>

1008
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:59.760
<v Speaker 2>centralized state power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody like who's a mayor of a city</v>

1009
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 2>has a certain kind of centralized power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I rest very much upon,</v>

1010
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>local neighborhood movements.</v>

1011
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:06.923
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens is I was movements try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do certain things and they get </v>

1012
00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:10.374
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need crucial support from an </v>

1013
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:14.790
<v Speaker 2>American do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to develop a new house in</v>

1014
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:15.624
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a non commodity housing </v>

1015
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.473
<v Speaker 2>development of affordable housing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably need the city to help you </v>

1016
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:21.774
<v Speaker 2>acquire the land and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the city helps you acquire the </v>

1017
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:24.984
<v Speaker 2>land and the procedures doing this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So said I relationship of certain kind </v>

1018
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 2>between these different levels</v>

1019
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.113
<v Speaker 1>of shame because you've gotten the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent text messages from John Rogers </v>

1020
00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 1>cause he's talking about some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to buy some house.</v>

1021
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.610
<v Speaker 1>My mate John Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said First Communist,</v>

1022
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:39.463
<v Speaker 1>I've met when I was young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He side fairly my head with thirdly </v>

1023
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.010
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1024
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sent me something recently about some</v>

1025
00:47:45.281 --> 00:47:48.310
<v Speaker 1>campaign where people are trying to buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own life by their own land and,</v>

1026
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.533
<v Speaker 1>and develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think then that what you're </v>

1027
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it curious,</v>

1028
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.983
<v Speaker 1>do you think David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they serve sort of forms of more </v>

1029
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:56.890
<v Speaker 1>localized or at least see wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>government?</v>

1030
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.983
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take with my particular code </v>

1031
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>that that's an indication that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's required is decentralized,</v>

1032
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 1>more decentralized power and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the end of the nation state.</v>

1033
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you sort of look at what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in America and him,</v>

1034
00:48:09.741 --> 00:48:10.574
<v Speaker 1>certain strands of British politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like can you see pipe perhaps a within </v>

1035
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the brexit impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a,</v>

1036
00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:20.050
<v Speaker 1>a certain positivity in that people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to unpick themselves.</v>

1037
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.973
<v Speaker 1>I know there's many reasons for brexit </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiver on some level to a kind of </v>

1038
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 1>decentralization power being closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1039
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:28.960
<v Speaker 1>people having a degree of authority in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own lives.</v>

1040
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 1>But I don't believe in a decentralized </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion as a,</v>

1041
00:48:32.261 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 1>as an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because a,</v>

1042
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:37.410
<v Speaker 1>actually it turns out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best ways you can orchestrate</v>

1043
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 1>centralized control is through </v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralization.</v>

1044
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:40.883
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>

1045
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.820
<v Speaker 1>But you think about it at the market is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very decentralized system.</v>

1046
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And of course this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1047
00:48:45.681 --> 00:48:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually compatible with incredible</v>

1048
00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:51.290
<v Speaker 1>concentrations of political and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1049
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.563
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think decentralization in </v>

1050
00:48:53.991 --> 00:48:54.824
<v Speaker 1>itself is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some level of decent in a </v>

1051
00:48:57.981 --> 00:49:00.230
<v Speaker 1>situation where there's not any </v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralization,</v>

1052
00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:03.290
<v Speaker 1>we'd go for decentralization and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies by its ideology.</v>

1053
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:05.240
<v Speaker 1>There is in the air has such a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandate.</v>

1054
00:49:05.241 --> 00:49:07.580
<v Speaker 1>It's such a simplistic mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extract profit,</v>

1055
00:49:07.581 --> 00:49:08.510
<v Speaker 1>extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

1056
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that itself is right</v>

1057
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 1>geographical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's be like,</v>

1058
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it can't be contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1059
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you and I suppose any attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate,</v>

1060
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national level or local level are always</v>

1061
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:21.934
<v Speaker 1>resisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now another thing is say that for a </v>

1062
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:24.904
<v Speaker 1>moment when you said they're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had a political pie that wasn't </v>

1063
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.620
<v Speaker 1>login overtly committed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.130
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1065
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1066
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.180
<v Speaker 1>some of the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1067
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.183
<v Speaker 1>how do you think in governance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>government such as a nation and it's </v>

1068
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:40.460
<v Speaker 1>such an ideology would survive one we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like after weapon.</v>

1069
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Grace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1070
00:49:43.111 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1071
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.004
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the big issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got these pretty progressive </v>

1072
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.593
<v Speaker 1>movements when they get political power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they find political power is </v>

1073
00:49:51.101 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 1>constrained in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the finances are such that they have</v>

1074
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 1>to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd become just like,</v>

1075
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

1076
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the history of the Labour Party when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they came into power,</v>

1078
00:50:01.111 --> 00:50:04.090
<v Speaker 1>he started to be very much more pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist.</v>

1079
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1080
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.290
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1081
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1082
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:08.014
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole kind of revolutionary impulse </v>

1083
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:12.870
<v Speaker 1>has to be taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1084
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.773
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most seriously and decide a reformist </v>

1085
00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:18.930
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1086
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>should look to create what I would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary reforms,</v>

1087
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>those reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which opened the pathway towards</v>

1088
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 2>further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

1089
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:30.893
<v Speaker 1>what does reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you prioritize the </v>

1090
00:50:33.511 --> 00:50:37.740
<v Speaker 1>establishment of like benevolent state </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions around how often education,</v>

1091
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:38.603
<v Speaker 1>I can see how important that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it not equally important given </v>

1092
00:50:41.551 --> 00:50:45.000
<v Speaker 1>what we've discussed that to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

1093
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 1>draconian regulation of enterprise?</v>

1094
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1095
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against a regulating what a,</v>

1096
00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the capitalist class is doing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much in favor.</v>

1097
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.700
<v Speaker 2>What does that sound like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it did,</v>

1098
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1099
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.700
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1100
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.553
<v Speaker 2>you put strict rules on pollution and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put strict rules on things like </v>

1101
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:08.714
<v Speaker 2>occupational safety and health </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions in factories and the like so </v>

1102
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.260
<v Speaker 2>much regulation around their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually those,</v>

1103
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.193
<v Speaker 2>those</v>

1104
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.260
<v Speaker 1>around pie as well.</v>

1105
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1106
00:51:21.451 --> 00:51:22.031
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1107
00:51:22.031 --> 00:51:22.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1108
00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1109
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't,</v>

1110
00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.880
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of world would it be if Ashley</v>

1111
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.800
<v Speaker 2>sign liker them on drag on a principle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of which was we started out,</v>

1112
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:34.043
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big cooperative that became </v>

1113
00:51:35.141 --> 00:51:37.900
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger and bigger originated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Spain.</v>

1114
00:51:37.901 --> 00:51:38.734
<v Speaker 2>And the rule was that the salary </v>
<v Speaker 2>differential should be no more than one </v>

1115
00:51:41.621 --> 00:51:42.700
<v Speaker 2>to three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1116
00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:43.810
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1117
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently it's gone to one to nine.</v>

1118
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.030
<v Speaker 2>So you see the kind of pressures on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one to three.</v>

1119
00:51:49.031 --> 00:51:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if all corporations had to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the,</v>

1120
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:53.013
<v Speaker 2>under the rule that the writer return to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the corporation should a not </v>

1121
00:51:57.821 --> 00:52:01.690
<v Speaker 2>be more than one to three right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Corporation heads guess,</v>

1122
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean like 300 or 400 times what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average height down it.</v>

1123
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course running millions,</v>

1124
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.510
<v Speaker 2>but you legislate it and so kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1125
00:52:13.511 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the situation and we will be,</v>

1126
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.480
<v Speaker 2>we'll be living in a radically different</v>
<v Speaker 2>world if we,</v>

1127
00:52:18.481 --> 00:52:19.510
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if alcor if,</v>

1128
00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:22.360
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if hey on right now is a scandalous,</v>

1129
00:52:22.361 --> 00:52:23.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have this scandal going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here about how much the heads of a </v>

1130
00:52:27.041 --> 00:52:29.610
<v Speaker 2>university is a paid oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're scandal.</v>

1131
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There any [inaudible] earning huge </v>

1132
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:33.874
<v Speaker 2>amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.870
<v Speaker 2>May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time that cutting,</v>

1134
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:40.150
<v Speaker 2>cutting back on on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a number of faculty,</v>

1135
00:52:40.151 --> 00:52:42.190
<v Speaker 2>they hire you now because yeah.</v>

1136
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.660
<v Speaker 1>It's very seductive isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets loaded in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Become a,</v>

1139
00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:51.630
<v Speaker 1>become a little dry in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult not to get lured in.</v>

1140
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you sort of like,</v>

1141
00:52:53.131 --> 00:52:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I knew it was wrong prior to having</v>

1142
00:52:55.621 --> 00:52:57.930
<v Speaker 1>money and I knew so that it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work as well.</v>

1143
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And then when you said the comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the seduction of comfort.</v>

1144
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I confess I have some of that too.</v>

1145
00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.253
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that is that there's a </v>

1146
00:53:10.901 --> 00:53:14.160
<v Speaker 1>component to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always harp on about whether,</v>

1147
00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to engender real </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

1148
00:53:16.511 --> 00:53:17.344
<v Speaker 1>deep change isn't not through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's through analysis and </v>

1149
00:53:19.841 --> 00:53:22.240
<v Speaker 1>critique because I think people sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1150
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I think they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like uh,</v>

1151
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.000
<v Speaker 1>for to understand that change is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1152
00:53:27.001 --> 00:53:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

1153
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1154
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:31.494
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of the antithesis of the </v>

1155
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 1>alienation that you just described.</v>

1156
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a moment in any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary process with where,</v>

1157
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1158
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.000
<v Speaker 2>If people don't feel differently than</v>

1159
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.770
<v Speaker 1>okay it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1160
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:46.250
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean do you mentioned as well there is</v>

1161
00:53:46.251 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 1>the possibility for mass communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are some seats.</v>

1162
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.823
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was trying to do </v>

1163
00:53:51.591 --> 00:53:52.424
<v Speaker 1>when I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was more overly involved in </v>

1164
00:53:53.571 --> 00:53:56.990
<v Speaker 1>political conversation is I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find grand stand flash,</v>

1165
00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:57.950
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blatant,</v>

1166
00:53:57.951 --> 00:53:59.810
<v Speaker 1>bland things that people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1167
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1168
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:03.830
<v Speaker 1>and the one things you that group </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter ad busters.</v>

1169
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:04.883
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would sort of say things like </v>

1170
00:54:05.781 --> 00:54:06.614
<v Speaker 1>Cuellar Corporation and is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it made me sort of </v>

1171
00:54:08.601 --> 00:54:09.434
<v Speaker 1>tingle with excitement is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say identify a corporation there </v>

1172
00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:13.244
<v Speaker 1>is not popular dumb a campaign lips of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like when we campaigning for </v>

1173
00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.000
<v Speaker 1>hospitals or on behalf of unions it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>

1174
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it exists within a million that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to manage.</v>

1175
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like a target campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like our role is we are going to</v>

1176
00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:28.910
<v Speaker 1>crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>

1177
00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.350
<v Speaker 1>undermine dissemble apple was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult one because we've all got them</v>

1178
00:54:33.351 --> 00:54:34.760
<v Speaker 1>and they're so bloody popular.</v>

1179
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.220
<v Speaker 1>We've all got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were all tacked up in it.</v>

1180
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like get it.</v>

1181
00:54:38.721 --> 00:54:39.554
<v Speaker 1>Do you see like that there could be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the these ideas or is there any </v>

1182
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:42.944
<v Speaker 1>potential for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to introduce these kinds of </v>

1183
00:54:44.361 --> 00:54:45.194
<v Speaker 1>ideas are like in it cause it's hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to look at Google and Amazon with </v>

1184
00:54:48.501 --> 00:54:51.950
<v Speaker 1>animosity or you know like even though I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know why don't they pay their taxes?</v>

1185
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Why won't you know it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I like those logos,</v>

1186
00:54:54.261 --> 00:54:56.180
<v Speaker 1>those brands and those stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>convenience,</v>

1187
00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:57.800
<v Speaker 1>the comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so seductive.</v>

1188
00:54:57.801 --> 00:54:59.060
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like people went,</v>

1190
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.080
<v Speaker 1>like when I talked to black cab drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.400
<v Speaker 1>One of the few ways that working people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have an on his job and then like,</v>

1194
00:55:07.401 --> 00:55:08.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>

1195
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.540
<v Speaker 1>so creepingly convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1196
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you ask people,</v>

1197
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you get people to change the</v>

1198
00:55:15.351 --> 00:55:19.790
<v Speaker 1>way they see the world without some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different vehicle into their hearts?</v>

1199
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can</v>

1200
00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:22.690
<v Speaker 2>boycott is better or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1201
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be an interesting way.</v>

1202
00:55:25.601 --> 00:55:28.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did get boycott in New York City.</v>

1203
00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:30.973
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a day when a trump declared the </v>

1205
00:55:33.461 --> 00:55:36.490
<v Speaker 2>no Muslims are allowed from those </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and they'll,</v>

1206
00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.340
<v Speaker 2>everybody's rushing out to the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport to sort of,</v>

1207
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:40.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers and all this kind of stuff for </v>

1208
00:55:41.181 --> 00:55:43.270
<v Speaker 2>turning up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1209
00:55:43.271 --> 00:55:45.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regular cab drivers,</v>

1210
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went on strike for an hour.</v>

1211
00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So I actually arrived at Kennedy airport</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1212
00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:51.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1213
00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 2>all this was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was impossible to get out because like</v>

1214
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>the cab drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Uber broke the strike and Aruba came</v>

1215
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.670
<v Speaker 2>in the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1216
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:01.803
<v Speaker 2>social media was of out of says boycott </v>
<v Speaker 2>uber next day Uber lost half its </v>

1217
00:56:05.381 --> 00:56:08.260
<v Speaker 2>passengers because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

1218
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:11.170
<v Speaker 2>cause I undermined the cab drivers </v>
<v Speaker 2>striker,</v>

1219
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the immigrant population.</v>

1220
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.420
<v Speaker 2>And I thought it was very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1221
00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:17.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

1222
00:56:17.621 --> 00:56:20.440
<v Speaker 2>So there is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to go with it.</v>

1223
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>So the communities with their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrate</v>

1224
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.993
<v Speaker 2>these points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes these symbolic things </v>

1225
00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 2>are very important and that I am all in </v>
<v Speaker 2>favor of,</v>

1226
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of symbolic action.</v>

1227
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the occupy movement was a </v>

1228
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:33.904
<v Speaker 2>symbolic movement and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually changed the discourse about </v>

1229
00:56:36.581 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1230
00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.650
<v Speaker 2>introduced the concept of the 1% and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody I was down at.</v>

1231
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.553
<v Speaker 2>And so we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were in the occupy </v>

1232
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 2>movement and so it was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible failure.</v>

1233
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:48.551
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1234
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:49.384
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it did some things which were </v>

1235
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:54.170
<v Speaker 2>terribly important too soon to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

1236
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.023
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1237
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may I run through like a,</v>

1238
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.123
<v Speaker 2>the proper questions myself and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that we've covered everything </v>

1239
00:57:00.401 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 2>because you're so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1240
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it too,</v>

1241
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:04.384
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1242
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

1243
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:06.403
<v Speaker 2>we love Pricer Marx's capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most important text in the </v>

1244
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:12.550
<v Speaker 2>modern era changed the destiny of </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries' politics.</v>

1245
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 2>People across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are its key arguments?</v>

1246
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.530
<v Speaker 2>We better pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that we carry a pair,</v>

1247
00:57:17.531 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 2>but you think we've covered that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I think we all have and that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

1249
00:57:20.831 --> 00:57:23.870
<v Speaker 2>about commodification is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulation of capital,</v>

1250
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.713
<v Speaker 2>circulation of capital and how it has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow and technological change and </v>

1251
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 2>dynamism and all of that understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1252
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.823
<v Speaker 2>Do his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas if that's capital of capsule </v>

1253
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 2>continue to resonate today and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they still offer?</v>

1254
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we talked about that too because </v>

1255
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:40.900
<v Speaker 2>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1256
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 2>capital is more prevalent around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world now and it was back then.</v>

1257
00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:45.454
<v Speaker 2>So in some ways marks is more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because the terrain on which it </v>

1258
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:51.030
<v Speaker 2>operates is much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That socialism,</v>

1259
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communism definitely done that.</v>

1260
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Considering the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological,</v>

1261
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 2>economic and industrial changes occurred</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last hundred and 50 years,</v>

1262
00:57:57.881 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 2>how might marks his analysis and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>application need to be modified.</v>

1263
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 2>You want to do it a little bit more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1264
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that the answer to it is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1265
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very accurate.</v>

1266
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1267
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1268
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:16.324
<v Speaker 2>Marx wrote a lot about what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19th century and that's dated </v>

1269
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.693
<v Speaker 2>what he's writing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's writing about capital is </v>

1270
00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:23.050
<v Speaker 2>writing about a system which still </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>

1271
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 2>which is even more powerful now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't his day,</v>

1272
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:29.150
<v Speaker 2>so possibly we can now see how it's laid</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1273
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.780
<v Speaker 2>We got bloody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1274
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.170
<v Speaker 2>he said that was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some aspects,</v>

1275
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:32.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1276
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.590
<v Speaker 2>the marks never got around to finishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing on,</v>

1277
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finance and the role of finance where he</v>

1278
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 2>read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote some very fascinating stuff,</v>

1279
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but he never completed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we need to do that right now because</v>

1280
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 2>the financial question is a much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>question now than it was in his day.</v>

1281
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.513
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1282
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Your work is said to be appreciated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anna Case and the outcome and the occupy</v>

1283
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 2>movement as much as it is by Linden is </v>
<v Speaker 2>party organizers.</v>

1284
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you think miss is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea and you should ask them.</v>

1285
00:58:58.810 --> 00:58:59.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1286
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Well done with not being vain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should've put that question in their</v>

1287
00:59:01.951 --> 00:59:05.230
<v Speaker 2>cow that makes us look sycophantic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross that out.</v>

1288
00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the shadow.</v>

1289
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.343
<v Speaker 2>It makes us look how authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has your anthropological and </v>

1290
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 2>geographical background informed your </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching of marks?</v>

1291
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:14.020
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to know that it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1293
00:59:16.171 --> 00:59:17.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1294
00:59:17.731 --> 00:59:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call a different take on mark's taught</v>

1295
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:24.230
<v Speaker 2>our people and the is a m prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not primarily interested in mark's.</v>

1296
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm primarily interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>urbanization,</v>

1297
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.760
<v Speaker 2>uneven geographical development at world</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>

1298
00:59:29.761 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 2>a local scale and things of that kind.</v>

1299
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:32.790
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1300
00:59:32.791 --> 00:59:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I like about marks is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps me understand all of that.</v>

1301
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:36.883
<v Speaker 2>Now when there's somebody in marks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help me understand or that I </v>

1302
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:40.540
<v Speaker 2>kind of push it to one side and say kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1303
00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably a useless bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of marks.</v>

1304
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 2>My religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much about,</v>

1305
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:46.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much about mark's a as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a practical guide rather than as a </v>

1306
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 2>grand theory Tisha and who's a pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory got fest.</v>

1307
00:59:53.781 --> 00:59:54.614
<v Speaker 2>And so I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't because you come from different </v>

1308
00:59:56.361 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 2>disciplines in anthropology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>geography are right now.</v>

1309
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 2>And thank God I'm not an economist.</v>

1310
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's boring isn't it?</v>

1311
01:00:02.041 --> 01:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's a made up and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and he's all just pretend.</v>

1312
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Now what about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1313
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I like that breakfast thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1314
01:00:10.141 --> 01:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>where's your breakfast come from as good</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it?</v>

1315
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you said no,</v>

1316
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.873
<v Speaker 1>these beans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably been prevail and like </v>

1317
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:17.091
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cold,</v>

1318
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all sorts has gone on.</v>

1319
01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Put your fit mind the cocoa pop where to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar come from?</v>

1320
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Titan Lyle,</v>

1321
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>that capital of Rab scallions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When trust as far as I could from,</v>

1322
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I still got the whip marks in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1323
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been said,</v>

1324
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>we are entering a post capitalist era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we still live in the country side?</v>

1325
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>How can I say one just after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we do.</v>

1326
01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:37.644
<v Speaker 1>It's got worse than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always something that's worse than </v>

1327
01:00:38.851 --> 01:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some sort of terrible,</v>

1328
01:00:40.981 --> 01:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>terrible behemoth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sidewalks.</v>

1329
01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm horrible monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always pretty horrible monster size,</v>

1330
01:00:45.401 --> 01:00:46.234
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a monster that has some good </v>

1331
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes beyonce,</v>

1332
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quickbase complying with beyonce.</v>

1333
01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Will the current system ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>proved to be fatal to us?</v>

1334
01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.753
<v Speaker 1>I wish</v>

1335
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.733
<v Speaker 2>could say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the trouble is the capital can </v>

1336
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:05.510
<v Speaker 2>continue under the most dire conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>if people don't change it.</v>

1337
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.373
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point that people who have </v>

1338
01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:07.734
<v Speaker 2>got to change it because I ain't going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change because I ain't going to </v>

1339
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 2>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resounded Gourd.</v>

1340
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to change.</v>

1341
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.633
<v Speaker 1>What are some of the main contradictions</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the heart cath is we really covered </v>

1342
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>that with the growth and the dynamism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garraffa car believed that they could go</v>

1343
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>after the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does all of these.</v>

1344
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>The producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been reading it very hard.</v>

1345
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Could you ever love me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kara?</v>

1346
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>

1347
01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:24.993
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the argument that says </v>

1348
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>capitalism's contradictions lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations?</v>

1349
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>They may do it resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1350
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you get that from?</v>

1351
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1352
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:34.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1353
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.623
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of reinvention going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on at the capitalism and it's very </v>

1354
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very useful.</v>

1355
01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:39.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we do without velcro and </v>

1356
01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:41.484
<v Speaker 2>things like that?</v>

1357
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>No crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see an example.</v>

1358
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It's trivial things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

1359
01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>if you're struggling and you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken arm and you need to fix it up and</v>

1360
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>he'd wear Velcro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy is it good?</v>

1361
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.593
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said my stuff wanting to cut over </v>

1362
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given this entire interview,</v>

1363
01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you write about how cities are both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of capitol and class struggles are</v>

1364
01:02:02.341 --> 01:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>cs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rubber has cities of both capital.</v>

1365
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>He write about how cities are the half </v>
<v Speaker 1>both capital and class struggles.</v>

1366
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:10.283
<v Speaker 1>How am I cities be reorganized in Moss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually just an ecologically saying </v>

1367
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of</v>

1368
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.790
<v Speaker 2>the big projects I think though we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to have is how to redesign cities so</v>

1369
01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:19.890
<v Speaker 2>that they're much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1370
01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>available to the population where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>count the island nations,</v>

1371
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 2>which currently exists to bound urban </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1372
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>And actually it's interesting if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it over the last 30 years,</v>

1373
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>most of the big movements gone around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world have been urban movements.</v>

1374
01:02:35.241 --> 01:02:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And I gazey park about what happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Brazil,</v>

1375
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:39.804
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1376
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>

1377
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:46.560
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even occupy was a much from a lot of</v>

1379
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:47.394
<v Speaker 2>it was about housing and urban questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not about what's going on in the </v>

1380
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:52.074
<v Speaker 2>factory.</v>

1381
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1382
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that means.</v>

1383
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.053
<v Speaker 2>It means that actually the people are as</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about the qualities of urban </v>

1384
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.480
<v Speaker 2>urban life as they are about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualities of a,</v>

1385
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>their employment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1386
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 2>They've always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always been involved in both,</v>

1387
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that marks was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of bias towards is he biased towards</v>

1388
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>production and not necessarily because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the timing is right.</v>

1389
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1390
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 2>so I would always want to correct that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have it in March</v>

1391
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.083
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now the kind of economies in </v>

1392
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.094
<v Speaker 1>which these movements were occurring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no longer sort of mass </v>

1393
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>production in a manner in which there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was men.</v>

1394
01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.453
<v Speaker 1>Marx was writing now,</v>

1395
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.700
<v Speaker 2>okay multiverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many parts of the world,</v>

1396
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>the working class in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>factory libraries,</v>

1397
01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.123
<v Speaker 2>there's disappeared as being central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not in China or Bangladesh </v>

1398
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:42.540
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1399
01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 2>in North America traditional working </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

1400
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's been much diminished.</v>

1401
01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He separately say Paul Gilbert was,</v>

1402
01:03:48.561 --> 01:03:49.331
<v Speaker 1>he pulled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1403
01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:52.370
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land yard of land,</v>

1404
01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>yard class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the needs of working class.</v>

1405
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting thing we had when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing interviews,</v>

1406
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.603
<v Speaker 1>sounds of dance capital capital's we now</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it of course now that d and making </v>

1407
01:04:02.031 --> 01:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>that kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1408
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:07.760
<v Speaker 1>curly curly have sought sensitive as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight crash is Marxism on the rise.</v>

1409
01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a much greater interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>

1410
01:04:10.361 --> 01:04:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1411
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:12.923
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] idea was in the 1990s </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was very hard to get anybody to </v>

1412
01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>have a look at Alex's capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

1413
01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since 2000,</v>

1414
01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gradually come important.</v>

1415
01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>And then the crisis of 2007 2008 yeah.</v>

1416
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.053
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these big arguments against </v>

1417
01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:30.824
<v Speaker 1>communism in the 20th century has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly responsible for killing 100 </v>

1418
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.970
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it?</v>

1419
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:36.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has a lot of things that can be </v>

1420
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.330
<v Speaker 2>very negative things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1421
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:43.620
<v Speaker 2>religion in and of course mal made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge mistake,</v>

1422
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:48.830
<v Speaker 2>which led to the great famine in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About 20 million people died focus,</v>

1423
01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:50.611
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1424
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also saved a lot of lives.</v>

1425
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:53.544
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing about even about </v>

1426
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:55.494
<v Speaker 2>the China case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people get mad at me when I say </v>

1427
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:57.241
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1428
01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:58.074
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 million people probably died in the </v>

1429
01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:00.114
<v Speaker 2>famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was unnecessary bad policies and </v>

1430
01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:02.724
<v Speaker 2>all that stood on the other hand where </v>
<v Speaker 2>mal came to power life expectancy in </v>

1431
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:06.894
<v Speaker 2>China was 35 and when he died and life </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectancy was 65 so he did something </v>

1432
01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:12.120
<v Speaker 2>right as well as,</v>

1433
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1434
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:14.023
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it's your personal role to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address much of the propagandized </v>

1435
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.960
<v Speaker 1>information was taken as</v>

1436
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.083
<v Speaker 2>another photo of the public eye on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It emphasizes all the negatives and it </v>

1437
01:05:22.471 --> 01:05:24.550
<v Speaker 2>never says anything about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positives were.</v>

1438
01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Balanced propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1439
01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I understand one capitalist economies </v>
<v Speaker 1>are based on free exchange.</v>

1440
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>This is a popular claim of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

1441
01:05:36.761 --> 01:05:37.594
<v Speaker 1>Is it made up?</v>

1442
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Well in principle it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in practice a lot of it is monopoly,</v>

1443
01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:43.400
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1444
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.010
<v Speaker 1>monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power plus even people's and the role of</v>

1445
01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:49.160
<v Speaker 1>the consumer and they've been stimulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a terrible state of desperation.</v>

1446
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've covered it.</v>

1447
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I think this is such a thorough </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview I've done now.</v>

1448
01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:55.910
<v Speaker 1>It kinda just before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not,</v>

1449
01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>not that we let you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your continued to be free,</v>

1450
01:05:58.281 --> 01:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>but my mate John Rogers sent me this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1451
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>check out this and see if it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1452
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blah blah blah.</v>

1453
01:06:04.071 --> 01:06:04.904
<v Speaker 1>I meet out in Malin you in respect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this project we are hoping you could </v>

1454
01:06:07.821 --> 01:06:08.654
<v Speaker 1>speak to Russel about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Russell and probably close to his </v>

1455
01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:11.534
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a number of people in Harringay </v>

1456
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:13.243
<v Speaker 1>have formed a company with the aim of </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying a large bit of land that would </v>

1457
01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be sold to a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>developer.</v>

1458
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:19.183
<v Speaker 1>They will want to build loads of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive housing and a part of </v>

1459
01:06:20.871 --> 01:06:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Harringay Tottenham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just as call it north London,</v>

1460
01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not antagonize.</v>

1461
01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:25.903
<v Speaker 1>Most of the other people in London where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a big football insights were </v>

1462
01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:30.524
<v Speaker 1>local people can't afford them lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentrifying the area and kicking out </v>

1463
01:06:32.631 --> 01:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>local people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we want to do is build 800 times.</v>

1464
01:06:34.641 --> 01:06:35.474
<v Speaker 1>They're all genuinely affordable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>local people and the site controlled by </v>

1465
01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>local people or low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on,</v>

1466
01:06:40.851 --> 01:06:41.684
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you need more info you can go to </v>

1467
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.230
<v Speaker 1>the websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start hiring guide or Co.</v>

1468
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:47.721
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>

1469
01:06:47.721 --> 01:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>We are actually serious about this as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny paragraph to put this late in.</v>

1470
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got,</v>

1471
01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>we've got solicitors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architects,</v>

1472
01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>we've been speaking to the mayor about </v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah blah.</v>

1473
01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>We need to pry pile on pressure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicity.</v>

1474
01:06:58.961 --> 01:06:59.794
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about project like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where essentially I suppose their </v>

1475
01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:02.534
<v Speaker 1>project is to have sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to acquire some land to build 800 times </v>

1476
01:07:07.581 --> 01:07:09.050
<v Speaker 1>and sort of govern them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1477
01:07:09.051 --> 01:07:09.884
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be operating within like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolis that's got other systems of </v>

1478
01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>government aid his heart.</v>

1479
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1480
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to know more details.</v>

1481
01:07:16.361 --> 01:07:21.361
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't just make snap judgments </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a [inaudible] support,</v>

1482
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1483
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Speaker 2>in the states we have something called </v>
<v Speaker 2>community land trust,</v>

1484
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 2>which takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that people who are in those</v>

1485
01:07:30.461 --> 01:07:31.294
<v Speaker 2>houses can't sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know whether that's in that </v>

1486
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>proposal where the people are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier,</v>

1487
01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>they can't turn a quick profit on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>host.</v>

1488
01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1489
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:39.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1490
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people come in and they live there,</v>

1491
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 2>then if I leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they just get back what they put in</v>

1492
01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:44.854
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no kind of speculation on the </v>

1493
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.490
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anything of that sort.</v>

1494
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm in five fiverr off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1495
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.593
<v Speaker 2>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people have authority and power in </v>

1496
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:54.130
<v Speaker 2>their own lives and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>govern themselves with possible.</v>

1497
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:54.964
<v Speaker 2>But if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we sometimes find in those things </v>

1498
01:07:57.401 --> 01:07:59.140
<v Speaker 2>where people look at the situation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1499
01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the rules of the game,</v>

1500
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't sell and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I could sell,</v>

1501
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:03.514
<v Speaker 2>I could make mega bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So therefore individuals tried to then </v>

1502
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 2>turn those collective things into things</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can speculate and come out.</v>

1503
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1504
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:12.123
<v Speaker 1>isn't it cause in a way capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most and observable phenomena as </v>

1505
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>somehow sourced from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our inner lives of fear,</v>

1506
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>greed.</v>

1507
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly that,</v>

1508
01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1509
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:24.524
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody is living there and I see </v>

1510
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:26.624
<v Speaker 2>that if they could make this better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn this back into a market </v>

1511
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:29.803
<v Speaker 2>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could make a lot of money out of </v>

1512
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:31.754
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1513
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they got pressing needs,</v>

1514
01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:34.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical needs or something like that or </v>

1515
01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 2>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1516
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:40.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to go market.</v>

1517
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:41.111
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1518
01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:41.881
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1519
01:08:41.881 --> 01:08:42.714
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1520
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>greed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1521
01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an ideology and so on.</v>

1522
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>People have real kind of needs.</v>

1523
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's why you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1524
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:51.044
<v Speaker 1>I insistent on there being some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>state roles so that there is some sort </v>

1525
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.214
<v Speaker 1>of overarching principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So legal apparatus there that prevents </v>

1526
01:08:58.881 --> 01:08:59.714
<v Speaker 1>them selling out at a market rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some free advice from David </v>

1527
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Harvey that you've got there from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1528
01:09:04.451 --> 01:09:06.350
<v Speaker 1>there are some called Tony [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of my mate,</v>

1529
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:10.370
<v Speaker 1>John Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally what five books we've got to</v>

1530
01:09:10.371 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible,</v>

1531
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1532
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1533
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you should get an reading this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>from any,</v>

1534
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.340
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1535
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.233
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sorts of things I would so say </v>

1536
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.340
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1537
01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read a clr james on a black </v>

1538
01:09:28.981 --> 01:09:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Jacobins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1539
01:09:30.211 --> 01:09:34.830
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a common understanding.</v>

1540
01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's an understanding of marks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from,</v>

1541
01:09:36.901 --> 01:09:39.420
<v Speaker 2>from the colonial experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it that way.</v>

1542
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:43.440
<v Speaker 2>And so anybody is coming from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>background I think would immediately get</v>

1543
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.303
<v Speaker 2>sucked into sort of appreciating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marks is standpoint from that </v>

1544
01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:48.804
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say the same thing about something </v>

1545
01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Sunday like Silvia Federici who has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book on Kaliban and the witch and,</v>

1546
01:09:56.311 --> 01:09:57.144
<v Speaker 2>and another more recent one called 0.0,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about the experience of women </v>

1547
01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.373
<v Speaker 2>and the whole history of capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulation from the very origins to </v>

1548
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.360
<v Speaker 2>two today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1549
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:07.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who will get into that and I </v>

1550
01:10:09.481 --> 01:10:11.680
<v Speaker 2>would get a person and perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the marks,</v>

1551
01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>his position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would come from,</v>

1552
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:14.423
<v Speaker 2>from that.</v>

1553
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.490
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.520
<v Speaker 2>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a humanist position,</v>

1555
01:10:17.521 --> 01:10:20.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd say read Terry Eagleton spoke on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1556
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.610
<v Speaker 2>why Marx was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1557
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>wear marks where he actually goes over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole history of,</v>

1558
01:10:26.281 --> 01:10:27.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1559
01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.133
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Marxists humanists positions that he </v>

1560
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:30.714
<v Speaker 2>took on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he was right and corrects a lot of </v>

1561
01:10:33.481 --> 01:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>the bad propaganda that we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1562
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And then I leave for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>

1563
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>then I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'd say,</v>

1564
01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:41.100
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you a couple of mine.</v>

1565
01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should take a this last one,</v>

1566
01:10:44.161 --> 01:10:46.230
<v Speaker 2>which is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1567
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:49.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marx capital and the madness of economic</v>

1568
01:10:49.081 --> 01:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

1569
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.620
<v Speaker 2>but then I will it by reading the brief </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of neoliberalism,</v>

1570
01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:59.040
<v Speaker 2>which is about the history of capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulation from an 1970s onwards,</v>

1571
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.850
<v Speaker 2>but it got out to about 2005 so it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the crisis,</v>

1572
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:08.240
<v Speaker 2>whereas the new book has a final chapter</v>
<v Speaker 2>which updates the neo liberalism.</v>

1573
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Bocomez happens in neoliberalism since </v>
<v Speaker 2>2005 so I would say,</v>

1574
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get into get into things that </v>

<v Speaker 2>You read in this monologue from </v>

1582
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare that you've concluded that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>right out of King John.</v>

1583

1584
01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:37.674

<v Speaker 2>this commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this board,</v>
