<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is a professor of English at </v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:03.204
<v Speaker 1>Warwick University and writes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance in its social and political </v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His book,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>women as hamlet include studies of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting relationship of Shakespeare,</v>

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>culture and gender in many societies an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological situations.</v>

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.753
<v Speaker 1>His work includes leading the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multicultural Shakespeare project which </v>

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>focuses on the relationship between race</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Shakespeare in modern Britain and on</v>

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the achievement of black and Asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists working on the place.</v>

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've worked together before,</v>

11
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:34.284
<v Speaker 1>of course on a a week at the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater where we took various </v>

12
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare monologues and I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>use them to tell a psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biographical story,</v>

14
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:44.694
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically an autobiographical story </v>

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>using the works of Shakespeare to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my own life.</v>

16
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:49.884
<v Speaker 1>I was struck that in preparation for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this week of rehearsal and </v>

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.283
<v Speaker 1>workshopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you re-read Shakespeare in its entirety </v>

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.363
<v Speaker 1>that's doing more work in preparation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that one event on Shakespeare than </v>

19
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever done while I am paid to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing as a university professor.</v>

20
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was no great hardship for you.</v>

21
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Did you discover anything on and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rereading of the works of Shakespeare?</v>

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you discover anything new?</v>

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.743
<v Speaker 2>What I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I did it was because I </v>

24
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:24.441
<v Speaker 2>knew that you were making a project </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Shakespeare and I'd been given the</v>

25
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 2>headlines that you were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Shakespeare might have to say about</v>

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 2>parenting and about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I instantly said,</v>

27
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:34.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

28
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.664
<v Speaker 2>parenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect because Shakespeare in </v>

29
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 2>almost all of his plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 2>is showing you how not to be apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 2>you can be a king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

32
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 2>you could be a peasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

33
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.423
<v Speaker 2>you will completely try to screw up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>child and you'll have huge success at </v>

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was no problem.</v>

35
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.573
<v Speaker 2>But addiction I found more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it didn't instantly jump out to </v>

36
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 2>me that Shakespeare writes about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I sort of had a had conceived as </v>

38
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 2>being a drug addiction or addiction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tobacco or something like that.</v>

39
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.203
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to read through a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of texts and in order to try and find </v>

40
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>out where that connection might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.843
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing more enjoyable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning through the complete works of </v>

42
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a great privilege</v>

43
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>when you looked at addiction as </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogist to obsession.</v>

44
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.123
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That then surely it becomes completely </v>

45
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>different reading.</v>

46
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

47
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Because it took me some time to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that connection.</v>

48
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a huge amount in </v>

49
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 2>shakespeare about obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you don't mind if I sort of </v>

51
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 2>pepper this conversation with references</v>
<v Speaker 2>to particular plays or performances,</v>

52
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>difficult if we forbid it luminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on Shakespeare,</v>

53
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:51.524
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare relevant as to modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences and how Shakespeare reflects </v>

54
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>the relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

55
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>cultural relationships as they evolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and develop.</v>

56
00:02:58.191 --> 00:02:59.024
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm fascinated by in particular is </v>

57
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the way that you've studied how </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare relates to race,</v>

58
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:03.874
<v Speaker 1>how shakespeare relates to gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems to me that you see the </v>

59
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>work of Shakespeare as some sort of uber</v>
<v Speaker 1>template for the human condition.</v>

60
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.353
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please don't mention the place and </v>

61
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>trying encourage to give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>

62
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about Richard the third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a figure who is the kind of the</v>

64
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.383
<v Speaker 2>dark shadow inside all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His only compulsion is to achieve power </v>

65
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and to humiliate as many human beings in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process as he can.</v>

66
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.633
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way shakespeare kind of shows </v>

67
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 2>that is to give him at the start of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

68
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pure wet through certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

69
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.853
<v Speaker 2>So what he does is he comes up to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman called lady whose husband he's </v>

70
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:59.841
<v Speaker 2>murdered and he woos her over a coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the beginning of that she is full</v>

71
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 2>of anger and hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the end of it,</v>

72
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.523
<v Speaker 2>he's been successful in reducing her and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of showing off what willpower </v>

73
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 2>can actually achieve if it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused.</v>

74
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.143
<v Speaker 2>So as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that he is going to be very </v>

75
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to achieve anything.</v>

76
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>He wants his damn but over a dozen </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies at least.</v>

77
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.903
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he then Shakespeare then shocks us by </v>

78
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 2>having him stamp over the bodies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>children because we can all say,</v>

79
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:31.404
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're kind of empathize with the </v>

80
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>trickster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jester,</v>

81
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 2>even the devilish character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know that he's acting out sort of</v>

82
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.100
<v Speaker 2>terrible impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we feel,</v>

83
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>and we get to kind of have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.190
<v Speaker 2>an ejection of pleasure from feeling we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can criticize it,</v>

85
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>but we're also along there with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to killing children,</v>

86
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>which happens several times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare,</v>

87
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.300
<v Speaker 2>it's wrenching your guts and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>forced to decide how far I'm going to go</v>

88
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:00.564
<v Speaker 2>along with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's very interesting is that then we </v>

89
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>find out that obsession isn't just about</v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

90
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.990
<v Speaker 2>It's about self entrapment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

91
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 2>So at the end of the play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard,</v>

92
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:13.374
<v Speaker 2>the third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is now the king and has to replay </v>

93
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that seduction scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

94
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.533
<v Speaker 2>There's another woman who is the queen </v>
<v Speaker 2>of England and she's got a daughter who </v>

95
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 2>he wants to marry him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he has to go through the same thing.</v>

96
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 2>He says the same words has the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactions,</v>

97
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.763
<v Speaker 2>but this time he doesn't get the success</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants so that I think that's an </v>

98
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:32.934
<v Speaker 2>example of the way that human behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>is taken into areas that we don't </v>

99
00:05:38.191 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 2>normally experienced by Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sooner or later will find that there</v>

100
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:47.430
<v Speaker 2>are limits and we're trapped by who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and even if you set out to break all</v>

101
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.264
<v Speaker 2>the rules and to break every taboo to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>obscene and you're going to destroy </v>

102
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 2>yourself in the process and it will be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very undramatic process.</v>

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 1>It seems from listening to Tony that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare is necessarily dealing in </v>

104
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.800
<v Speaker 1>archetypes and energies that are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>present in human psyche.</v>

105
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.964
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's an obvious point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make because otherwise Shakespeare </v>

106
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have been relevant at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was writing or relevant.</v>

107
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Now when you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it's come up,</v>

108
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.663
<v Speaker 1>a character like Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third who the archetype of the </v>

109
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.174
<v Speaker 1>tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of a damaged malcontent and </v>

110
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.340
<v Speaker 1>that for me that seems like an emblem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a figure that is relevant now.</v>

111
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that this is a fractured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disrupted time.</v>

112
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been like that.</v>

113
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's an observation people </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually make.</v>

114
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.113
<v Speaker 1>I'm referring of course specifically to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Donald Trump brexit times of </v>

115
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>malevolence severance and wrap chop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

116
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>when you're relate into the contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

117
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>use Shakespeare the same way that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>might look at a religious texts like the</v>

118
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Bible or Koran or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my God,</v>

119
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>these ideas are explored here because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is talking about the totality of a human</v>

120
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>being and all situations ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed through the human psyche.</v>

121
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a waiver.</v>

122
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

123
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

124
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think Shakespeare has </v>
<v Speaker 2>become.</v>

125
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Speaker 2>every country perhaps has a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortext that's really important to it.</v>

127
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in many cases that will be a </v>

128
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 2>religious text or philosophical text or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a political creed.</v>

129
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.963
<v Speaker 2>I think in many ways Shakespeare has </v>
<v Speaker 2>become that for us and potentially for </v>

130
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Speaker 2>the English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may offer it all English people.</v>

131
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for English culture at its best,</v>

132
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.220
<v Speaker 2>a shakespeare shows you how to live your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

133
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 2>which is that there is no dogma in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare.</v>

134
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

135
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.773
<v Speaker 2>some of his plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the toilets with that for a </v>

136
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:01.054
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an evil man and he's overthrown at </v>

137
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:04.234
<v Speaker 2>the end by the first of the Tudor on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Shakespeare is writing Chou Dynasty </v>

138
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>so you can see it as propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually the moment you start </v>

140
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 2>listening to the words that the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judah kings speaks,</v>

141
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>you begin to doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky I think to have such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal dramatic text at the heart of</v>

143
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:33.211
<v Speaker 2>our culture because that means that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer is not imposing a perspective.</v>

144
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 2>His job is to be as complete and diverse</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you possibly can.</v>

145
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.913
<v Speaker 2>I suppose because he's function is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a story rather than to impose an </v>

146
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:48.574
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is always a corollary between </v>

147
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:52.590
<v Speaker 2>story</v>

148
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>and character and between character </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence.</v>

149
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we spoke before you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Tempesta is in many ways the,</v>

150
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:03.114
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the denouement the completion of sort </v>

151
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:05.354
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is it the completion of </v>

152
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from,</v>

153
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.923
<v Speaker 1>from reading that text and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously familiarity with all this </v>

154
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.323
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you maintain that there is not an </v>

155
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.354
<v Speaker 1>ideology that there is not a dogma or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose there's a distinction between </v>

156
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>ideology and dogma?</v>

157
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the temperature is great from that </v>

158
00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:30.271
<v Speaker 2>point of view because it shows you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have inbuilt compulsions,</v>

159
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.940
<v Speaker 2>one of which is that will to power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

160
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.030
<v Speaker 2>here's this wonderful magic island and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we said this before,</v>

161
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the moment you set foot on that island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be.</v>

162
00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It's key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a result of that,</v>

163
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.143
<v Speaker 2>you're prepared to kill somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve control over that potential </v>

164
00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

165
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 2>And so utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in touch with magic,</v>

166
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 2>which is very important because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

167
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.043
<v Speaker 2>it's a political place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it's a spiritual place where </v>

168
00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 2>anything is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the mind can be free.</v>

169
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>But although we see that compulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see others as well,</v>

170
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.530
<v Speaker 2>we see that there's a parenting </v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion in that play.</v>

171
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the island is ruled by Prospero.</v>

173
00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:13.660
<v Speaker 2>The magician who has</v>

174
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.400
<v Speaker 1>correct there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you just tell me briefly the story,</v>

175
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:17.234
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a particular effort to make this </v>

176
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>podcast accessible to idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mainly do it by being one,</v>

177
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 1>but I also do it by sometimes filling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap.</v>

178
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:27.340
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.423
<v Speaker 1>in the tempest of which there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good film version made a character </v>

180
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:36.400
<v Speaker 1>of Prospero is a shipwrecked on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>island find and you've taken it from me.</v>

181
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.380
<v Speaker 2>He used to be a duke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

182
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Speaker 2>he's an intellectual and so he's a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in Italy.</v>

183
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.773
<v Speaker 2>He's overthrown by his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's cast ashore and with his daughter </v>

184
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.713
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

185
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>and finds his way to this magic island </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he rules the spirits through the,</v>

186
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.900
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

187
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.333
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the keys to magic and science that he's </v>

188
00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>found in his books by a peculiar chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

189
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

190
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.690
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

191
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

192
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.940
<v Speaker 2>enemies that he has find themselves cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his island too.</v>

193
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.770
<v Speaker 2>He conjures up a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

194
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 2>a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

195
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.680
<v Speaker 2>to shipwreck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's all about how,</v>

196
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.750
<v Speaker 2>how committed to revenge he is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be [inaudible],</v>

197
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.560
<v Speaker 2>but in the process he also wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>marry his daughter off.</v>

198
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.830
<v Speaker 2>So there's a whole load of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stories running through it,</v>

199
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but by stripping it down to a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolated people on an isolated island in</v>

200
00:11:36.581 --> 00:11:39.100
<v Speaker 2>a magical see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes archetypes.</v>

201
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it was very deliberate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's is a.</v>

202
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 1>There is a fusion of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are characters that are magical,</v>

203
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.770
<v Speaker 1>like Ariel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Kaliban who sort of odd,</v>

204
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a living piece of soil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the native priests of</v>

205
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 2>colonialism as we would understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is that.</v>

206
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that right to say leave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonialism for a second.</v>

207
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking those two characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this area who is a spirit and </v>

208
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 2>there's Kaliban who is a former slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says in the stage directions,</v>

209
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>but they show you how complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare understands these archetypes</v>

210
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>are because the beast is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

211
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>The angelic is part of the human too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these pressures and impulses.</v>

212
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:28.924
<v Speaker 2>They're at war with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so getting back to your original </v>

213
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.524
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was about power and the tempest </v>

214
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.983
<v Speaker 2>and the dogma that were finally given is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have the greatest spirituality </v>

215
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.083
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have the strongest access to </v>

216
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:47.254
<v Speaker 2>magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is science we don't understand </v>

217
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.534
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have humiliated and hypnotized </v>

218
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 2>and conquered your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>

219
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Now in Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

220
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving it up.</v>

221
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.640
<v Speaker 2>So there's this fantastic famous speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of,</v>

222
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.503
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the templates where Prospero says </v>

223
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:12.451
<v Speaker 2>that everything must dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is like a play and everything</v>

224
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.664
<v Speaker 2>is just atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to me that's the vision </v>

225
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>that's at the heart of Shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 2>because however solid you are,</v>

226
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.593
<v Speaker 2>however real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little stage or the little </v>

227
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:28.774
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a territory you control is when it </v>

228
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:38.101
<v Speaker 2>comes down to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What matters is the spiritual level,</v>

229
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 2>which you may see as religious or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>may see as a matter of conscience or you</v>

230
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:43.684
<v Speaker 2>may see a psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to recognize that you are </v>

231
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 2>not who you think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a play,</v>

232
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.593
<v Speaker 2>that can be the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean that you are not who </v>

233
00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 2>you think you are?</v>

234
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare tends to take the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take his tragedies,</v>

235
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there about ambition.</v>

236
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.203
<v Speaker 2>Macbeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man who's a soldier and wants to </v>

237
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.310
<v Speaker 2>become king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

238
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.453
<v Speaker 2>it's about king lear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man who at the end of his life is a </v>

239
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:15.830
<v Speaker 2>king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

240
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.043
<v Speaker 2>it may be a fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an African who believes in love as </v>

241
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In those tragedies.</v>

242
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.450
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point,</v>

243
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.493
<v Speaker 2>they're forced to understand that their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their passions and their human frailty </v>

244
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.530
<v Speaker 2>destroy their self image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a king must find himself a beggar.</v>

245
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm someone who believes that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>is his to divide and rule or buckwheat,</v>

246
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

247
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 2>that guy has got to become homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to experience insanity.</v>

248
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>If he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he's on a path towards big question</v>

249
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 2>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

250
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.880
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare is not.</v>

251
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 2>He's not telling you where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not telling you where you can be as</v>

252
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 2>a dramatist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's holding the mirror up to nature.</v>

253
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:13.740
<v Speaker 2>The famous phrase to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.570
<v Speaker 2>the complexity of human behavior and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite fallibility of human judgment.</v>

255
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

256
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.983
<v Speaker 2>he's offering you images of failure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to make you think about </v>

257
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 2>alternatives in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

258
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.080
<v Speaker 1>archetype or journey that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing,</v>

259
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.183
<v Speaker 1>a figure or hero or anti hero with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>self image who over the course of the </v>

260
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:42.434
<v Speaker 1>story has that self image destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems read or learn of the early parts </v>

261
00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:55.021
<v Speaker 1>of the Siddhartha and religious stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are confronted with and and,</v>

262
00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and to draw upon what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the tempest.</v>

263
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.163
<v Speaker 1>We're confronted with the futility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>material pursuits were confronted with </v>

264
00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:05.374
<v Speaker 1>the futility of ideological or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frailty of ideological certainty that </v>

265
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.190
<v Speaker 1>this experience will deliver us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impermanence.</v>

266
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's your academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness that the tempest is likely his</v>

267
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 1>final play and therefore the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech in the tempest,</v>

268
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.720
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be saying everything's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just an illusion.</v>

269
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are temporarily held together.</v>

270
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.343
<v Speaker 1>We're going to awaken from the dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>into enlightenment without trying to </v>

271
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 1>give that a particular doctrinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

272
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

273
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.740
<v Speaker 1>he don't give that over to Christianity.</v>

274
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give that over to monarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said before,</v>

275
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you loved about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare was he seems not to be bound</v>

276
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.540
<v Speaker 1>to any particular ideology that enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to play out the narrative of a young</v>

277
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:59.851
<v Speaker 1>woman or a slave or a king or a murderer</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a ct period,</v>

278
00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

279
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.333
<v Speaker 1>and like it's so quite well known that </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical and geographical accuracy is </v>

280
00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 1>not what you go to these plays for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go there for a deeper truth.</v>

281
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Our certain ru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

282
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.203
<v Speaker 1>what Shakespeare was saying was we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what Shakespeare was talking about </v>

283
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 1>to a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made so much else was transcendence.</v>

284
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we said like Shakespeare,</v>

285
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last plate,</v>

286
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 2>and it's called the templates as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's not the last thing he wrote</v>

287
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't collaborate who does </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

288
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.613
<v Speaker 2>But if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where being an academic </v>

289
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:32.534
<v Speaker 2>comes in and being able to read all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and get paid for it comes </v>

290
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get hold of a big book,</v>

291
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.043
<v Speaker 2>like the complete works of Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which incidentally I got when my dad </v>

292
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 2>came home from a week at the TUC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

293
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.263
<v Speaker 2>he was a trade unionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he'd sort of somehow gleam and the </v>

294
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>fact that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at school was sort of interested in,</v>

295
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in plays,</v>

296
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.503
<v Speaker 2>he went and bought me this complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>works of Shakespeare and I sat down to </v>

297
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.880
<v Speaker 2>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

298
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.030
<v Speaker 2>and I remember reading King Lear while </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a football match on because it</v>

299
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:07.460
<v Speaker 2>was a Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

300
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.530
<v Speaker 2>and I was astonished by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so much of this guy's work and</v>

301
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.690
<v Speaker 2>yet every single paragraph seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of rich and challenging.</v>

302
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's an ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction for a young boy with a football</v>

303
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:21.744
<v Speaker 2>and in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a very particular </v>

304
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 2>relationship with that language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's possible.</v>

305
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

306
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.533
<v Speaker 2>but by reading so much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do get a sense of an </v>

307
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 2>autobiographical journey or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biographical journey,</v>

308
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>which maybe isn't that conscious to </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>

309
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 2>He does seem to be a conventional writer</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his time.</v>

310
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.650
<v Speaker 2>He writes big plays about history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to some extent he's latching onto the</v>

311
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 2>fact that it's a patriotic time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

312
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 2>we've just beat the Spaniards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

313
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a queen on board and things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking quite okay,</v>

314
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's cherish her and let's boost the,</v>

315
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

316
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 2>the current ideology and the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national national wellbeing.</v>

317
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.763
<v Speaker 2>Gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you move through the end of the 15 </v>

318
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 2>nineties into the 16 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the queen's getting old,</v>

319
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.330
<v Speaker 2>people are becoming more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more desperate about the future.</v>

320
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that social change is happening,</v>

321
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.010
<v Speaker 2>which involves the creation of a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>landless comm class.</v>

322
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Speaker 2>There's terrible homelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

323
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this time,</v>

324
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.473
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there?</v>

325
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.383
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

326
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.283
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

327
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 2>like now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like now there are people,</v>

328
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:34.020
<v Speaker 2>good sturdy base beggars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 beggars,</v>

329
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.503
<v Speaker 2>and if they come into your parish then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your job is to whip them out the </v>

330
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 2>traditional English same as dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social problem.</v>

331
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:43.794
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

332
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social cleansing and,</v>

333
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.073
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that begins to come through until the </v>

334
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:49.284
<v Speaker 2>place themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as the place become a richer and </v>

335
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:52.584
<v Speaker 2>more complex psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also more outreaching and awe </v>

336
00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 2>and shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think socially,</v>

337
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.843
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to the end of his career </v>

338
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>and he's only in his 40 [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's not that kind of ancient.</v>

339
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a religious element,</v>

340
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.923
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mythical element which runs through a </v>

341
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 2>whole load of plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.863
<v Speaker 2>their names for those of you who've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pens and papers out because we </v>

343
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:16.554
<v Speaker 2>should be learning the pricklies </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolizing the winter's tale and the </v>

344
00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:22.494
<v Speaker 2>tempest.</v>

345
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.680
<v Speaker 2>They all are mythical plays and they all</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with those ideas that you,</v>

346
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you asked me about the beginning weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

347
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

348
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 2>about parenthood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the parenthood that,</v>

349
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be written up in a negative </v>

350
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 2>guidebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

351
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:41.963
<v Speaker 2>If you read King Lear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know how not to bring up your </v>

352
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:44.690
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

353
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:45.803
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're about the mythical relationship </v>

354
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 2>between parents and children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're about the life journey,</v>

355
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.683
<v Speaker 2>which every single person takes as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and every single person is </v>

356
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.634
<v Speaker 2>there for tossed backwards and forwards </v>
<v Speaker 2>by tempests flies between bliss and </v>

357
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:03.484
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a complete journey because </v>

358
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 2>you as an individual must find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

359
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 2>So love is part of the mythology and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a couple must create the future.</v>

360
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So parenting becomes the mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

361
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole series of these mythical</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramas which take place in a world which</v>

362
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:28.174
<v Speaker 2>is partly real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly familiar because it's about </v>

363
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:32.690
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

364
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 2>partly because it's political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about running countries,</v>

365
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythical and finally spiritual.</v>

366
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just in the tempest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prospero is this Megan's character.</v>

367
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.813
<v Speaker 2>Can someone named Megan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Amigas is a man who has political </v>

368
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 2>power but also spiritual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual knowledge.</v>

369
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's a complete mess that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming for.</v>

370
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.013
<v Speaker 2>And prosper was a character who aims for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that completeness but of really have it </v>

371
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 2>because nobody can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in those plays,</v>

372
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.533
<v Speaker 2>there are glimpses of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally divine where I'm in in the </v>

373
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:14.831
<v Speaker 2>playpen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley's,</v>

374
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:16.640
<v Speaker 2>which is a wonderful drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

375
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.420
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tells the life story.</v>

376
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.240
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy called [inaudible] who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a prince of tire,</v>

377
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:23.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who at the beginning of the play </v>

378
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.740
<v Speaker 2>encounters sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

379
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.943
<v Speaker 2>he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented as a folk tale character who </v>

380
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:34.384
<v Speaker 2>must answer a riddle in order to love </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when a beautiful princess while he </v>

381
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 2>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he discovers that the riddle is,</v>

382
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.950
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

383
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 2>the father king antiochus is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusing his daughter and making her live</v>

384
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 2>in an incestuous relationship with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

385
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Merkley's is so shattered by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he runs away.</v>

386
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do what you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

387
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't confront the issue and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into a sort of reclusive,</v>

388
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:06.300
<v Speaker 2>semi coma as he travels around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and around the sea.</v>

389
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm from town to town encountering new </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups of people and until finally,</v>

390
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.833
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding the first half of the plate and </v>

391
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.233
<v Speaker 2>it happens all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This repetition because we're talking </v>

392
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 2>about repetition is obsession because </v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition is learning here.</v>

393
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.833
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he finds himself in a situation where </v>

394
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 2>there was a beautiful princess and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time he has to compete in sort of,</v>

395
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:29.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

396
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:30.794
<v Speaker 2>attorney [inaudible] I'm a has to defeat</v>
<v Speaker 2>other champions physically in order to </v>

397
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.520
<v Speaker 2>win her hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he wins her hand,</v>

398
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 2>they marry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they create a baby.</v>

399
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a tempest and she and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're halfway through the play.</v>

400
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.841
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plot here.</v>

401
00:23:48.841 --> 00:23:50.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the midpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.373
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes into a coma this time he </v>

403
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 2>literally will not speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for 12,</v>

404
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.123
<v Speaker 2>16 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just becomes a kind of a very rich </v>

405
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.470
<v Speaker 2>maritime tramp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

406
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 2>that old chestnut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rich maritime trend.</v>

407
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.293
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He is told that his daughter is </v>

408
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:10.634
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The daughter was given to some other </v>

409
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.900
<v Speaker 2>people to bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

410
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:15.734
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that this is late </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and without you really </v>

411
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:20.654
<v Speaker 2>understanding at what point it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it was the point of the </v>

412
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:23.444
<v Speaker 2>tempest when nature seemed to be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to everything human and when we </v>

413
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>were least able to achieve anything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives.</v>

414
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 2>And there's no point being clever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can answer a riddle.</v>

415
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no point being brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can beat a guy in a,</v>

416
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 2>in a Cheveria competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the storm comes,</v>

417
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.753
<v Speaker 2>you're done for.</v>

418
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.873
<v Speaker 2>And even that perfect dream of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of love and a child being born will be </v>

419
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 2>devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

420
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 2>that's only half the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sea is about tempests,</v>

421
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but the sea is about currents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>currents.</v>

422
00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:01.754
<v Speaker 2>Drive you apart and bring you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the end of that play will be when it </v>

423
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.620
<v Speaker 2>turns out that nobody who is dead is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

424
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.343
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

425
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.893
<v Speaker 2>the wife is alive and the daughter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and they all discover each other </v>

426
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they do,</v>

427
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:25.110
<v Speaker 2>there's the most amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The music of the severes happens because</v>

428
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 2>you're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always thinking with Shakespeare,</v>

429
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of mythical or current</v>
<v Speaker 2>or shape to these,</v>

430
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.083
<v Speaker 2>this drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so full of detail that you </v>

431
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:39.140
<v Speaker 2>can't really see what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in these last place,</v>

432
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:40.120
<v Speaker 2>and especially in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

433
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

434
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.853
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old man discovers that his daughter </v>

435
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.253
<v Speaker 2>is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The daughter discovers that her father </v>

436
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.720
<v Speaker 2>is alive and they suddenly hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music of the spheres.</v>

437
00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of Shakespeare's greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments because we in the audience can't</v>

438
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:02.054
<v Speaker 2>hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people around these two suffering </v>

439
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 2>individuals can't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only they can</v>

440
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>because they've been on a journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of us haven't exactly.</v>

441
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So later in his career it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about divinity.</v>

442
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:15.524
<v Speaker 1>And he began their story with grant </v>
<v Speaker 1>glimpses of the divine in you say that </v>

443
00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:19.184
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument that over the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his career as a writer or a </v>

444
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:26.951
<v Speaker 1>philosopher or however we turned him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is gradually distilling these ideas.</v>

445
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clarity is beginning to emerge.</v>

446
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.153
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me evidence that what's </v>

447
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:42.070
<v Speaker 1>powerful is that he is fueled by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of metaphysics.</v>

448
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Something that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to convey,</v>

449
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

450
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.223
<v Speaker 1>the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative itself that which is </v>

451
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>evident can only tell us so much that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

452
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:56.574
<v Speaker 1>through materialism and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalism achieve contentment of </v>

453
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 1>perfection or completion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

454
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:04.044
<v Speaker 1>with that perfectly story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first triumph leads to a period of </v>

455
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:07.614
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second period of the second trial </v>

456
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.843
<v Speaker 1>leads to unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's only through s forces which </v>

457
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:19.950
<v Speaker 1>cannot be contained or controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also through active innocence</v>

458
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.240
<v Speaker 2>lifted out of my story is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

459
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little daughter she grows up,</v>

460
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.550
<v Speaker 2>she finds herself confronted with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality too.</v>

461
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.493
<v Speaker 2>She's kidnapped and put in a brothel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because Shakespeare is always </v>

462
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.560
<v Speaker 2>potentially tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially comic,</v>

463
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.690
<v Speaker 2>she's in this ghastly tragic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

464
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.060
<v Speaker 2>it would be beyond tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too obscene to be tragic,</v>

465
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:48.570
<v Speaker 2>but she charms everybody by playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>music converts everybody who goes to the</v>

466
00:27:48.641 --> 00:27:52.840
<v Speaker 2>brothel into being chased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very funny scene.</v>

467
00:27:52.841 --> 00:27:53.820
<v Speaker 2>It's presented as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

468
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Speaker 2>as a committee and because of her active</v>
<v Speaker 2>embrace of the finest elements in life,</v>

469
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and that image of music is always sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of symbolic.</v>

470
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

471
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:06.723
<v Speaker 2>it enables her to go onto the ship where</v>
<v Speaker 2>her psychotic father is waiting and </v>

472
00:28:15.641 --> 00:28:18.190
<v Speaker 2>she's the miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The turns,</v>

473
00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the key that wakes him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

474
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 2>that really badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

475
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's presenting you a picture of human,</v>

476
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequacy,</v>

477
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.343
<v Speaker 2>but there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dedicate yourself to purity of </v>

478
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:43.090
<v Speaker 2>spirit and compassion for others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can break through,</v>

479
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.860
<v Speaker 2>break through and help others.</v>

480
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a strong ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

481
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:51.460
<v Speaker 1>That's quite sort of a religious idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

482
00:28:51.461 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

483
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it may be because like everybody,</v>

484
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.713
<v Speaker 2>when they read Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they've read Shakespeare or just to </v>

485
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>see one play or read one poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

486
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>they think they know what Shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

487
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>And obviously I've been doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

488
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.273
<v Speaker 2>so I think I know what Shakespeare is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do actually believe that that's </v>

489
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:09.450
<v Speaker 2>what you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

490
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you see that journey and in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular powerful plays,</v>

491
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you find them acting out with increasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarity and simplicity.</v>

492
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.260
<v Speaker 2>And I mentioned the poems that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who would like to dash off after</v>

493
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 2>hearing this podcast and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where can I,</v>

494
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.750
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I,</v>

495
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 2>where can I find Shakespeare in neat </v>
<v Speaker 2>form?</v>

496
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I would say have a look at the poem </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Phoenix and the turtle.</v>

497
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of his late lyrics.</v>

498
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a purely abstract piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purely metaphysical,</v>

499
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.333
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical oncotype or about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage between a phoenix and a turtle </v>

500
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:46.804
<v Speaker 2>dove.</v>

501
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's a statement about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Shakespeare,</v>

502
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.633
<v Speaker 2>at least at certain times in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the relationship between </v>

503
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 2>individuals through love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romantic love,</v>

504
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.830
<v Speaker 2>marital love that breaks through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the paradox of two,</v>

505
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:09.700
<v Speaker 2>becoming one to be in one at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time as they are two separate beings.</v>

506
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 2>And so the finish and the turtle is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful piece of work.</v>

507
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very challenging in,</v>

508
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ways that kind of metaphysical,</v>

509
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does give you that statement and </v>

510
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 2>that everybody is capable in their lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>of achieving a miracle.</v>

511
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 2>And love is that miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really beautiful.</v>

512
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Moving on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

513
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 1>to Shakespeare and Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

514
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.510
<v Speaker 1>legacy I suppose because you've done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of work in a,</v>

515
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.993
<v Speaker 1>I suppose decolonizing Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we say you've done a lot of work </v>

516
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:46.750
<v Speaker 1>on like a Shakespeare in Gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare and race.</v>

517
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Tell us a bit about that stuff.</v>

518
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

519
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

520
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:52.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written this book called women as </v>

521
00:30:54.391 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Hamlet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good.</v>

522
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.303
<v Speaker 2>What I do is I look at performances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at people's detailed perception </v>

523
00:31:02.851 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 2>reception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

524
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.610
<v Speaker 2>how they channel Shakespeare in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cultures and times.</v>

525
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And the women as hamlet book is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that,</v>

526
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the historical gender assumptions of his</v>

527
00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:22.080
<v Speaker 2>time have been challenged from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that he wrote.</v>

528
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.520
<v Speaker 2>So I picked on hamlet because hamlet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest player in the world.</v>

529
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.593
<v Speaker 2>That's in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true because it's about the </v>

530
00:31:29.491 --> 00:31:30.324
<v Speaker 2>growth of an individual personality or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that we've been sort of </v>

531
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:33.200
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

532
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.420
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what you can see play by </v>
<v Speaker 2>play a year by year,</v>

533
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Shakespeare's development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see in hamlet as a play.</v>

534
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.150
<v Speaker 2>It's about someone who begins by not </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to exist.</v>

535
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hamlet's father has died.</v>

536
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.163
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will soon learn that he's been </v>

537
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:53.420
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having it,</v>

538
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.980
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as a result of that,</v>

539
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.940
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

540
00:31:56.941 --> 00:31:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too solid flesh would melt.</v>

541
00:31:58.561 --> 00:31:59.394
<v Speaker 2>He just wants to die himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's dragged into life by the ghost </v>

542
00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:08.481
<v Speaker 2>of his father and step by step we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>him undergoing transformations.</v>

543
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until the end he dies.</v>

544
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.350
<v Speaker 2>And we would like to say because if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was any other playwright,</v>

545
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:21.270
<v Speaker 2>we probably wouldn't be told what he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned [inaudible] and through to me</v>

546
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.650
<v Speaker 1>be more explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

547
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.573
<v Speaker 1>So Shakespeare's don't offend his </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience with this is what this means </v>

548
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:29.420
<v Speaker 1>because he's part of his genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his workout,</v>

549
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>and your own consciousness.</v>

550
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamlet's last words are,</v>

551
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 2>the rest is silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

552
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.520
<v Speaker 2>So we've all been waiting there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>author's message,</v>

553
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.893
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only the person who experiences </v>

554
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 2>complete obliteration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows the whole story of life.</v>

555
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>And he's got nothing to say to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're in those later plays,</v>

556
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to move into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly spiritual area.</v>

557
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 2>But in hamlet you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

558
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Hamlet is a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great play,</v>

559
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to really feeble little </v>

560
00:32:57.681 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 2>roles for women and what our theater and</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to eat a crap they.</v>

561
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're not given much to do </v>

562
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 2>apart from say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

563
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 2>hamlet and go mad and die.</v>

564
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

565
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a very short time,</v>

566
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:18.340
<v Speaker 2>women were playing hamlet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

567
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Short time?</v>

568
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first hamlet that I could find </v>

569
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.940
<v Speaker 2>played by a woman is in the late 17th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

570
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 2>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah,</v>

571
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.420
<v Speaker 2>roughly roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

572
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.330
<v Speaker 2>and that can only be possible because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

573
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.853
<v Speaker 2>after the restoration period in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latter half of the 17th century and </v>

574
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 2>women were allowed on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't at all before that,</v>

575
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.113
<v Speaker 2>but once they were allowed on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paucity of the material that </v>

576
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare written for them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>someplace became quite clear.</v>

577
00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

578
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:04.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became quite common for women to take</v>

579
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 2>on the role of hamlet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of the 19th century,</v>

580
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.063
<v Speaker 2>there were hundreds who'd done so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're not just talking about people </v>

581
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:13.574
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little gidding amateur dramatic </v>

582
00:34:15.891 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about leading professional</v>

583
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:18.404
<v Speaker 2>actresses around the world to come that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part because they recognized that the </v>

584
00:34:22.631 --> 00:34:24.730
<v Speaker 2>things I was talking about just now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

585
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.420
<v Speaker 2>are so important.</v>

586
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to a lot of actresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

587
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 2>when I put that book together and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

588
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 2>people who played king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who played him Ophelia,</v>

589
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.200
<v Speaker 2>or who played gertrude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother,</v>

590
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.510
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

591
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I really loved that play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was so frustrating being in it.</v>

592
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to speak those words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several said that to me,</v>

593
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.853
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to speak those words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They felt trapped in one tiny aspect of </v>

594
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 2>the geometry of that play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

595
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.403
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened is that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular points in history when there </v>

596
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>are major social changes that affect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that gender operates in a society,</v>

597
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a canary in a cage.</v>

598
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm an actress will say I want to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>that part.</v>

599
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I will play that out in now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's is going on.</v>

600
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

601
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it's happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm maxine peake,</v>

602
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>maxine peake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did it and just today they announced</v>

603
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.953
<v Speaker 2>in the newspapers that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to stream maximum peak </v>

604
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.540
<v Speaker 2>performance of hamlet.</v>

605
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And she did it in Manchester in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manchester Exchange,</v>

606
00:35:33.741 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 2>a theater in the round just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

607
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a where a lot of the roles were </v>
<v Speaker 2>across campus too,</v>

608
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.910
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't just one actress making the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big personal statement,</v>

609
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 2>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important in itself.</v>

610
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:57.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a company which is saying we've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to embrace the feminine in these plays,</v>

611
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.280
<v Speaker 2>but also politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

612
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 2>we've got to give more opportunities for</v>
<v Speaker 2>actresses to,</v>

613
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak those words.</v>

614
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening now.</v>

615
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and since I wrote the book,</v>

616
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:10.180
<v Speaker 2>which comes years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

617
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

618
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Yugoslavia in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were recently until years ago.</v>

619
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 2>They had the first black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hamlet on record.</v>

620
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It's about having access to roles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you agency,</v>

621
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:35.150
<v Speaker 2>but they also do more than that and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to alter the way audiences see</v>

622
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can,</v>

623
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.170
<v Speaker 2>you can do that in any old play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

624
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but to do it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

625
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Shakespeare and ensures that people </v>

626
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 2>understand that you're challenging</v>

627
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.130
<v Speaker 1>old assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

628
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Because Shakespeare's like this open </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal to the galaxy of what a human is.</v>

629
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.190
<v Speaker 1>You need to see black actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female actors play these parts.</v>

631
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.473
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise there is the hetero genius </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that what a human is is a </v>

632
00:37:11.221 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 1>white man.</v>

633
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since you mentioned the,</v>

634
00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:15.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

635
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 2>the race thing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

636
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>

637
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:20.254
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big ton of archetype of figure was the </v>

638
00:37:21.821 --> 00:37:24.490
<v Speaker 2>great singer and actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Robeson.</v>

639
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:25.833
<v Speaker 2>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was born at the end of the beginning </v>

640
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:34.870
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father was an escaped slave.</v>

641
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Bloody Hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

642
00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're that close to history.</v>

643
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

644
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father was a,</v>

645
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.503
<v Speaker 2>he was a reverend and ensured that Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Young Pool had the best education </v>

646
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.520
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a result of that,</v>

647
00:37:51.521 --> 00:37:53.230
<v Speaker 2>he managed to get his into a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>

648
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.190
<v Speaker 2>And then he got into a mixed race law </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

649
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.523
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a huge success on the football </v>

650
00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:01.654
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who first sang spirituals </v>

651
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:10.770
<v Speaker 2>in the concert hall and made records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's most,</v>

652
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:13.630
<v Speaker 2>most people know about him from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>musical,</v>

653
00:38:13.631 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 2>showboat where he sang old man river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.720
<v Speaker 2>and he was an actor as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many talents.</v>

655
00:38:22.721 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 2>It's an extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

656
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.173
<v Speaker 2>as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was invited to London to play a </v>

657
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:31.750
<v Speaker 2>fellow in 1930 with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Savoy theater.</v>

658
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 2>He was allowed on stage to play Othello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't allowed in the restaurant.</v>

659
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't come to the after party for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own show.</v>

660
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

661
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

662
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one critic walked out of the first night</v>

663
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.543
<v Speaker 2>because some black people had actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>been allowed to be members of the </v>

664
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:52.400
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't come here to see black.</v>

665
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

666
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 2>And Paul Robeson was also politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>very astute.</v>

667
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:00.544
<v Speaker 2>So in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made a point of telling the prime </v>

668
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:04.370
<v Speaker 2>minister about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

669
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:09.570
<v Speaker 2>so it became a public issue on who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting then that I do not know when,</v>

670
00:39:09.661 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 2>when are we talking about 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

671
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

672
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:13.294
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy enough to find out where using the </v>

673
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

674
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

675
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

676
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't using the Internet because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have in those days,</v>

677
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 2>but he was using the latest medium of </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>

678
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 2>so a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the first night,</v>

679
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Paul Robeson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because he was already so famous for</v>

680
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:28.700
<v Speaker 2>many things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

681
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.703
<v Speaker 2>gave a broadcast to people in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining that the reason why he was </v>

682
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:34.534
<v Speaker 2>playing othello in London was because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be allowed to play it in New </v>

683
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.093
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

684
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he were to be seen to be kissing </v>

685
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:44.170
<v Speaker 2>a white actress playing Desdemona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>

686
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be severe trouble.</v>

687
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.543
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what he said attached to that was </v>

688
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.893
<v Speaker 2>that a fellow who is this Morris African</v>
<v Speaker 2>general who was working for the army of </v>

689
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.494
<v Speaker 2>Venice in the 16th century but is </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded as basically sub human because </v>

690
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:09.330
<v Speaker 2>it was an ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

691
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.780
<v Speaker 2>he says that the situation that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>character Othello has,</v>

692
00:40:13.781 --> 00:40:18.781
<v Speaker 2>which is going to end in death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster is victimized.</v>

693
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.643
<v Speaker 2>I victimization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the situation of a fellow destroyed </v>

694
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.993
<v Speaker 2>in the 16th century in Italy is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as that of any person of color </v>

695
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.023
<v Speaker 2>on the streets of America now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 1930 number one Paul Robeson black </v>

696
00:40:38.621 --> 00:40:43.621
<v Speaker 2>actor is playing a part up until then </v>
<v Speaker 2>played by white actors makeup,</v>

697
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.440
<v Speaker 2>so he's claiming to have a real physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence on the stage.</v>

698
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.033
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying in the process that the </v>

699
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:53.704
<v Speaker 2>plays that William Shakespeare wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those hundreds of years ago in so </v>

700
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:57.783
<v Speaker 2>far as they are true are true about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>injustices of today and we're going to </v>

701
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>use these plays to make sure we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just seen on the stage physically in the</v>

702
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:08.614
<v Speaker 2>Savoy theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be seen on the world </v>

703
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:12.490
<v Speaker 2>stage and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in America are not going to come,</v>

704
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 2>but you now know about it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

705
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.413
<v Speaker 2>He politicized that content and </v>
<v Speaker 2>activated it is content that was there </v>

706
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.463
<v Speaker 2>late and he was able to utilize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose that's brilliant activism </v>

707
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.420
<v Speaker 2>as well as brilliant art and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely a crossover.</v>

708
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 2>How do you see Shakespeare being</v>

709
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>used in that way these days?</v>

710
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be focused purely on the,</v>

711
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

712
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.263
<v Speaker 2>race ethnicity aspect you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the start and we've had a </v>

713
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:49.780
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

714
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.793
<v Speaker 2>we're at university where I teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called multicultural </v>

715
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:55.214
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and it's a study of black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Asian performance since Paul </v>

716
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Robeson's Day I'm working in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare.</v>

717
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we've got to get put together a </v>

718
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:07.150
<v Speaker 2>big database of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

719
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.113
<v Speaker 2>as many of those performances as we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to trace with as much </v>

720
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:11.054
<v Speaker 2>information about the performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>directors and other black and Asian </v>

721
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.990
<v Speaker 2>artists who've been involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we put together the,</v>

722
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:21.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the database.</v>

723
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.573
<v Speaker 2>And I'm about two years ago we published</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results which showed that number </v>

724
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:30.130
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

725
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.973
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was why I did it in the first </v>

726
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:32.414
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a great history of people of </v>

727
00:42:36.081 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 2>color playing shakespeare in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

728
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 2>which is hardly known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

729
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a glass ceiling I'm watching.</v>

730
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago we could say that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>had not been a,</v>

731
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.250
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black hamlet in this country.</v>

732
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.173
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

733
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had not been a black Korea.</v>

734
00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Elena's pick a great role and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>find that even though with um,</v>

735
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.043
<v Speaker 2>with immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going right back to the 19 forties </v>

736
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:08.580
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

737
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:09.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with generations coming through and </v>

738
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.460
<v Speaker 2>finding their way into new industries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

739
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.313
<v Speaker 2>isn't everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although there was a big body of great </v>

740
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:18.284
<v Speaker 2>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't being given access to the </v>

741
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 2>really significant roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

742
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.793
<v Speaker 2>The reason for doing this was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare is the symbol of British </v>

743
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 2>culture that everyone can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you had,</v>

744
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 2>if you have access to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have access to something at the</v>

745
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>core of our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

746
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have access.</v>

747
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.323
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's deeply political then </v>

748
00:43:44.741 --> 00:43:49.741
<v Speaker 1>because you're continually pushing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that access is given in that what</v>

749
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.753
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare represent and therefore what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain represents or what power </v>

750
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.003
<v Speaker 1>represents is challenged and altered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a and I suppose in a more equal and </v>

751
00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>inclusive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

752
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

753
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it matter?</v>

754
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:08.614
<v Speaker 1>Or why does it matter to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why this personal crusade when </v>

755
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.500
<v Speaker 1>potentially you could be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

756
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's one way of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Shakespeare that would be right.</v>

757
00:44:17.231 --> 00:44:20.140
<v Speaker 1>What does this play mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the best performance of it?</v>

758
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Was the best way of delivering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>line?</v>

759
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.030
<v Speaker 1>What females are there that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a CSA?</v>

760
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Is it not an abstraction to politicize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

761
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that as a continuation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>content?</v>

762
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the content is the content.</v>

763
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Can I read you a speech which I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to have brought with me please?</v>

764
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I said a bit ago that what I </v>

765
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:45.270
<v Speaker 2>do with Shakespeare or what I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare as being about,</v>

766
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to some extent an accidental.</v>

767
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.123
<v Speaker 2>It's me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole point about so many </v>

768
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:54.804
<v Speaker 2>shakespeare plays is that they all say </v>
<v Speaker 2>farewell to the audience at the end and </v>

769
00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:58.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the for applause.</v>

770
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 2>But they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

771
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.093
<v Speaker 2>we've had a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all in a state of solidarity with </v>

772
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 2>the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually we're not the audience.</v>

773
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.623
<v Speaker 2>The collective being we are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals and you will all see what </v>

774
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:13.374
<v Speaker 2>you've just seen in a different way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were thinking about it differently </v>

775
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.373
<v Speaker 2>when you go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my view of Shakespeare is purely me </v>

776
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.413
<v Speaker 2>and I'm Shakespeare is mediated mediated</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the movies that you've seen or </v>

777
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.163
<v Speaker 2>based on Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that excellent tempest or the </v>

778
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 2>production that you saw on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

779
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on beamed down from the national theater</v>

780
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:44.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's mediated through editors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

781
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.260
<v Speaker 2>editions.</v>

782
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets in the way of </v>

783
00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.174
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is however one speech by </v>

784
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare written in his own hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

785
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 2>and that's a speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in the British library.</v>

786
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.823
<v Speaker 2>It's from a play that was never </v>
<v Speaker 2>performed in his time and called Thomas </v>

787
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.483
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a great statement by him </v>

788
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 2>because it's a play that he wrote in </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaboration with lots of other people.</v>

789
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but miraculously one speech has survived</v>

790
00:46:16.111 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 2>in his handwriting is the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we know?</v>

791
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

792
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:20.414
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you say that because that's </v>

793
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 2>your job to interrogate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to destroy a myths.</v>

794
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 2>And to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that he wrote it because we know</v>

795
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:36.780
<v Speaker 2>he was given the job of working on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular script and through looking at</v>

796
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 2>his handwriting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at looking at the spelling,</v>

797
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.300
<v Speaker 2>looking at the imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

798
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 2>scholars have deduced that it must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

799
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

800
00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:45.563
<v Speaker 2>that isn't in a bit of a circular </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument because to say this is like </v>

801
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore Shakespeare must've written it</v>

802
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't hold up in a court of law,</v>

803
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I think nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

804
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty well 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare scholars like me would agree</v>

805
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>that he wrote this great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what it's about.</v>

806
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

807
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a play about Sir Thomas Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the,</v>

808
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

809
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.273
<v Speaker 2>I think chancellor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Henry the eighth day and there </v>

810
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:17.421
<v Speaker 2>was a riot against immigrants and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent out to quell the right.</v>

811
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.060
<v Speaker 2>And this is the speech which I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>read out there.</v>

812
00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I think we better if you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

813
00:47:22.091 --> 00:47:24.300
<v Speaker 2>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show up.</v>

814
00:47:24.301 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I need no encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

815
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 2>So this is Thomas Moore and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing this,</v>

816
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>this group of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

817
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:35.980
<v Speaker 2>a xenophobic racist rioters in London.</v>

818
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.850
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes on strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

819
00:47:41.851 --> 00:47:42.684
<v Speaker 2>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.450
<v Speaker 2>do we call them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

821
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refugees do because the migrants,</v>

822
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

823
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 2>the vocabulary you use will color the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way people understand who they are.</v>

824
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And in this case they're strangers you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will put down,</v>

825
00:47:57.101 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 2>strangers killed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut their throats,</v>

826
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.400
<v Speaker 2>possess their houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alas,</v>

827
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:04.320
<v Speaker 2>alas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say saint.</v>

828
00:48:04.321 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Now the king should banish you with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

829
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:14.100
<v Speaker 2>what country by the nature of your error</v>
<v Speaker 2>should give you harbor view to France or</v>

830
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 2>flanders to any German province,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain or Portugal Ne.</v>

831
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere that not ideas to England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you must need to be strangers.</v>

832
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.193
<v Speaker 2>Would you be pleased to find a nation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>such barbarous temper that breaking out </v>

833
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 2>in hideous violence would not afford you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a boat on earth,</v>

834
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.880
<v Speaker 2>wet that it tested knives against your </v>
<v Speaker 2>throat's spoon,</v>

835
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:37.714
<v Speaker 2>you like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like as if that God owed not nor </v>

836
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:41.224
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>

837
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.980
<v Speaker 2>What would you think to be used?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thus,</v>

838
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.970
<v Speaker 2>this is the strangest case and this your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain ish in humanity.</v>

839
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.023
<v Speaker 2>So I might get struck out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare experts club for saying the </v>

840
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:00.874
<v Speaker 2>fact that this was probably written by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare in his own handwriting and </v>

841
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 2>it's the only speech by Shakespeare that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has survived in that form is irrelevant.</v>

842
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.080
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

843
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.180
<v Speaker 2>it's an example of the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

844
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 2>a piece of text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of writing,</v>

845
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:20.011
<v Speaker 2>a piece of dramatic writing could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very controversial in its time.</v>

846
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It was censored or not performed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

847
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

848
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:27.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

849
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:28.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

850
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:29.973
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

851
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>the sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Tilney wrote,</v>

852
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:37.270
<v Speaker 2>leave out the insurrection holy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there have and not otherwise,</v>

853
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 2>but your own perils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

854
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.400
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't right in the center of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

855
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.510
<v Speaker 2>That's encouraging gaps would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

856
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So maybe shakespeare just did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because someone said,</v>

857
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do this speech?</v>

858
00:49:49.811 --> 00:49:50.920
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm knocking off.</v>

859
00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

860
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.000
<v Speaker 2>or it may be that it was a speech he </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt passionately about,</v>

861
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have a right to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionately about it now.</v>

862
00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:03.210
<v Speaker 2>And to say that I'm the one occasion </v>
<v Speaker 2>when Shakespeare does appear to be.</v>

863
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:08.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking directly about society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about intolerance,</v>

864
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 2>about xenophobic tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

865
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 2>he's doing it in those terms which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>so true to us now.</v>

866
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.453
<v Speaker 2>And when you said right at the start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I mean when I said that </v>

867
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare encourages us to realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're not who we think they are.</v>

868
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.533
<v Speaker 2>That's what this picture is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is saying to the honest London citizens </v>

869
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.480
<v Speaker 2>of the 16th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

870
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 2>well put yourself in their shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

871
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.453
<v Speaker 2>And think what a disgusting life you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will lead and hold up a mirror to </v>

872
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:43.090
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

873
00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the role of the Shaman is that </v>

874
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.983
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare can fall into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of sort of almost anything </v>

875
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:51.214
<v Speaker 1>and present so many views and in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>case invites us to look at what we </v>

876
00:50:59.321 --> 00:51:01.240
<v Speaker 1>consider to be objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really true.</v>

877
00:51:01.241 --> 00:51:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I am English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is alien.</v>

878
00:51:03.491 --> 00:51:05.130
<v Speaker 1>This is otherness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

879
00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.651
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

880
00:51:05.651 --> 00:51:06.484
<v Speaker 1>those categories can continually shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by moving to another place you </v>

881
00:51:10.091 --> 00:51:11.710
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now the stranger.</v>

882
00:51:11.711 --> 00:51:15.160
<v Speaker 1>The Stranger is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Only circumstance.</v>

883
00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:19.300
<v Speaker 1>The temporal that present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seemed to you to be objective.</v>

884
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So if someone that has access to a multi</v>
<v Speaker 1>valence can say,</v>

885
00:51:22.991 --> 00:51:23.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

886
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:23.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

887
00:51:23.621 --> 00:51:24.910
<v Speaker 1>nothing is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is real,</v>

888
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.420
<v Speaker 1>and it seems that that in the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes his conclusion.</v>

889
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Now these evidently there is power in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this writing because the,</v>

890
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:36.973
<v Speaker 1>the time it was censored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to touch again on what you said </v>

891
00:51:40.301 --> 00:51:42.370
<v Speaker 1>about is it poor ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

892
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know from the research that Gareth did</v>

893
00:51:45.521 --> 00:51:50.521
<v Speaker 1>with you that there's a story about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA attempting to censure like 500 years</v>

894
00:51:51.701 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

895
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

896
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Paul Robeson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

897
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.840
<v Speaker 1>experiences performing Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us about that place?</v>

898
00:51:58.841 --> 00:51:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

900
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

901
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't content to do Shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a great play.</v>

902
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it because he saw it as a great </v>

903
00:52:07.651 --> 00:52:08.610
<v Speaker 2>role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

904
00:52:08.611 --> 00:52:09.444
<v Speaker 2>for a black performer and beyond that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it as a great indictment of racial </v>

905
00:52:14.611 --> 00:52:15.444
<v Speaker 2>attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is 1930 and he's a newcomer to </v>

906
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 2>transcript theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

907
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:27.560
<v Speaker 2>and he's a stranger in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>British classical drama,</v>

908
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but he goes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

909
00:52:31.981 --> 00:52:32.814
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could have become the next Martin </v>

910
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther King.</v>

911
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And if he had a pretty good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll make sense in 20 years.</v>

912
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

913
00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it came to it,</v>

914
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.493
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther King in the 50th didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be in any way grouped with the </v>

915
00:52:51.361 --> 00:52:54.330
<v Speaker 2>name of Paul Robeson because Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robeson was also a socialist.</v>

916
00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 2>And being a socialist in the 19 thirties</v>
<v Speaker 2>means that you are,</v>

917
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:02.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antifascist it means you're pro Russian </v>

918
00:53:05.371 --> 00:53:09.150
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that your feet dirty,</v>

919
00:53:09.151 --> 00:53:12.450
<v Speaker 2>communist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the FBI in,</v>

920
00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:13.383
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

921
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they were very concerned to </v>

922
00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:22.950
<v Speaker 2>silence ropes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

923
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:24.023
<v Speaker 2>it's the time of mccarthyism were ropes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually appeared before the </v>

924
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Mccarthy Committee and announced them as</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti American as,</v>

925
00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 2>as Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't ask them as only Americans.</v>

926
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary.</v>

927
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:36.271
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife,</v>

928
00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the same thing and she was brilliant</v>

929
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:38.853
<v Speaker 2>to think that have enough bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems without going up against </v>

930
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>mccarthyism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

931
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.970
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

932
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 2>and he was given many opportunities to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to narrow his focus,</v>

933
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 2>to shut up on the subjects that were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>contentious,</v>

934
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.610
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

935
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 2>so he was blacklisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

936
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:03.640
<v Speaker 2>and the irony is the authority on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

937
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 2>So he couldn't perform in America.</v>

938
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:06.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all his recording contracts were </v>

939
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 2>abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

940
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.363
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay because he's an </v>

941
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.560
<v Speaker 2>internationally celebrated international</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrity.</v>

942
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 2>He's also the black that is also the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first black film star.</v>

943
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 2>He made great films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the 19 thirties,</v>

944
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we could easily come to another </v>

945
00:54:23.071 --> 00:54:28.071
<v Speaker 2>country like England or Wales or France </v>
<v Speaker 2>and perform here.</v>

946
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And so they took his passport away so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't perform in America.</v>

947
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 2>He can't perform abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

948
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.573
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found extraordinary ways of getting </v>

949
00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:41.600
<v Speaker 2>round that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

950
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 2>he gave a concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

951
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 2>on the American side of the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>border to Canadians.</v>

952
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>He did that as an annual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

953
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:57.290
<v Speaker 2>he used the new power of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

954
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.183
<v Speaker 2>of the telephone that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd later and Atlantic telephone </v>

955
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>cable in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a result of that,</v>

956
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.333
<v Speaker 2>he was able to give concerts from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat in New York and to some pancreas </v>

957
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.124
<v Speaker 2>town hall.</v>

958
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.740
<v Speaker 2>And we did an exhibition about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I displayed the phone bill.</v>

959
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

960
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.940
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

961
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.803
<v Speaker 2>there was a dispute over the phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to make it so expensive you </v>

962
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 2>couldn't afford to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trade unionists in London,</v>

963
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:30.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 2>came up with the cash so it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

965
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

966
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.380
<v Speaker 2>it's even the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

967
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 2>that some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including me,</v>

968
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:42.140
<v Speaker 2>would argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

969
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.660
<v Speaker 2>ultimately at the end of the fifth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

970
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:49.680
<v Speaker 2>the CIA decided that because these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

971
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:50.663
<v Speaker 2>conventional censorship techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't working because he was </v>

972
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 2>determined to find ways of surmounting </v>
<v Speaker 2>censorship.</v>

973
00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

974
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:01.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

975
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.590
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

976
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 2>to work with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the American record companies.</v>

977
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:09.083
<v Speaker 2>So he founded his own company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fellow records which published his </v>

978
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.220
<v Speaker 2>records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

979
00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he carried his music,</v>

980
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:20.620
<v Speaker 2>but also that people like Pete Seeger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

981
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 2>people on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left,</v>

982
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 2>people who were going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is in 10 years,</v>

983
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.033
<v Speaker 2>20 years time.</v>

984
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to imagine that ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a man that existed,</v>

985
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.970
<v Speaker 2>but he did because of his bravery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his determination,</v>

986
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:40.670
<v Speaker 2>his absolute commitment and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination not to compromise.</v>

987
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.410
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

988
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:45.820
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

989
00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:50.821
<v Speaker 2>his passport was given back to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was ruled unconstitutional to</v>

990
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 2>take the person's passport away for </v>
<v Speaker 2>political purposes.</v>

991
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:55.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he left America at the end of the </v>

992
00:56:57.851 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 2>fifth years and came back to Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Russia for instance,</v>

993
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:07.400
<v Speaker 2>and in Russia his life changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

994
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 2>he'd already performed a fellow here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>

995
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It's rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uneven at the age of 60,</v>

996
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:18.930
<v Speaker 2>and he'd already been in on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor of the Notting Hill Carnival.</v>

997
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a sponsor for the very first one.</v>

998
00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:25.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to Moscow where he was hugely </v>

999
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:30.904
<v Speaker 2>popular and was planning to go to Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was taken extremely ill and his </v>

1000
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul ribs and junior,</v>

1001
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that he was,</v>

1002
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.383
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimented on by the CIA using you </v>

1003
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 2>mind bending drugs.</v>

1004
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was taken instantly ill,</v>

1005
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Paul Robeson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he became profoundly mentally unwell</v>

1006
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.323
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was physically destroyed because his </v>

1007
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:06.850
<v Speaker 2>mind and couldn't make his whole system </v>
<v Speaker 2>work anymore.</v>

1008
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.073
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his son in Moscow was in Paul Robeson's </v>

1009
00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.173
<v Speaker 2>hotel room after he'd gone into hospital</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had this suicidal compulsion to </v>

1010
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:19.174
<v Speaker 2>throw himself out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that convinced him that the CIA were </v>

1011
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:24.850
<v Speaker 2>behind the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1012
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 2>so that can be same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was a drug induced psychosis and</v>

1013
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:30.514
<v Speaker 2>that the cio will behind it because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that they have plans to do that </v>

1014
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:33.590
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1015
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.940
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1016
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 2>to Castro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1017
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.173
<v Speaker 2>the clincher for me is that I'm Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robeson was about to go by air from </v>

1018
00:58:43.091 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Moscow to Cuba as part of his world tour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was</v>

1019
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:52.870
<v Speaker 1>time you might want to not go on a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They include,</v>

1020
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:57.940
<v Speaker 1>must go on tokenistic blow money.</v>

1021
00:58:58.050 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's today that,</v>

1022
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.280
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's impossible to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ever such a person existed,</v>

1023
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:03.923
<v Speaker 2>especially because he did not know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the CIA probably did that when he </v>

1024
00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:10.080
<v Speaker 2>got to Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you got to Cuba,</v>

1025
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:13.780
<v Speaker 2>the Bay of Pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we scheduled etl.</v>

1026
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.193
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty convinced all the evidence </v>

1027
00:59:17.701 --> 00:59:21.190
<v Speaker 2>has been redacted that we know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1028
00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.133
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent six months going through FBI </v>

1029
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.380
<v Speaker 2>files that you can get on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1030
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.413
<v Speaker 2>and it's quite clear that it says the </v>
<v Speaker 2>health of Paul Robeson is an issue and </v>

1031
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:35.420
<v Speaker 2>then pages and pages of nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

1032
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm convinced that the one thing they</v>

1033
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 2>did not want would be that Paul Robeson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fierce,</v>

1034
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.543
<v Speaker 2>ferocious critic of American foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy would be in Cuba when they </v>

1035
00:59:47.181 --> 00:59:48.014
<v Speaker 2>invaded it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the point at which </v>

1036
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 2>censorship and oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1037
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.560
<v Speaker 2>a behavior designer decides it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

1038
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare then has power in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great deal of power,</v>

1039
01:00:05.831 --> 01:00:06.664
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inconceivably varied well of human </v>

1040
01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:13.954
<v Speaker 1>experience with recognizable themes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are seeing in many senses to talk about </v>

1041
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:19.744
<v Speaker 1>the futility of power in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that were persecuted in a </v>

1042
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:24.993
<v Speaker 1>pull ropes in would have done well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of read some of those plays and go </v>

1043
01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>out in a minute based system which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a prop up is pointless.</v>

1044
01:00:32.321 --> 01:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all temporary.</v>

1045
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>They should just let him off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1046
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1047
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1048
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>how do you see this resource?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this sort of almost,</v>

1049
01:00:44.351 --> 01:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it,</v>

1050
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously a unique resource </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have a,</v>

1051
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1052
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>an artistic work of such potency that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned,</v>

1053
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.393
<v Speaker 1>I suppose by the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily by their englishness </v>

1054
01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:06.751
<v Speaker 1>itself is like how do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you envisage it being utilized to</v>

1055
01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>continue the debate around power and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>power is shared,</v>

1056
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see your obligations as,</v>

1057
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1058
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:14.933
<v Speaker 1>as a shakespeare expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You called yourself that and you beat </v>

1059
01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>your chest as you said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1060
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.983
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how can other people also made </v>

1061
01:01:23.711 --> 01:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>invisible quotation marks in the air at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time you did that year?</v>

1062
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird things went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for Mandy.</v>

1063
01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>So I'm interested in language Marcel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marceau across the table now.</v>

1064
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we,</v>

1065
01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>how can those of us that are interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in power utilize shakespeare?</v>

1066
01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you like</v>

1067
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>see happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're going to do?</v>

1068
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.990
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the responsibility is to young people.</v>

1069
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important that whether your,</v>

1070
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:53.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1071
01:01:53.281 --> 01:01:57.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Asian kid in Leicester,</v>

1072
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether your a kid with parents who came</v>

1073
01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:05.730
<v Speaker 2>from Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1074
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and you live in Glasgow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a kid in Poland,</v>

1075
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.353
<v Speaker 2>it's really important that these plays </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch you directly when your views of </v>

1076
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:21.804
<v Speaker 2>life are being formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about getting to hear the stories </v>

1077
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:31.611
<v Speaker 2>and to see the stories acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about getting to speak the words.</v>

1078
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1079
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it's about,</v>

1080
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>the empowerment that comes through </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

1081
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.833
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Shakespeare had just given us the </v>

1082
01:02:39.661 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 2>stories in the form that I've kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paraphrased them,</v>

1083
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 2>they would have been crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Shakespeare stood up,</v>

1084
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this bloke,</v>

1085
01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:49.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's a bit worried about.</v>

1086
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1087
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I said and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>really ashamed of it.</v>

1088
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:55.750
<v Speaker 2>And I hope you obliterate the tape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1089
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you've done a wonderful job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shakespeare.</v>

1090
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>One one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1091
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.983
<v Speaker 2>when we've been talking to people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian family backgrounds about </v>

1092
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1093
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often said to me,</v>

1094
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.003
<v Speaker 2>and it's families were more than one </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages spoken at home that really </v>

1095
01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:19.494
<v Speaker 2>respond instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're most richly to Shakespeare's </v>

1096
01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:22.524
<v Speaker 2>language because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're language senses being </v>

1097
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 2>stretched all the time and you're aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how ample it can be,</v>

1098
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:36.170
<v Speaker 2>and so you aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm deterred by the weirdness,</v>

1099
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 2>the opaqueness of the backwardness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare's a written language.</v>

1100
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 2>It's another possible way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1101
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:44.910
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of expressing yourself.</v>

1102
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>And so there's something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very multicultural about the,</v>

1103
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words themselves in that sense I say</v>

1104
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:54.170
<v Speaker 2>because they're abstract even from </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemporary English speakers,</v>

1105
01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:55.004
<v Speaker 2>so the levels yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so much poetry or shakespeare </v>

1106
01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:58.734
<v Speaker 2>will always use an image if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than give you a prosaic sentence </v>

1107
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:07.250
<v Speaker 2>and imagery works on your imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in ways that you're not aware of and</v>

1108
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:09.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously that Shakespeare would never </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever dreamt.</v>

1109
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can give young people that,</v>

1110
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the weaponry that they need</v>

1111
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 2>to get through being young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1112
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:22.670
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1113
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:27.830
<v Speaker 2>it's part of their sense of potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

1114
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.004
<v Speaker 2>You see what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a way there's something of a </v>

1115
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:34.650
<v Speaker 2>shaman about Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually do think that,</v>

1116
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.603
<v Speaker 2>but I would be thrown out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare experts club if I said that </v>

1117
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.160
<v Speaker 2>too many people and what it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictive in that club in it.</v>

1118
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1119
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:49.610
<v Speaker 2>you should see them God penguin suits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's an actor.</v>

1120
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare is an actor and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>playwright,</v>

1121
01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and his job as an actor is to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embody different people.</v>

1122
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:03.503
<v Speaker 2>His job as a playwright is to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Panorama as complex and diverse as </v>

1123
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:10.914
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Shakespeare is one of those writers </v>

1124
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's a playwright,</v>

1125
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 2>is always disagreed with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1126
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we are so lucky to have </v>

1127
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:25.430
<v Speaker 2>him as our national board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1128
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.463
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to some great novelists like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolstoy who is ultimately bound to be </v>

1129
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:33.304
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic at some point because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrator's voice will always interfere </v>

1130
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>with the accuracy of what he's telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1131
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.293
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Shakespeare is never in that </v>

1132
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>situation</v>

1133
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:43.863
<v Speaker 1>because the form is about story and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story is populated by character and the </v>

1134
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>character's must have opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you must have multi valence.</v>

1135
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:51.161
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1136
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>in an narrative for a narrative forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the novel,</v>

1137
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrator has dominion,</v>

1138
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.960
<v Speaker 1>so you say it's important for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit these parts,</v>

1139
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 1>to speak the words because it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

1140
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I said Alan Moore to say about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>spells and language.</v>

1141
01:06:09.221 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 1>That language will go work on you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we did that week of we did a word a</v>

1142
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.853
<v Speaker 1>week of workshops with the National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theater and the brilliant director in </v>

1143
01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Rickson where I've read different </v>
<v Speaker 1>monologues in different scenes.</v>

1144
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.413
<v Speaker 1>It what I found is it's like a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>is literally a code and the code in the </v>

1145
01:06:27.371 --> 01:06:28.204
<v Speaker 1>hands of a master like Shakespeare and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminated by an expert such as </v>

1146
01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:34.390
<v Speaker 1>yourself and a director would bring into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in the that you.</v>

1147
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.223
<v Speaker 1>I felt like when doing Kaliban and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prospero arguing about the change of </v>

1148
01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>their relationship since prosper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the island a while and like</v>

1149
01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't not nice to caliber in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1150
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.113
<v Speaker 1>I felt the adolescent may breathe back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a life with that sort of spurned </v>

1151
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:55.741
<v Speaker 1>sense of rage or when you work through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grace of hamlet,</v>

1152
01:06:56.950 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>you are forced into unexamined corners </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mind,</v>

1153
01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>are forced to confront aspects of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1154
01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:04.903
<v Speaker 1>If the language for it doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the phenomena itself is perhaps </v>

1155
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>doesn't ignored or it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not illuminated,</v>

1156
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.910
<v Speaker 1>if there's no language for it or is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>only the things that.</v>

1157
01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 1>There are words for being sad.</v>

1158
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.040
<v Speaker 2>That's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1159
01:07:19.041 --> 01:07:19.874
<v Speaker 2>take hamlet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need nearly all of hamlet's famous </v>

1160
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.490
<v Speaker 2>liquids which are so famous to be or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to have it.</v>

1161
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.570
<v Speaker 2>And they nearly all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1162
01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.260
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to the earliest texts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>

1163
01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an exclamation mark.</v>

1164
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1165
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.950
<v Speaker 2>how do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1166
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>the only way you can do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually capture that emotion.</v>

1167
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.413
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're on stage saying it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're sitting at home reading </v>

1168
01:07:46.971 --> 01:07:47.804
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a point of contact between you and </v>

1169
01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:53.234
<v Speaker 2>that text [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something which is not fully </v>

1170
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:59.660
<v Speaker 2>controlled and defined and limited.</v>

1171
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty beautiful because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1172
01:08:01.781 --> 01:08:02.614
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it starts with the word </v>

1173
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:08.440
<v Speaker 1>potato potatoes here I can and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1174
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:09.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it is like it's an open sound </v>

1175
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.690
<v Speaker 1>exclamation and you've got to go work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself psychologically.</v>

1176
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.533
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like a springboard,</v>

1177
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bonds you,</v>

1178
01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in the.</v>

1179
01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1180
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to swim in a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 2>or else you'll sink.</v>

1181
01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you get there?</v>

1182
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take you there.</v>

1183
01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.813
<v Speaker 2>So it's really saying as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing consumer can do this and we're </v>

1184
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.213
<v Speaker 2>saying collaborate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a bit of you and then I'll give </v>

1185
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you the words fucking</v>

1186
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>so you would not precious guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you like about him as well,</v>

1187
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Shakespeare is not precious.</v>

1188
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:47.610
<v Speaker 1>You said it's like robust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1189
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:50.100
<v Speaker 1>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be convinced,</v>

1190
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.150
<v Speaker 1>like being conservative with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare.</v>

1191
01:08:52.151 --> 01:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that miss the point sort of go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1192
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare has got to be some blonde </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloke.</v>

1193
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean handle it rather it has got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>some blonde bloke.</v>

1194
01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.054
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Christianity where </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually the iconic figure will morph </v>

1195
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:03.583
<v Speaker 1>into the convenient form to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of who is powerful Shakespeare </v>

1196
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:09.620
<v Speaker 1>because of the diversity within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text,</v>

1197
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>because of the conflict within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1198
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that open to now we'll have a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1199
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have someone from Poland do it and</v>

1200
01:09:16.651 --> 01:09:17.151
<v Speaker 1>they will have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1201
01:09:17.151 --> 01:09:17.984
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way of illustrating what </v>

1202
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:24.230
<v Speaker 1>power is in how power behaves and built </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

1203
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Our invitations for you as an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond how you,</v>

1204
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 1>yourself are contextualized for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationality or age or religion,</v>

1205
01:09:31.971 --> 01:09:32.804
<v Speaker 1>your gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find your essential humanity because </v>

1206
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:36.284
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that is found fruit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the diversity of these texts is we </v>

1207
01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:40.214
<v Speaker 1>all know what jealousy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know obsession is we all know </v>

1208
01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 1>what loneliness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbreak,</v>

1209
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>abandonment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejection,</v>

1210
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and those things supersede transcend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go around and flood our,</v>

1211
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.010
<v Speaker 1>the things we cling to the things we </v>
<v Speaker 1>cling to in this store.</v>

1212
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1213
01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really great that he began,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1214
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 2>to be successful as a poet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing the sonnets and so forth.</v>

1215
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:06.523
<v Speaker 2>But it's the plays that everyone thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>of because plays are public art and </v>

1216
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:17.443
<v Speaker 2>performance is a sharing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't mind me embarrassing </v>

1217
01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you when you were working on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Theater Studio Project,</v>

1218
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you did a performance,</v>

1219
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you've described,</v>

1220
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.633
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1221
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1222
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:36.710
<v Speaker 2>the high point of it was the end when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave that prospero speech,</v>

1223
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 2>which is about the end of things to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>member of the audience,</v>

1224
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.173
<v Speaker 2>a kid who was sitting there with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms folded most of the time determined </v>

1225
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>not to be impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you passed on the,</v>

1226
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>the words and the speaking role to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>was for me,</v>

1227
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.283
<v Speaker 2>totally brilliant and totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>shakespearian because that's the point </v>

1228
01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:04.070
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1229
01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 2>it's at handing on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1230
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:09.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a record well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1231
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:10.251
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1232
01:11:10.251 --> 01:11:12.400
<v Speaker 2>that last speech in the tempest is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1233
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.330
<v Speaker 2>a prospero says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1234
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.700
<v Speaker 2>if you from par as you from sins would </v>
<v Speaker 2>pardoned,</v>

1235
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 2>be let your indulgence set me free.</v>

1236
01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.473
<v Speaker 2>&lt;Unk&gt;.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this character who can </v>

1237
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>control the waves and the wind and meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>in people's minds.</v>

1238
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.520
<v Speaker 2>You can hypnotize them with a charm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1239
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:33.953
<v Speaker 2>he's only an actor now and he is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unless we in the audience choose to </v>

1240
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 2>forgive his weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why should we do that?</v>

1241
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.253
<v Speaker 2>Because we all need to have our </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses for given as you from sins </v>

1242
01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:52.840
<v Speaker 2>would pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a,</v>

1243
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.813
<v Speaker 2>give me some applause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's holding that mirror up to </v>

1244
01:11:57.421 --> 01:11:58.254
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I could keep on going back to </v>

1245
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a wonderful image for </v>
<v Speaker 2>and culture should do,</v>

1246
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:04.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the mirror at an angle and we see </v>

1247
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:08.274
<v Speaker 2>things in a way we are used to hold it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up straight to our faces and we're </v>

1248
01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:16.440
<v Speaker 2>forced to see ourselves and that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reassuring.</v>

1249
01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hopefully what's been spoken about,</v>

1250
01:12:20.491 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 2>what's been acted out in a play like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare and tragedy.</v>

1251
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's forced us to look that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's forced it to it more closely.</v>

1252
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1253
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It presenting us with truth or as close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the truth.</v>

1254
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:42.741
<v Speaker 1>It is plausible for us ever to go with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me our words as mere humans.</v>

1255
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful story.</v>

1256
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for sharing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences with Shakespeare.</v>

1257
01:12:51.481 --> 01:12:52.314
<v Speaker 1>With us today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned more seeing how Shakespeare </v>

1258
01:12:55.771 --> 01:13:00.771
<v Speaker 1>can be used as a tool for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>activism as a vessel for history because</v>

1259
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 1>they're it because of its the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multifaceted nature of the work.</v>

1260
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 1>There is a kind of alchemy there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled within it.</v>

1261
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for the education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

1262
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
