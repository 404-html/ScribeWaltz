6
00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:21.721
<v Speaker 1>attention in 2016 when he objected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech legislation in Canada.</v>

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>He has steadily been making a name for </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as a voice of the anti political</v>

8
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.124
<v Speaker 1>correctness movement and has cultivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>a slew of predominantly young male </v>

9
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touted by some as an academic rockstar.</v>

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And the most important thinker in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west and by others as a provocateur.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And firebrand of the alt right is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a new Internet savvy group of </v>

12

<v Speaker 1>controversial thinkers that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed the intellectual dark web Jordan </v>

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.943
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank you for coming on under the </v>

14
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks very much for the invitation.</v>

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.483
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to speak to you because my </v>

16
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:55.684
<v Speaker 1>interest in your work was either prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>to or somehow abstract from the </v>

17
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>controversies that have brought you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream attention.</v>

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.213
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking then as a clinical </v>

19
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering about the how,</v>

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interwoven the relationship between </v>

21
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>psychology and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mythology and archetypes is,</v>

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.333
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happened I think </v>

23
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:22.344
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the political scandal broke around </v>

24
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 2>me in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was in September,</v>

25
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>2016 people came to check me out because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the scandal,</v>

26
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 2>but they stayed because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>

27
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 2>By that time I already had about 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours of youtube lectures,</v>

28
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.703
<v Speaker 2>which probably saved me in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I was being protested </v>

29
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 2>against say and worn by the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what I was doing,</v>

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.373
<v Speaker 2>because it was hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>contravening the law people went on my </v>

31
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 2>site to find out what sort of person I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

32
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 2>And I had pretty much everything I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to students in the last 30 years </v>

33
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 2>taped and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ready for per what public viewing.</v>

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 2>My website had already had about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million hits then.</v>

35
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:03.884
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people got very interested in the </v>

36
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:07.914
<v Speaker 2>psychology and it's not surprising to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what I've been teaching since </v>

37
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 2>1993 is I think unbelievably practical.</v>

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm clinical psychologist so I've always</v>

39
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 2>been interested in trying to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's mental health.</v>

40
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 2>And I viewed putting the lectures online</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

41
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.153
<v Speaker 2>as part and parcel of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there were a lot of smart </v>

42
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:28.494
<v Speaker 2>clinicians in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They learned a lot about how you could </v>

43
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>put your life together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decrease anxiety,</v>

44
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:34.344
<v Speaker 2>decreased depression or in yourself more</v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively in your communication and </v>

45
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.294
<v Speaker 2>with regards to your longterm plans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand your dreams and position </v>

46
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.314
<v Speaker 2>yourself properly in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's been a real pleasure and a </v>

47
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 2>privilege to be able to bring that work </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the broader attention of wealth.</v>

48
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Now it's millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising.</v>

49
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:54.271
<v Speaker 2>It helps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people were geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that,</v>

51
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>talking about what Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud,</v>

52
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>young Karl Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Rogers,</v>

53
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.414
<v Speaker 2>Abraham Maslow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a slew of existential cycle </v>

54
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1950s humanists in the 1960s.</v>

55
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a dozen or so,</v>

56
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.444
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15 of great clinicians who laid </v>
<v Speaker 2>the groundwork really for clinical </v>

57
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>psychiatry and also for clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.044
<v Speaker 2>And they and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also develop well developed </v>

59
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy and therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations as we know it,</v>

60
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.533
<v Speaker 1>like a emergent myths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must bear the inflection of the </v>

61
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>culture in which it was conceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.023
<v Speaker 1>this is why I am particularly interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the areas of psychiatry and </v>

63
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>psychology that are resourced from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older materials such as a methodology in</v>

65
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that particularly in,</v>

66
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the names that you mentioned,</v>

67
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>mythology I used as a car to a supply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a common language.</v>

68
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

70
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 2>that's the right way of looking at it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>

71
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we act out stories.</v>

72
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That's why we tell stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

73
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why people are attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories because stories are the best way</v>

74
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:08.814
<v Speaker 2>of describing our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And stories have a pattern or they </v>

75
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

76
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>that's why there's comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

77
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 2>That's where everything turns out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way everyone wants it too.</v>

78
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's tragedy when </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything falls apart.</v>

79
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's adventure and romance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that covers a lot of territory,</v>

80
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:24.841
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adventure,</v>

81
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Romance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

82
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

83
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.440
<v Speaker 2>people like Carl Young in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

84
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 2>he was the deepest analyst of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

85
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Romanian guy named Murcia,</v>

86
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.544
<v Speaker 2>Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was also a very historian of </v>

87
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.670
<v Speaker 2>religions who was also very remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholar and very useful if,</v>

88
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental patterns of stories.</v>

89
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.710
<v Speaker 2>But young was very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deepest structure of stories.</v>

90
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that humans have languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every human culture has a language,</v>

91
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>but languages have a commonality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

92
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 2>They're all languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have a universal grammar.</v>

93
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:04.134
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a noam Chomsky's great </v>

94
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 2>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

95
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 2>And stories are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every culture has its own stories,</v>

96
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 2>but the stories have a universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammar.</v>

97
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 2>And so when was the first person who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who laid the groundwork for,</v>

98
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.123
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for discovering what that universal </v>

99
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 2>grammar was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's crucially important work.</v>

100
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that.</v>

101
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.053
<v Speaker 2>What a religious a religion is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a religion is a set of stories </v>

102
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:35.991
<v Speaker 2>that comes very close to the grammar of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories so and so there aren't,</v>

103
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 2>they aren't stories that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispense with hero stories like that</v>

104
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.623
<v Speaker 1>you say did great early work in mapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what might be the etymology or the </v>

105
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 1>sort of the Lt rhea truth from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>these patterns emerge?</v>

106
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:55.344
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>my interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that it</v>

108
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.963
<v Speaker 2>that cause look either when you're works</v>
<v Speaker 2>with image and Mandela in say for </v>

109
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.274
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the red book for it's that what it's </v>

110
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.333
<v Speaker 2>what is suggested by our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>observe patterns and the fact that we </v>

111
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:11.864
<v Speaker 2>respond to patterns is that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is some kind of universal </v>

112
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.681
<v Speaker 2>frequency that we are responding to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two clients who knew nothing about</v>

113
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>union psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of whom were badly fragmented.</v>

114
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 2>They were both women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both had,</v>

115
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I would say variants of post traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress disorder.</v>

116
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.163
<v Speaker 2>They had other problems as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And both of them produced spontaneous </v>

117
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 2>drawings that were first very fragmented</v>
<v Speaker 2>and disorganized.</v>

118
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>And then as they put themselves together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're ordering themselves,</v>

119
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:41.714
<v Speaker 2>let's say they produce drawings that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were increasingly symmetrical and </v>

120
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 2>regular and took on the Mandela like </v>
<v Speaker 2>configurations that young described.</v>

121
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And so that was absolutely fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch that.</v>

122
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.303
<v Speaker 2>And he thought of those patterns as </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of spontaneous order and </v>

123
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you'll see them in cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

124
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.253
<v Speaker 2>the great rose windows and cathedrals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are Mandelas and the rose windows and </v>

125
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 2>the entire cathedral structure is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

126
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.673
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to describe exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a cathedral is something like the </v>

127
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 2>optimal balance of structure and light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

128
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And the gothic cathedrals are also </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminiscent of forests,</v>

129
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:17.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With their,</v>

130
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:18.794
<v Speaker 2>with their arching branches and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light's coming through like the light </v>

131
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 2>coming through the leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's reminiscent of that.</v>

132
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:24.464
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cathedral that expresses the idea of </v>

133
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.303
<v Speaker 2>perfect structure and there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a Mandela that expresses that and </v>

134
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 2>something about music that expresses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>

135
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.193
<v Speaker 2>And it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all ways of trying to </v>

136
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:39.134
<v Speaker 2>symbolically represent how things could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be if they were put in the proper state </v>

137
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 2>of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harmony,</v>

138
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.620
<v Speaker 2>harmony is the right way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

139
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Harmonies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose all of these forms,</v>

140
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there could perhaps be </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the various disciplines,</v>

141
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Straw or informs and expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of golden rule seem to infer a</v>

142
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.553
<v Speaker 2>oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a truth that in earlier forms of </v>

143
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 2>language may be expressed as the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

144
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 2>wholeness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oneness.</v>

145
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w where the,</v>

146
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>what did he stand on the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in God.</v>

147
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the union idea is that,</v>

148
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.163
<v Speaker 2>that there's not much distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what young described as the </v>

149
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>archetype of the self and the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God and the self would be something like</v>

150
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The totality of your being across time,</v>

151
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 2>young thought of Christ as a symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the self and the reason for that,</v>

152
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 2>which is a very profound idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazingly profound idea.</v>

153
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Go and unpack it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

154
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the,</v>

155
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>the story of Christ from a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

156
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

157
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.743
<v Speaker 2>and you strip it down to its essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you essentially see is that the </v>

158
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 2>story of Christ is the ultimate tragedy.</v>

159
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.693
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate tragedy is the worst possible </v>

160
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 2>happening to the best possible person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

161
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the ultimate tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes it an archetype.</v>

162
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 2>You can't go past that for tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

163
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's an innocent man who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely sinless,</v>

164
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 2>who was working on behalf of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

165
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.070
<v Speaker 2>of only the good and the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broken and destroyed early and young and</v>

166
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 2>betrayed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the ultimate tragedy.</v>

167
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a,</v>

168
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedic element to it in the technical</v>

169
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:24.220
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause a comedy has a happy ending.</v>

170
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Clay wouldn't even require a full in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>light for the,</v>

171
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

172
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>for it to work immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would need to be a flow in Christ.</v>

173
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Is it that he has God made flesh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the floor?</v>

174
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.123
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it depends on what you mean by </v>

175
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

176
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.853
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to as modern people to think of </v>

177
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:40.074
<v Speaker 2>comedy as something that's humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But technically if you're looking at </v>

178
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>story structure or comedy is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that has a happy ending,</v>

179
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.553
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has a positive ending and that </v>

180
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.053
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's The resurrection story that makes </v>

181
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Christ's story a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedy.</v>

182
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Tada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

183
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.223
<v Speaker 2>This went so badly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this possibility of </v>

185
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 2>resurrection and the way that I read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that psychologically,</v>

186
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:04.380
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not trying to make any comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the metaphysics of it,</v>

187
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a part of people that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the self,</v>

188
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.420
<v Speaker 2>the young self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say cap the SLV council as self.</v>

189
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.263
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that is capable of sustaining </v>

190
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 2>itself across success of deaths and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebirths and everyone really understands</v>

191
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:20.214
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that's most fun </v>

192
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:21.684
<v Speaker 2>to teach people because you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're moving through life and you </v>

193
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 2>have a plan or a dream and it shatters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 2>someone dies or a relationship breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart or you,</v>

195
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you have a terrible upset in your career</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you become ill in some unexpected way</v>

196
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>that everything around you falls apart </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you plunge into a while,</v>

197
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>you plunge into a chaotic underbelly of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

198
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

199
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

200
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:47.454
<v Speaker 2>maybe you stay there because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the case that people get </v>

201
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.491
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

202
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 2>people die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are in despair permanently,</v>

203
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 2>but frequently something tragic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible be false.</v>

204
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 2>You and you fall apart and you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>something profound as a consequence.</v>

205
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.340
<v Speaker 2>And you put yourself back together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come back out,</v>

206
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.500
<v Speaker 2>you're more than you were when you went </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

207
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's happening at a small scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you learned something,</v>

208
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

209
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 2>if you ever really learned something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually painful.</v>

210
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.653
<v Speaker 2>It usually means that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that you're wrong in some </v>

211
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:18.474
<v Speaker 2>important way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to let that part of you that's </v>

212
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

213
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to let a new part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

214
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the self,</v>

215
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you undergo a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations in your life.</v>

216
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.063
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are collapses into the chaotic </v>

217
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 2>underworld and then red mini </v>
<v Speaker 2>resurrections that happens continually.</v>

218
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's what molds your character is </v>
<v Speaker 2>his self,</v>

219
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>is this thing that manages the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations across all those across,</v>

220
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 2>that manages all those transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

221
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.193
<v Speaker 2>here's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could identify with what you </v>

222
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what idiot logs do.</v>

223
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.823
<v Speaker 2>You could identify with you dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't understand and that's </v>

224
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>what sort of seekers after truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identify with,</v>

226
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 2>or you could identify with the process </v>
<v Speaker 2>of moving between those states.</v>

227
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you know what you're doing,</v>

228
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.980
<v Speaker 2>you know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

229
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in control and,</v>

230
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can become arrogant and identify</v>

231
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then become too static about it.</v>

232
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:16.054
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can be in despair and everything </v>

233
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>is chaotic and you all can identify with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

234
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.734
<v Speaker 2>in which case you're not allistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can view yourself as the thing </v>

235
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 2>that moves across the transformations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

236
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 2>that's the right way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

237
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.953
<v Speaker 2>to conceptualize yourself as you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that maintains constancy </v>

238
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 2>across transformations.</v>

239
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.140
<v Speaker 1>One imagines that your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

240
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.260
<v Speaker 1>with the controversies around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>linguistics and legislation in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>must have felt like one of those plunges</v>

242
00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:50.030
<v Speaker 1>into the depths on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say,</v>

243
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you feel a sense of personal tragedy</v>

244
00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:57.251
<v Speaker 1>and fear and a concern about consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that there may be no way back that it</v>

245
00:12:57.351 --> 00:12:58.184
<v Speaker 1>could represent a kind of death or did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it indeed represent a kind of death for </v>

246
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:01.964
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one for which you are subsequently </v>

247
00:13:03.051 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 1>grateful?</v>

248
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say for the first four months </v>

249
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.083
<v Speaker 2>when the political scandal broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very unsettling for a variety of </v>

250
00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:14.624
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first was that my occupation as a </v>

251
00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:21.470
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychologist and as a professor</v>
<v Speaker 2>was definitely in doubt.</v>

252
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.633
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university sent me two warning </v>

253
00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:26.210
<v Speaker 2>letters and that's standard hr </v>
<v Speaker 2>procedure.</v>

254
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Usually you get three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 2>The third warning is stop or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences won't be good.</v>

256
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.910
<v Speaker 2>If you work in human resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

257
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.280
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're going to go after </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone with tenure,</v>

258
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you have to document their misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to provide them with warnings.</v>

259
00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to tell them how they could get</v>
<v Speaker 2>back on the right track,</v>

260
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 2>and then if you have documented refusal </v>
<v Speaker 2>to comply with the warnings,</v>

261
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:48.980
<v Speaker 2>then they have grounds for dismissal.</v>

262
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You were close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were close.</v>

263
00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:52.340
<v Speaker 1>You were close today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

264
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>to some kind of personal or professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation or certainly damaged.</v>

265
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.584
<v Speaker 1>Now those for a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case on the off chance that </v>

266
00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:00.650
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are unaware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>d hours.</v>

267
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it as I understand it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me I've got it wrong.</v>

268
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.083
<v Speaker 1>The government changed the law say and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are neutral nouns that will </v>

269
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.700
<v Speaker 1>be mandatorily would be applied to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that identify as transgender.</v>

270
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You said that is an imposition on </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech.</v>

271
00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Whilst I would make a decision whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not I would,</v>

272
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:22.640
<v Speaker 1>if I was meeting a transgender person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to them how they want it to</v>

273
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:24.980
<v Speaker 1>be talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're making it law is an</v>

274
00:14:24.981 --> 00:14:27.090
<v Speaker 1>impediment on the freedom of speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then kicked</v>

275
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.491
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

276
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.140
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

277
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a good summary of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

278
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.333
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my sense there were two things </v>

279
00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:33.824
<v Speaker 2>are objected to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was that the government for the </v>

280
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.114
<v Speaker 2>first time in the history of Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 2>really in a move that was unprecedented </v>

281
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 2>in English common law under English </v>
<v Speaker 2>common law actually mandated the content</v>

282
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.713
<v Speaker 2>of voluntary speech and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what your excuse is for </v>

283
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no go zone.</v>

284
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not happening</v>

285
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:53.910
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

286
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.753
<v Speaker 1>This is what it seems to me like sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped me to understand this one </v>

287
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.581
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

288
00:14:57.581 --> 00:15:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm always interested in I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and where power is.</v>

289
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

290
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.743
<v Speaker 1>subsequently look what your views are </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that sort of poststructuralist </v>

291
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and the ot left and like a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

292
00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:11.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

293
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:11.981
<v Speaker 1>That though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that,</v>

295
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.040
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I,</v>

296
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the reason I think that the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy had fuel on both sides.</v>

297
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.820
<v Speaker 1>The reason it had an engine on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side is because it seems that,</v>

298
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:25.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed having watch I've interviews </v>

299
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.890
<v Speaker 1>and the objections that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewers have presented to you,</v>

300
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.933
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that our transgender person is </v>

301
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.604
<v Speaker 1>in a position of vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are saying this is not about </v>

302
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.553
<v Speaker 1>transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is about language and it's about </v>

303
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:41.320
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>

304
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.000
<v Speaker 2>That was my claim is that this wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>about transgenderism at all.</v>

305
00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

306
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm about mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got no strong view,</v>

307
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing or,</v>

308
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

309
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the sort of strong view </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would,</v>

310
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.663
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I was sufficiently qualified to </v>

311
00:15:54.901 --> 00:15:56.400
<v Speaker 2>make political statements about,</v>

312
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.051
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lecture.</v>

313
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Kyle goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

314
00:15:59.021 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but she's not my boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

315
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Look at the research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

317
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 2>The research for transgendered kids is </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite clear,</v>

318
00:16:05.021 --> 00:16:07.660
<v Speaker 2>is that most of them deceased by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they're 18,</v>

319
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm basically guided by,</v>

320
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.433
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he know Scandinavia where they </v>

321
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>check that stuff out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

322
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

323
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.680
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

324
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have criticized that research,</v>

325
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:17.224
<v Speaker 2>like all research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best research that's been </v>

326
00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:19.504
<v Speaker 2>done on the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other problem was with the </v>

327
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.294
<v Speaker 2>legislation was that I felt that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>an attempt by the radical left to gain </v>

328
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:32.050
<v Speaker 2>the linguistic territory and to define </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the terms of the debate,</v>

329
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

330
00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that was very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was objecting to that as well.</v>

331
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never will.</v>

332
00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:40.390
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I'm interested in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

333
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:45.391
<v Speaker 1>is I don't feel like the radical left is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful group.</v>

334
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Am I being naive here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean possibly in the world of academia</v>

335
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.903
<v Speaker 1>that I feel like they are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of a coalition bill </v>

336
00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:55.954
<v Speaker 1>around identity politics issues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would seem particularly important to </v>

337
00:16:58.511 --> 00:16:59.344
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my general view is if you identify </v>

338
00:17:00.821 --> 00:17:02.110
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call no problem.</v>

339
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.390
<v Speaker 1>It sounded my business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically my opinion.</v>

340
00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:05.224
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call you what you want me to call </v>

341
00:17:06.071 --> 00:17:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that you're speaking to me,</v>

342
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

343
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.280
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you see as sort of of the uh,</v>

344
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.143
<v Speaker 1>sort of the sort of extreme left or as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful organization like certainly in </v>

345
00:17:18.221 --> 00:17:19.054
<v Speaker 1>the universities he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they can get what done they could </v>

346
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.840
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get that legislation passed.</v>

347
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the woman,</v>

348
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I think the situation is different in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s than it is in other countries.</v>

349
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:28.724
<v Speaker 2>I think the political situation in the u</v>
<v Speaker 2>s is actually more balanced than it is </v>

350
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.870
<v Speaker 2>in most western countries because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say the,</v>

351
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radical left has a,</v>

352
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 2>has a pretty decent hold on a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions and,</v>

353
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 2>and first and foremost of those would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities.</v>

354
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.710
<v Speaker 2>But then the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>aren't without power in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States because they occupied most of the</v>

356
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 2>elected positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now do you use it,</v>

357
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.623
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the case in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't want to be identified with </v>

358
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 2>any of those groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I right?</v>

359
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.504
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't say that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that's on the right or the left </v>

360
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>or conservative or really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she didn't say whether or not you</v>

361
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.420
<v Speaker 2>believed in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

362
00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:00.254
<v Speaker 2>my political views are complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm temperamentally liberal </v>

363
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.040
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm pieing openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a creativity dimension.</v>

364
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.163
<v Speaker 2>People who are high in openness tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be liberal because they liked free </v>

365
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.770
<v Speaker 2>flowing information and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

366
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.600
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluid boundaries because information can</v>

367
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 2>move back and forth across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>

368
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.900
<v Speaker 2>So reject like that</v>

369
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.250
<v Speaker 1>ideologically you reject to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxonomies and you identify basically on</v>

370
00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:27.070
<v Speaker 1>the bay on the basis of research like </v>
<v Speaker 1>empiricism.</v>

371
00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:29.980
<v Speaker 1>In a sense you could say like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an open minded type of person.</v>

372
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:30.933
<v Speaker 1>This language is clinical psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really your faith is clinical </v>

373
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:34.683
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

374
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Well I've done a fair bit of research in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lab on yes,</v>

375
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.523
<v Speaker 2>the temperamental predictors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political predisposition and we can </v>

376
00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:43.214
<v Speaker 2>predict what parties people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>align themselves with by studying their </v>

377
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:48.320
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So liberal types,</v>

378
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.154
<v Speaker 2>liberal left types are high and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait called openness and open people </v>

379
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.400
<v Speaker 2>here are very open person and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell because you think laterally,</v>

380
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.263
<v Speaker 2>you know you have an idea and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>reminds you of a whole bunch of other </v>

381
00:18:58.611 --> 00:18:59.444
<v Speaker 2>ideas and so you'll move laterally </v>
<v Speaker 2>across ideas and a more conservative </v>

382
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:05.120
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll stay within the category,</v>

383
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your,</v>

384
00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:10.880
<v Speaker 2>your conversational style is is mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bye bye divergences.</v>

385
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.893
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually called divergent </v>

386
00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hallmark of great,</v>

387
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.843
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's good if you want to be </v>

388
00:19:15.891 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with them,</v>

389
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a price for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

390
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.473
<v Speaker 2>the price for creativity is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to catalyze an identity because </v>

391
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in everything.</v>

392
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

393
00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:27.704
<v Speaker 2>we'll flip from one thing to another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the problems that creative </v>

394
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:31.124
<v Speaker 2>people have while they have two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is they have a hard time </v>

395
00:19:33.021 --> 00:19:33.854
<v Speaker 2>establishing an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second is they have a hard time </v>

396
00:19:35.961 --> 00:19:36.794
<v Speaker 2>monetizing their creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to be a creative </v>

397
00:19:39.201 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>person and make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make money for other people,</v>

398
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.470
<v Speaker 2>but usually your dad by then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not very helpful for you do it.</v>

399
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And both of those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

400
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.020
<v Speaker 2>as a result of external structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imposition of external structures on</v>

401
00:19:53.241 --> 00:19:54.074
<v Speaker 2>the individual iee make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem of capitalism and you </v>

402
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:00.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commerce more broadly.</v>

403
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one of identity similarly,</v>

404
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is,</v>

405
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 1>is there a sort of a peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction in,</v>

406
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

407
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.313
<v Speaker 1>around identity in that like it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me on one level that you reject </v>

408
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.960
<v Speaker 1>taxonomies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that these systems,</v>

409
00:20:17.961 --> 00:20:18.794
<v Speaker 1>eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say women are being paid less </v>

410
00:20:20.061 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your argument would be,</v>

411
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute.</v>

412
00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:26.000
<v Speaker 1>There are other factors other than Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gender it here.</v>

413
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I exactly agree with the data.</v>

414
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersectional feminists always,</v>

415
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always claimed that you should take </v>

416
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>other factors into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

417
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Woman man isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

418
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Black isn't enough when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a,</v>

419
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a pay gap between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not only do due to gender,</v>

420
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it's due to all sorts of things and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to take them into account.</v>

421
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's an intersection of argument.</v>

422
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite funny that I get hell for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

423
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 1>He's an intersectional argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unlike,</v>

424
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.440
<v Speaker 1>so do you feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause what I sent you happening,</v>

425
00:20:58.441 --> 00:21:03.441
<v Speaker 1>like trying to understand where like our</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldviews would align where potentially</v>

426
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>there would be opposition between you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I?</v>

427
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think cause it seems to be</v>

428
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:10.640
<v Speaker 1>looking at your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

429
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>oh I don't agree with the way that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information is being compiled.</v>

430
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:14.494
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with the assumptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to saddle that piece of </v>

431
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.033
<v Speaker 1>data with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that it's about critical </v>

432
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking and very post structuralist </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

433
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

434
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.023
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I have noticed is that much of </v>

435
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.683
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of your theories seem to be </v>

436
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:33.930
<v Speaker 1>subsequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

437
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.773
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd to some unpleasant ideas around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of tradition and </v>

438
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression even.</v>

439
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause like,</v>

440
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would be like,</v>

441
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it'd be well easy for you to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have said,</v>

442
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about whether pete was </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender or not.</v>

443
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want no oppressive laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>around language builders.</v>

444
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 1>It'd be easy if you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any,</v>

445
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you say on the news,</v>

446
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 1>fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness,</v>

447
00:21:58.061 --> 00:21:58.894
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mischief somehow in near around the </v>

448
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:05.350
<v Speaker 1>issues such as gender inequality,</v>

449
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.160
<v Speaker 2>mischief and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda,</v>

450
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.013
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that mostly I look at the </v>

451
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.763
<v Speaker 2>political landscape from the perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a informed biologically oriented </v>

452
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:16.804
<v Speaker 2>social scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when people lay out their </v>

453
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 2>particular theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

454
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't sound outdated to me.</v>

455
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Like one example is that the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

456
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:29.374
<v Speaker 2>tends to lay the blame for inequality at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feet of the western hierarchical </v>

457
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:36.460
<v Speaker 2>structure and capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just wrong.</v>

458
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Equality inequality is a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the proper concern of the left,</v>

459
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:42.244
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a proper concern because </v>

460
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:44.644
<v Speaker 2>inequality is a deadly problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way more serious than anything </v>

461
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:48.394
<v Speaker 2>you can blame on capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single society that's ever been </v>

462
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:51.814
<v Speaker 2>studied for as far back as people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to study suffers from the problem </v>

463
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:57.490
<v Speaker 2>with inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

464
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I work with this native American tribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

465
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in northern Vancouver.</v>

466
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member of the tribe actually now </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called the [inaudible] people.</v>

467
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.573
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

468
00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.483
<v Speaker 1>say that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not sort of like I have to say </v>

469
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.520
<v Speaker 1>much qua qua qua qua qua wok.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

470
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

471
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Tough bear for their native language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

472
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Tough one to spell cause I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably with me is would say too many </v>

473
00:23:17.301 --> 00:23:18.134
<v Speaker 1>class</v>

474
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.110
<v Speaker 2>then they're brick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

475
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.003
<v Speaker 2>they're brilliant artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're part of that west coast native </v>

476
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:24.210
<v Speaker 2>tradition of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a great tradition.</v>

477
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

478
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.020
<v Speaker 2>well exaggerated eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

479
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.873
<v Speaker 2>it's Hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a hallucinogenic art in </v>

480
00:23:31.051 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these family,</v>

481
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.250
<v Speaker 2>the animals are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

482
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.610
<v Speaker 2>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

483
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>graphic.</v>

484
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.823
<v Speaker 2>They're very graphically portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say they have large almond eyes </v>

485
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and bright colors and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arts fared beautiful.</v>

486
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 2>The hideout art is probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>

487
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 2>very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Kwakwaka'Wakw is,</v>

488
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.713
<v Speaker 2>is similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they used to have this ceremony </v>

489
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.233
<v Speaker 2>called the potlatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you would do in a potlatch is </v>

490
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.043
<v Speaker 2>usually you have to be comparatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy to have a part latch and you </v>

491
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:01.244
<v Speaker 2>would give away everything you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was their solution to </v>

492
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>inequality because what would happen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the native societies,</v>

493
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:07.934
<v Speaker 2>just like every other society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that as time progressed everything </v>

494
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 2>would become owned by a very small </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people.</v>

495
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's a bad recipe for longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability.</v>

496
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:20.054
<v Speaker 2>So they would have these giant parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would often last weeks where the </v>

497
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>rich would demonstrate their wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

498
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I suppose their commitment to their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>provision,</v>

499
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>their own capacity to provision the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future by giving everything away.</v>

500
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm only using that as an example to</v>

501
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:37.304
<v Speaker 2>show that the problem of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that you can lay at </v>

502
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 2>the feet of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a way worse problem than that.</v>

503
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

504
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.330
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying that</v>

505
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.223
<v Speaker 1>capitalism occurs far too late down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line to be the genesis a problem that's </v>

506
00:24:51.521 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>indigenous to the but what about some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these like,</v>

507
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would be very careful to like the,</v>

508
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

509
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in God,</v>

510
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.043
<v Speaker 1>but like I wouldn't politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be a little more cautious about </v>

511
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:06.544
<v Speaker 1>saying why I agree with this pilot boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I sort of don't feel that my </v>

512
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.843
<v Speaker 1>political views are demonstrated within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sphere of mainstream politics </v>

513
00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:18.530
<v Speaker 1>because they operate on such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibited frequency because of the,</v>

514
00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:19.364
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of Trans National </v>

515
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the irrelevance of national sovereignty </v>

516
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to ordinary people </v>
<v Speaker 1>asserting power.</v>

517
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:26.951
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:25:26.951 --> 00:25:29.350
<v Speaker 1>it becomes sort of kind of too complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

519
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.363
<v Speaker 1>But what I can see is interesting about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know even if you take a sort of </v>

520
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.923
<v Speaker 1>socialism and perhaps you know like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect or sense that one of the </v>

521
00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:43.270
<v Speaker 1>issues you take is it sort of continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation of likes it take first,</v>

522
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.940
<v Speaker 1>take out God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then take out man and take out woman,</v>

523
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 1>then take out everything to all we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this miasma of meaninglessness.</v>

524
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily put that at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

525
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily put it in read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the socialism</v>

526
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.850
<v Speaker 2>per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say that is?</v>

527
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it happening or did it?</v>

528
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Am I wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

529
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.743
<v Speaker 2>I think it's happened in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that is a consequence </v>

530
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 2>of the hypothetical conflict between </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and religion.</v>

531
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's hypothetical?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would be,</v>

532
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not so sure there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

533
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:15.723
<v Speaker 2>There will look their materialism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual fundamental conflict because </v>

534
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>the world is one thing fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

535
00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Everything fits together so there can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be a conflict.</v>

536
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.000
<v Speaker 2>If the religious realm exists in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific realm exists,</v>

537
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 2>they have to be unifiable at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the more materialistic scientists or</v>

538
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.073
<v Speaker 2>the what the more atheistic scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>types like Sam Harris would deny </v>

539
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.290
<v Speaker 2>essentially that there's any validity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious dogma.</v>

540
00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Although he certainly believes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a element to life.</v>

541
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So I think that what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

542
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 2>and this is why the work of Yom to </v>
<v Speaker 2>return to yoga so important is that we,</v>

543
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 2>we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't understand that truth comes in</v>

544
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 2>different forms depending on its </v>
<v Speaker 2>application.</v>

545
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.423
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the truths that apply when </v>

546
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:05.814
<v Speaker 2>you're attempting to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations of the material world </v>

547
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.533
<v Speaker 2>and there's the truths that apply when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to determine how it is </v>

548
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 2>that you should act while you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

549
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 2>obviously those have to come into </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment,</v>

550
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 2>but they're not in alignment right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my sense,</v>

551
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:20.814
<v Speaker 2>and this is the sense that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed at least in part from reading </v>

552
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 2>the great psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that fictional accounts,</v>

553
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Mehta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fictional accounts,</v>

554
00:27:29.221 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 2>even like biblical comps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are mythological our stories about</v>

555
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:33.474
<v Speaker 2>how it is that people should act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Stories about what the material </v>

556
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:37.584
<v Speaker 2>structure of the world is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also where the fundamentalists </v>

557
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:41.154
<v Speaker 2>have it wrong as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the fundamentalists like to </v>

558
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:44.604
<v Speaker 2>think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the account in genesis is a scientific </v>

559
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:48.954
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be stacked up against other </v>

560
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 2>scientific theory.</v>

561
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 2>She'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are materializing the mythic.</v>

562
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

563
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 2>And this says I'm helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

564
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:56.281
<v Speaker 2>it's not a help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

565
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

566
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.263
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even make any sense because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the materialist types in any real sense </v>

567
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 2>weren't around until about 500 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

568
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:05.904
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was all satisfy like cart and </v>

569
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.690
<v Speaker 2>the cart and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

570
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacon and,</v>

571
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galileo was another player,</v>

572
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:14.034
<v Speaker 2>but those were the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two major players established the </v>

573
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:19.380
<v Speaker 2>scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There weren't scientists before then.</v>

574
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were very intelligent people who </v>

575
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 2>could analyze the structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

576
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 2>The ancient Greeks were obviously very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational and capable of philosophy,</v>

577
00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 2>but there was no science until 500 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

578
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 2>And so obviously the people who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis word scientists,</v>

579
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>because there weren't any scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whatever.</v>

580
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.500
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world they describe is much more,</v>

581
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.993
<v Speaker 2>it's much better considered the world of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience than the world of material </v>

582
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

583
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look here,</v>

584
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>here's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

585
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can try this one on for size.</v>

586
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying this on audiences for </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a long time.</v>

587
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.170
<v Speaker 2>So modern people say they think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is made out of things,</v>

588
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.830
<v Speaker 2>but if you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how they act.</v>

589
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>They act like the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

590
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll even say things to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other like,</v>

591
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.840
<v Speaker 2>you're not living up to your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

592
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:10.674
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this potential that you're </v>

593
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

594
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a shape.</v>

595
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have a size.</v>

596
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing about it that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a material,</v>

597
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.183
<v Speaker 2>a material element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet you believe that you're not living </v>

598
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 2>up to your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone feels guilty about that.</v>

599
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:31.620
<v Speaker 2>If someone accuses you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that you feel bad about it.</v>

600
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So then I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

601
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>you also live not as if you confront a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of things,</v>

602
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:36.294
<v Speaker 2>but as if you confront a world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility and you hold each other </v>

603
00:29:39.181 --> 00:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>accountable that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I could say,</v>

604
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:41.604
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not making all the use of the </v>

605
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 2>possibility that's presented to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not living,</v>

606
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 2>you're not living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

607
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.573
<v Speaker 2>You're not aiming high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not making everything of that </v>

608
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 2>potential that might be made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's that potential?</v>

609
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in religious stories,</v>

610
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:56.824
<v Speaker 2>that potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see this in the first story in </v>

611
00:29:58.211 --> 00:29:59.044
<v Speaker 2>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that potential is what God creates </v>

612
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 2>order out of at the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea that's expressed in that</v>

613
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 2>book is that there's a potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>

614
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 2>and that something acts on it to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>it into reality.</v>

615
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>And there's a deeper idea in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

616
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a profound idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the potential,</v>

617
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the actuality that you bring out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential with truth is good.</v>

618
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.200
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an ethical element to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story as well.</v>

619
00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great truth.</v>

620
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:30.754
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the reality you bring out of </v>

621
00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 2>potential with truth is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the most,</v>

622
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the most profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>discoveries of humanity.</v>

623
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.823
<v Speaker 2>The ability to articulate that idea was </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated in the first chapter in </v>

624
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:45.874
<v Speaker 2>Genesis to brilliant idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the idea that human </v>

625
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:50.164
<v Speaker 2>beings are made in the image of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>because God is that which calls reality </v>

626
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:56.644
<v Speaker 2>into being out of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But each of us do that as well in a </v>

627
00:30:58.631 --> 00:31:01.470
<v Speaker 2>small way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to just be true.</v>

628
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.393
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are in the manifest </v>

629
00:31:03.601 --> 00:31:05.130
<v Speaker 1>world where once unmanifest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

630
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.353
<v Speaker 1>and many of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmanifest now will become manifest and </v>

631
00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:11.370
<v Speaker 1>we could choose that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have agency.</v>

632
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seem to treat each other like</v>

633
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.701
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

634
00:31:14.701 --> 00:31:15.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:31:15.511 --> 00:31:17.490
<v Speaker 2>if I treat you like you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>agency,</v>

636
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.280
<v Speaker 2>you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the grounds for a,</v>

637
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>for a satisfactory longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

638
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.063
<v Speaker 1>While we were in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you something because you </v>

639
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>want to pick a job that seems right up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your alley.</v>

640
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I looked at this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember about any more.</v>

641
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 1>You may even know specs that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>

642
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.073
<v Speaker 1>it was a book of engravings from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Book of job by the British writer and </v>

643
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.053
<v Speaker 1>poet William Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blake had done the series of engravings </v>

644
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 1>based on the trials and tests that Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through in these,</v>

645
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:48.080
<v Speaker 1>in these series of engravings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourway and Joe,</v>

646
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all way and joe are depicted as a sort</v>

647
00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 1>of identical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:54.544
<v Speaker 1>the ones in a celestial realm once in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial realm and the beginning of </v>

649
00:31:57.881 --> 00:31:58.714
<v Speaker 1>the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Joe and his family are depicted in </v>

650
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>front of the tree of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instruments hanging in the trees.</v>

651
00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:08.110
<v Speaker 1>The animals are sleeping by the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image after these various trials,</v>

652
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Joe has been tested this,</v>

653
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>and we were to assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that there's been this journey</v>

654
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 1>of self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital s realization.</v>

655
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

656
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through these trials,</v>

657
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

658
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the instruments are being played to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are awake,</v>

659
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a sort of a bright future in</v>

660
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:23.644
<v Speaker 1>this sense of astronomical stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 1>either position in at the sun and moon </v>

661
00:32:26.051 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 1>is somehow meant to be significant also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person that wrote this book,</v>

662
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 1>he's a union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

663
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 1>the thing that struck me deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

664
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:32.134
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been struggling with it ever </v>

665
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:34.234
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's a moment where Yar way shows </v>

666
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the behemoth and the to job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

667
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 1>these I made is I made the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in this union analysis of these</v>

668
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:50.711
<v Speaker 1>engravings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer says that God requires of us,</v>

669
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 1>that we be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goodness itself may exist,</v>

670
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.983
<v Speaker 1>that there is a something beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's comparable to neutrality in </v>

671
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Creator,</v>

672
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator,</v>

673
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.013
<v Speaker 1>the image of the behemoth and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leviathan in these engravings is </v>

674
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:11.230
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animalism of the bacchae empathy,</v>

675
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>it's Musculature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its rawness,</v>

676
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 1>the Leviathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaky,</v>

677
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

678
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:17.234
<v Speaker 1>terrifying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea of agency and got this </v>

679
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:22.094
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the unmanifest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifest as achieved through an </v>

680
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:26.834
<v Speaker 1>individual's relationship with truth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression seemed to me that it was </v>

681
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:31.754
<v Speaker 1>saying something that was right on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precipice of my ability to understand </v>

682
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and sandy to convey.</v>

683
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would say as well,</v>

684
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.483
<v Speaker 2>one of the indications that you're open </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the way that you phrased that </v>

685
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.204
<v Speaker 2>question cause there's like 30 things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in that question all at the </v>

686
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:47.444
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that creative </v>

687
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 2>people do is they throw out like images </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cause your,</v>

688
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.240
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your question was full of images.</v>

689
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.093
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to map territory that you </v>

690
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:57.344
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say here's an image and here's an </v>

691
00:33:58.281 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 2>image and here's the new bridge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an image.</v>

692
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's something uniting all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

693
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:03.050
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

694
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.943
<v Speaker 2>well that's what artists do by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a preliminary mapping of </v>

695
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:09.800
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we could take that apart a little</v>

696
00:34:09.801 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

697
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.413
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so joe is objecting to his treatment </v>

698
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 2>because of course God has a bet with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>devil basically,</v>

699
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 2>that he can take job down and make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>curse fate.</v>

700
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 2>He basically bets the devil that he can </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn job into Kaine and God says,</v>

701
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

702
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:25.993
<v Speaker 2>you God says no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you the devil bets God that he can turn </v>

703
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 2>job indicate by tormenting him and God </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

704
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 2>no jobs a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you do to him,</v>

705
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:37.560
<v Speaker 2>he won't lose faith in being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially the bat.</v>

706
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a hell of a thing for God to</v>

707
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:41.000
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

708
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 2>and job objects to God to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got his reasons,</v>

709
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:45.794
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause everything's taken away </v>

710
00:34:46.881 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 2>from him and God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made these things,</v>

711
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.013
<v Speaker 2>the Leviathan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like the terrible element of </v>

712
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.224
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I made the bay a moth and maybe you </v>

713
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:57.410
<v Speaker 2>could say that's the terrible element of</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

714
00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:58.244
<v Speaker 2>It's like how dare you question me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

715
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 2>objection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like really?</v>

716
00:35:02.631 --> 00:35:04.430
<v Speaker 2>You're good at it doesn't matter what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

717
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you're going to question God really </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

718
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 2>So God objects to that and then and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

719
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

720
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.853
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although job young believed that job </v>

721
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:14.783
<v Speaker 2>actually had the moral upper hand in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that description because God behaved </v>

722
00:35:17.101 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 2>rather reprehensive Lee and having a bet</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the devil.</v>

723
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean young wrote a book called answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to job,</v>

724
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 2>which is very much worth reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite a profound piece of work.</v>

725
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.143
<v Speaker 2>But then you also woven into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question this idea of the ethical </v>

726
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:31.930
<v Speaker 2>requirement to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

727
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>there's something in that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unutterably deep because this is,</v>

728
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 2>this is right at the limit of my ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand things too.</v>

729
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:39.864
<v Speaker 2>So it's speculative beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that we are thrown </v>

730
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.203
<v Speaker 2>challenges and that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that in some sense those are best </v>

731
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 2>construed as tests of our ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>

732
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.370
<v Speaker 2>So what human thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his idea,</v>

733
00:35:54.371 --> 00:35:55.204
<v Speaker 2>it was something like this that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time people were </v>

734
00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:02.100
<v Speaker 2>unconscious and that consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge with all of its catastrophes,</v>

735
00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 2>consciousness of death for example.</v>

736
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.063
<v Speaker 2>And one way out of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness was to return to </v>

737
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with alcohol.</v>

738
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do that by being dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that by failing to grow up.</v>

739
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 2>You refuse the burden of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>by becoming unconscious again.</v>

740
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>But there's another way for which is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become even more conscious.</v>

741
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>So the idea would be a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is like an illness,</v>

742
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.240
<v Speaker 2>but if you can expand that consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>upwards enough,</v>

743
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:31.074
<v Speaker 2>then it's stumps something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts to become something that it's </v>

744
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:33.924
<v Speaker 2>all that is its own cure and that partly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your goal is while you suffer </v>

745
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:40.164
<v Speaker 2>through life is to heighten your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to the point where </v>

746
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:42.924
<v Speaker 2>everything gets integrated enough so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's proper medication for the </v>

747
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:47.394
<v Speaker 2>disease of self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't believe that that was </v>

748
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.113
<v Speaker 2>really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the ideas that ran </v>

749
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 2>through the entire while the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of Judeo Christianity,</v>

750
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 2>although not it wouldn't be limited to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaeo Christianity.</v>

751
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.473
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more consciousness rather than </v>

752
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more attention and I,</v>

753
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.933
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something to that and </v>

754
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 2>some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>

755
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 2>The other thing you see in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy,</v>

756
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:11.064
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when you're trying to lead </v>

757
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:14.094
<v Speaker 2>people forward out of the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say out of anxiety and depression </v>

758
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:18.624
<v Speaker 2>and despair and resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitterness and anger and all of those </v>

759
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:21.954
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic interactions with their </v>

760
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:25.134
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you get them to stop avoiding </v>

761
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 2>confronting the terrible things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of them,</v>

762
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you do,</v>

763
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

764
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:36.360
<v Speaker 2>all those terrible things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

765
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 2>just ignore those and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

766
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 2>and find some peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

767
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Get your mind away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what you say you say,</v>

768
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 2>turn around and look at them even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you've been looking at them.</v>

769
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:46.723
<v Speaker 2>It was a very paradoxical advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of all the things that have been </v>

770
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:54.951
<v Speaker 2>proven to aid people's recovery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement towards mental health,</v>

771
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:56.904
<v Speaker 2>that's like at the top of the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary confrontation with what you </v>

772
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.043
<v Speaker 2>are afraid of or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what you despise even for that </v>

773
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

774
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 2>And so young had an axiom that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>derived from the alchemist,</v>

775
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>which was in stir curliness infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>tour,</v>

776
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:10.794
<v Speaker 2>which meant roughly meant that which you</v>
<v Speaker 2>most need will be found where you least </v>

777
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:17.090
<v Speaker 2>want to look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fun.</v>

778
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's hit.</v>

779
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:19.644
<v Speaker 2>I was also his explanation for why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people weren't enlightened because you </v>

780
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:23.664
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

781
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 2>the California approach to enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak,</v>

782
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of satirically is follow your </v>

783
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:28.980
<v Speaker 2>bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

784
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>well that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was the case,</v>

785
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:33.290
<v Speaker 2>everyone would be enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the union approaches,</v>

786
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:33.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

787
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:34.494
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do what's meaningful and pay </v>

788
00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the truth and it will take you to</v>

789
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:39.214
<v Speaker 2>the worst place you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe there's some chance for </v>

790
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:42.754
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

791
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Campbell somewhat revoked that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I follow your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

793
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.220
<v Speaker 1>mantra though by saying he wish he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>said follow your blisters.</v>

794
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of these,</v>

795
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.610
<v Speaker 1>the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

796
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he said that.</v>

797
00:38:55.921 --> 00:38:56.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool,</v>

798
00:38:56.361 --> 00:38:57.020
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

799
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.980
<v Speaker 1>The kids pull out on the scoreboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

800
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.210
<v Speaker 1>That's like a novel thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

801
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.093
<v Speaker 1>now I've been framed because you've said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I said something that you didn't </v>

802
00:39:04.861 --> 00:39:05.694
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's unraveled my entire veltin </v>

803
00:39:07.651 --> 00:39:09.690
<v Speaker 1>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I've reached for a bit of German</v>

804
00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:11.640
<v Speaker 1>language to pull my way back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

805
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Heard and Melville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll help me out.</v>

806
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Like so like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading this moby Dick,</v>

807
00:39:15.571 --> 00:39:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it smashed my head up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:18.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

809
00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:20.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he says in the,</v>

810
00:39:20.821 --> 00:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of the book I have,</v>

811
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:25.280
<v Speaker 1>when he's hanging out with pip and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

812
00:39:25.281 --> 00:39:26.970
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's really losing it now,</v>

813
00:39:26.971 --> 00:39:29.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he's finding it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a bit weak.</v>

814
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.820
<v Speaker 1>He talks about will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is it that move this arm?</v>

815
00:39:32.821 --> 00:39:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is it that think disease thoughts?</v>

816
00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:38.520
<v Speaker 1>If the mighty son has no control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>its movements,</v>

817
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.340
<v Speaker 1>what control is Ahab over his thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

818
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.340
<v Speaker 1>in talking about fate and destiny and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>

819
00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:46.830
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to me very potent,</v>

820
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.680
<v Speaker 1>powerful themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

821
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.543
<v Speaker 1>the petitioner</v>

822
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.010
<v Speaker 2>with a great whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

823
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the dragon of the abyss.</v>

824
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.040
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Moby Dick.</v>

825
00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:55.874
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the hero against the dragon of the </v>

826
00:39:57.651 --> 00:39:59.540
<v Speaker 2>abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's obsessed with it.</v>

827
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.301
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

828
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:01.710
<v Speaker 2>he shouldn't be obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

829
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.553
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what to be obsessed with is the </v>

830
00:40:03.861 --> 00:40:04.694
<v Speaker 2>dragon of the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the oldest story of mankind is </v>

831
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:09.980
<v Speaker 2>that your proper obsession is the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the abyss.</v>

832
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.060
<v Speaker 2>That's where the gold is.</v>

833
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the gold is.</v>

834
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's where things are most</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified,</v>

835
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.193
<v Speaker 1>bloody tragic ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that you take Ishmael is the </v>

836
00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:19.860
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you should mount survives.</v>

837
00:40:19.861 --> 00:40:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

838
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.360
<v Speaker 1>done a ruin it for anyone dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

839
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a tragedy.</v>

840
00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:27.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a tragic encounter with the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos.</v>

841
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a failed hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamental outcomes.</v>

842
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's gay.</v>

843
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Lost that limb and stuff and I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

844
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:34.014
<v Speaker 1>sort of a symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Captain Hook and the </v>

845
00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.350
<v Speaker 1>crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a half the ha.</v>

846
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

847
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 1>for me it's very exciting when I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>these patterns of preventing Elysium.</v>

848
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.480
<v Speaker 1>For me it is exciting because this tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the implicit energy and implicit in</v>

849
00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:47.190
<v Speaker 1>his truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that thing we were talking about</v>

850
00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:48.024
<v Speaker 1>a minute ago where we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got excited because I said fully your </v>

851
00:40:49.671 --> 00:40:51.420
<v Speaker 1>blisters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field's going to say is like that.</v>

852
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So some sort of maximize understand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism of like let it burn,</v>

853
00:40:55.321 --> 00:40:58.020
<v Speaker 1>let it burn and burn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like take away from me everything.</v>

854
00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

855
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh there's the idea is also</v>

856
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 2>there in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no cult interpretation.</v>

857
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:06.750
<v Speaker 2>There's letters on Christ's cross Inri </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

858
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.240
<v Speaker 2>It means Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>King of the Jews.</v>

859
00:41:09.241 --> 00:41:10.074
<v Speaker 2>And it was put there by the Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no cult interpretation in </v>

860
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I can re re reproduced,</v>

861
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.520
<v Speaker 2>but it means through fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things are renewed.</v>

862
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the deepest ideas of Christianity</v>

863
00:41:20.821 --> 00:41:21.654
<v Speaker 2>is that you should burn everything off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of you that isn't part of </v>

864
00:41:25.081 --> 00:41:25.914
<v Speaker 2>that thing that can die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's all sorts of baggage that </v>

865
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 2>people say that there's baggage that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're carrying.</v>

866
00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that it's deadwood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that to burn off.</v>

867
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's way more of you than you think.</v>

868
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way More than you think.</v>

869
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Whilst you still haven't said whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you believe in God,</v>

870
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and I won't keep going on about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not one of them.</v>

871
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 3>People see what the means to do that.</v>

872
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

873
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.803
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that you revere truth at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that you are interested </v>

874
00:41:54.451 --> 00:41:55.284
<v Speaker 1>in the truth in scripture and mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now then what this leads me to is </v>

875
00:42:00.061 --> 00:42:00.894
<v Speaker 1>something we've touched upon briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the role of power and the </v>

876
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.250
<v Speaker 1>function of morality and ethics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

877
00:42:08.251 --> 00:42:09.084
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed simpler ideas that will have </v>

878
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:14.070
<v Speaker 1>terms if not ideas such as compassion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goodness.</v>

879
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So when like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.183
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>written sort of an accessible sort of </v>

881
00:42:19.081 --> 00:42:20.760
<v Speaker 1>self help type book that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:22.200
<v Speaker 1>clean your room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up straight,</v>

883
00:42:22.201 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 1>stick your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that,</v>

884
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would not query there.</v>

885
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.340
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I feel like I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to ask you about because my,</v>

886
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I even have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituency,</v>

887
00:42:31.231 --> 00:42:32.190
<v Speaker 1>but the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that,</v>

888
00:42:32.191 --> 00:42:33.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself talking a lot to Muslim </v>

889
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:35.880
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

890
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.520
<v Speaker 1>young women's self harming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating disorders,</v>

891
00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:40.360
<v Speaker 1>these kind of clinical psychology.</v>

892
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.193
<v Speaker 1>So I imagine you have more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to that kind of information and </v>

893
00:42:43.621 --> 00:42:44.454
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of experiences than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this strong feeling that I am </v>

894
00:42:47.911 --> 00:42:51.060
<v Speaker 1>supposed to make myself available for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vulnerable,</v>

895
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.470
<v Speaker 1>for the powerless and for the voiceless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a fine idea.</v>

896
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.040
<v Speaker 1>This is the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how do you do it?</v>

897
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.020
<v Speaker 1>How do huge bloody question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they don't want me interfering</v>

898
00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:03.690
<v Speaker 1>in their lives majority of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

899
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.430
<v Speaker 1>There certainly is that while there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

900
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:09.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a maxim that's often applied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who work in old age homes,</v>

901
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.020
<v Speaker 1>which is never do anything for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>residents that they can do themselves.</v>

902
00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 3>They can't still their own money and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sleeping.</v>

903
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Bobbie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Canadian comedian.</v>

904
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Very funny that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think something that has paid off over</v>

905
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 3>the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

906
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so isn't it?</v>

907
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.220
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the thing about,</v>

908
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the thing about compassion is it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to produce solutions.</v>

909
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Compassion is an unbelievably useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion if you're dealing with six month</v>

910
00:43:36.421 --> 00:43:38.790
<v Speaker 1>old infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always right.</v>

911
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>She's there and also now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a,</v>

912
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taught very</v>

913
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.660
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said it doesn't work.</v>

914
00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:46.980
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

915
00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.900
<v Speaker 1>about what want to say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you said no,</v>

916
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.970
<v Speaker 1>this thing about sort of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the,</v>

917
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 1>as a one off the essential themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about the Christ myth being,</v>

918
00:43:59.251 --> 00:44:00.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of burn away all that cannot be </v>

919
00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:05.370
<v Speaker 1>reborn but bloody hell mate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual language,</v>

920
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.220
<v Speaker 1>all he bangs on about is kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindness,</v>

921
00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:09.031
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

922
00:44:09.031 --> 00:44:09.900
<v Speaker 1>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindness,</v>

923
00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:11.330
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation.</v>

924
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Not In revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a judge in revelation.</v>

925
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:17.190
<v Speaker 1>What and are you still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still taking that is what's books</v>

926
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.053
<v Speaker 1>beyond the gospels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still taking as the word of </v>

927
00:44:19.111 --> 00:44:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:44:20.431 --> 00:44:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking them as part of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corpus of the story.</v>

929
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.353
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason that you thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation was appended to the Bible is </v>

930
00:44:26.821 --> 00:44:27.654
<v Speaker 1>because the Christ in the gospels was </v>
<v Speaker 1>aired two s too much in sense on the </v>

931
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>side of mercy and not enough on the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of judgment.</v>

932
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Because here's the technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a technical reason.</v>

933
00:44:38.171 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we've got one attachment.</v>

934
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

935
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a choice because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an ideal,</v>

936
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:45.144
<v Speaker 1>it's a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have an ideal and there might </v>

937
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:48.144
<v Speaker 1>be an ideal that you have a view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simultaneously your judge because </v>

938
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:51.744
<v Speaker 1>you fall short of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand this cause that's funny </v>

939
00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:54.834
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to the fellow that taught </v>

940
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 1>me meditation yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Roth.</v>

941
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So he's a student of the Maharishi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

942
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 1>He said that when Maharishi was asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the one principal,</v>

943
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.313
<v Speaker 1>the one principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say kindness or compassion or </v>

944
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:06.804
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

945
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 1>discernment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discernment,</v>

946
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 1>and which path are we going to follow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their attention,</v>

947
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 1>guarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but judgment.</v>

948
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.423
<v Speaker 1>That's why in revelation Christ divides </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damned from the saved and most of </v>

949
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:19.224
<v Speaker 1>the damned bitch discernment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in some sense is </v>

950
00:45:21.941 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 1>that there's a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 100,000</v>

951
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>ways to do things wrong and only one way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do them right.</v>

952
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe only five ways of doing them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

953
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 1>But you know that in your own life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

954
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.513
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

955
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.473
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of snares </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can tangle yourself up in and </v>

956
00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 1>to find that pathway where everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>

957
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.133
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires continual discernment at </v>

958
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:43.280
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

959
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't have an ideal without it being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a judge and you can't,</v>

960
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't live property without </v>
<v Speaker 1>discernment.</v>

961
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean compassion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion isn't relevant.</v>

962
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:53.874
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy ask you something that sort of </v>

963
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>occurs to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

964
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like you,</v>

965
00:45:58.231 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I found myself in different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial situations,</v>

966
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 1>various conflict and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the time is because,</v>

967
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Albert maysles said,</v>

968
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 1>tyranny is the deliberate removal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance.</v>

969
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>People remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even say that.</v>

970
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a good phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good shit,</v>

971
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:14.004
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

972
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.610
<v Speaker 1>But like the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

973
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Deliberate removal of a new audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

974
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.513
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes it different than </v>

975
00:46:20.191 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>ignorance because ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no nuance and ignorance,</v>

976
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's excusable because you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know any better.</v>

977
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But when it's deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different story.</v>

978
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.313
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who said the album mays was filmmaker </v>

979
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 1>who made like grey gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made that be,</v>

980
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I did a documentary with him very </v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly and he uh,</v>

981
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 1>he made that Beatles movie when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatles first came to the states.</v>

982
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 1>He made gimme shelter as the maze was </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably that I like old guys now.</v>

983
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant Documentarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uneasy.</v>

984
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:43.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm crew here and nodding the approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invented much of the fly on the wall </v>

985
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>verite style that's informed subsequent </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary tyrannies that deliver it.</v>

986
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:51.174
<v Speaker 1>Removal of nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him sort of briefly </v>

987
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>filming none other than President Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump of all people.</v>

988
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But like one of the things that I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about was,</v>

989
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I like this is the thing,</v>

990
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't like all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the,</v>

991
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I agree and I or I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you feel that,</v>

992
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.840
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the,</v>

993
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.823
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neo liberalism abandoned its </v>

994
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:12.144
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to and leftist politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has in a sense abandoned the working </v>

995
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:18.690
<v Speaker 1>class and I can understand their rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

996
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.900
<v Speaker 1>but the feeling I personally have is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

997
00:47:21.901 --> 00:47:22.734
<v Speaker 1>if I sense that I'd said things and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done this so I know that have offended </v>

998
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:26.341
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

999
00:47:26.341 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was more,</v>

1000
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 1>when I was a single person that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous,</v>

1001
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I know that that course be comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression and conflict.</v>

1002
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Or when I've done things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 1>in the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few mother of cat,</v>

1004
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 1>like a kickback.</v>

1005
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I feel like I've offended people,</v>

1006
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:47.500
<v Speaker 1>the I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would regard or culturally or regarded</v>

1007
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 1>as vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1008
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So like around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1009
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.613
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we make the conversation about the </v>

1010
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 1>use of language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and oppression in free speech,</v>

1011
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I agree with you,</v>

1012
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do take from,</v>

1013
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gospel version of Christ,</v>

1014
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the idea that kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

1015
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:08.943
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to continue to find resources </v>

1016
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:13.084
<v Speaker 1>for ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I will continue to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we must continue to be loving.</v>

1018
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is,</v>

1019
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:18.034
<v Speaker 1>is if you are found herself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where I kind of think some </v>

1020
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:21.124
<v Speaker 1>people were using you to sort of say </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you women or fucking you </v>

1021
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 1>transgender people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me I think I would want to still</v>

1022
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not my bag.</v>

1023
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 1>So where do you stand on that?</v>

1024
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1025
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.063
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all we'll go to the most </v>

1026
00:48:38.961 --> 00:48:42.170
<v Speaker 2>fundamental part of the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this issue about love.</v>

1027
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:43.004
<v Speaker 2>Then like one of the things I've thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a fair bit is the meaning of the </v>

1028
00:48:48.951 --> 00:48:51.830
<v Speaker 2>sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I can tell,</v>

1029
00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1030
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.780
<v Speaker 2>it's basically a two part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's two part wisdom.</v>

1031
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.040
<v Speaker 2>The first is that you should aim at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest good that you can imagine.</v>

1032
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.950
<v Speaker 2>And that would be a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that includes everyone,</v>

1033
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I wanted what was good for you,</v>

1034
00:49:06.651 --> 00:49:07.484
<v Speaker 2>say if I genuinely wanted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted in a way that was good for you </v>

1035
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.473
<v Speaker 2>now and good in the long run and good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and your family and your </v>

1036
00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:15.770
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe good for me too.</v>

1037
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.633
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could conceive of that as the desire </v>

1038
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:22.100
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a good definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>love is that you actually want the best,</v>

1039
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.140
<v Speaker 2>you want the best possible outcome.</v>

1040
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And in the Gospels of course that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extended even to your enemies.</v>

1041
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.101
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1042
00:49:28.101 --> 00:49:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay if we're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>things good,</v>

1043
00:49:29.961 --> 00:49:30.794
<v Speaker 2>let's have a good enough for even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that set themselves up against </v>

1044
00:49:33.651 --> 00:49:34.484
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if the world was running </v>

1045
00:49:35.511 --> 00:49:36.344
<v Speaker 2>property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things would be good for them too and </v>

1046
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:38.894
<v Speaker 2>that would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that that's a very </v>

1047
00:49:40.581 --> 00:49:41.414
<v Speaker 2>good way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a difficult way of looking at </v>

1048
00:49:43.011 --> 00:49:43.844
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second part of the sermon </v>

1049
00:49:45.831 --> 00:49:49.910
<v Speaker 2>on the mount is something like having </v>
<v Speaker 2>established that as your aim,</v>

1050
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.530
<v Speaker 2>which is no easy thing by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1051
00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.364
<v Speaker 2>Because you have to be pretty clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed and single minded to actually </v>

1052
00:49:55.401 --> 00:49:56.234
<v Speaker 2>want that to be rain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can concentrate on the day and </v>

1053
00:49:59.421 --> 00:50:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you can try telling the truth and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can ally.</v>

1054
00:50:02.121 --> 00:50:04.550
<v Speaker 2>So there's truth and love that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>allied together.</v>

1055
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love and attention.</v>

1056
00:50:05.871 --> 00:50:08.000
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that that are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>allied together.</v>

1057
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:09.283
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to transgressing against </v>

1058
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:12.524
<v Speaker 2>the vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that is what I've </v>

1059
00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:17.120
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people have claimed that,</v>

1060
00:50:17.121 --> 00:50:18.830
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1061
00:50:18.831 --> 00:50:19.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1062
00:50:19.611 --> 00:50:24.611
<v Speaker 2>I know absolutely that I have brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps thousands of people,</v>

1063
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.253
<v Speaker 2>maybe tens of thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly thousands of people away </v>

1064
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.773
<v Speaker 2>from identification with the right cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>they write me all the time and tell me </v>

1065
00:50:33.811 --> 00:50:34.644
<v Speaker 2>that I've received about 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>letters specifically from people who've </v>

1066
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:42.000
<v Speaker 2>been watching my youtube videos since </v>
<v Speaker 2>August and 25,000</v>

1067
00:50:42.001 --> 00:50:42.834
<v Speaker 2>of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've tried to count are from people </v>

1068
00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:45.624
<v Speaker 2>who said that they were in very dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and that their lives are much </v>

1069
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.793
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much oriented towards truth and </v>

1070
00:50:51.871 --> 00:50:54.660
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and a wave from political</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

1071
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.160
<v Speaker 2>mostly on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1072
00:50:56.161 --> 00:50:57.390
<v Speaker 2>That they were attracted on the right.</v>

1073
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Because I have more people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1074
00:50:58.981 --> 00:50:59.814
<v Speaker 2>Me Than people who say that I say </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescued them from the hell holes of the </v>

1075
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.160
<v Speaker 2>radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1076
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more of a historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident and some in some in some whites</v>

1077
00:51:11.131 --> 00:51:12.330
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything else.</v>

1078
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.540
<v Speaker 2>And but also with the transgender issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more specifically,</v>

1079
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I've received now at least 40 letters </v>
<v Speaker 2>from transgender people and the only one</v>

1080
00:51:20.461 --> 00:51:22.830
<v Speaker 2>of them was critical and it wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical.</v>

1081
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.760
<v Speaker 2>The rest of them all said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1082
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.400
<v Speaker 2>we never signed up to be poster boy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the year for the radical left.</v>

1083
00:51:29.401 --> 00:51:30.090
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1084
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.280
<v Speaker 2>it's been no picnic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>

1085
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:35.310
<v Speaker 2>All that's happened is that our lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>have become much more difficult.</v>

1086
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that and I don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the mistakes that the,</v>

1087
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.513
<v Speaker 2>the radical left makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is part and parcel of their </v>

1088
00:51:42.631 --> 00:51:47.370
<v Speaker 2>flirtation with identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they fall all over themselves to</v>

1089
00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:51.000
<v Speaker 2>believe that if a person identifies as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority,</v>

1090
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.480
<v Speaker 2>then they immediately have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak for all the people who are in that</v>

1091
00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:55.314
<v Speaker 2>minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a claim that I reject </v>

1092
00:51:57.451 --> 00:51:58.800
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1093
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.740
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no transgender community.</v>

1094
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:02.723
<v Speaker 2>It's not a community because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community is constantly interacting and </v>

1095
00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:06.144
<v Speaker 2>networking and has a shared purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And old out transgender people are just </v>

1096
00:52:08.911 --> 00:52:11.130
<v Speaker 2>as diverse as any other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like saying,</v>

1097
00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:13.380
<v Speaker 2>well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real black community,</v>

1098
00:52:13.381 --> 00:52:16.860
<v Speaker 2>there's not homogenous political </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints across the black population.</v>

1099
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree to appoint the,</v>

1100
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.663
<v Speaker 1>these taxonomies are necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>externally imposed because how would </v>

1101
00:52:24.691 --> 00:52:27.780
<v Speaker 1>they be intrinsically experienced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

1102
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.033
<v Speaker 1>But also it seems to me that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called the experience of being an </v>

1103
00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:34.554
<v Speaker 1>African American and you can put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that high prison populations for young </v>

1104
00:52:38.701 --> 00:52:39.534
<v Speaker 1>males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of educational opportunity or work </v>

1105
00:52:43.051 --> 00:52:46.410
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that day is available for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1106
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So while community may be an incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>

1107
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.433
<v Speaker 1>literally there is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a straw that seem to be </v>

1108
00:52:55.021 --> 00:52:56.850
<v Speaker 1>underserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another concern I would have about,</v>

1109
00:52:56.851 --> 00:52:59.960
<v Speaker 1>so some of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the re-purposing,</v>

1110
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:00.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as far as we know so far or have </v>

1111
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.863
<v Speaker 1>much of your arbitrary on online work </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that it supports the </v>

1112
00:53:09.601 --> 00:53:12.540
<v Speaker 1>powerful is a ports hedge money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1113
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree that things are as simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>as white men.</v>

1114
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to pat and let you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:53:17.071 --> 00:53:17.904
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm only interested in who is able </v>

1116
00:53:20.521 --> 00:53:21.450
<v Speaker 1>to effect change.</v>

1117
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Who is able to influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can you not attack in public?</v>

1118
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 1>What is possibly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is being controlled?</v>

1119
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what interests me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in a transnational corporations,</v>

1120
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>economic elites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1121
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:33.024
<v Speaker 1>like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how are they serve by what I say or </v>

1122
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>by what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1123
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reference back to the existence</v>

1124
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:40.584
<v Speaker 1>of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We agreed or inequality back to that </v>

1125
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:43.683
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1126
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it's natural,</v>

1127
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:45.774
<v Speaker 1>which clearly it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot leave it at the feet of </v>

1128
00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely clear.</v>

1129
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.520
<v Speaker 1>That and the fact that it's naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>though capitalism,</v>

1130
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.870
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism doesn't help.</v>

1131
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.700
<v Speaker 1>There's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a Marxist critique,</v>

1132
00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:57.534
<v Speaker 1>what I understand that it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism is built on limitless growth </v>

1133
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.510
<v Speaker 1>from finite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from finite resources.</v>

1134
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:04.403
<v Speaker 1>And also capitalism will always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always be redirected and criminally </v>

1135
00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:09.174
<v Speaker 1>misused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1136
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and they're sort of the economics of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1137
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It sort of for me is demonstrable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know stuff.</v>

1138
00:54:13.741 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>There are people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1139
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 1>people are richer now than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1140
00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:17.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in La for a while and there's </v>

1141
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 1>90,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless people in the Greater La area,</v>

1142
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems like some sort of like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse is creeping in.</v>

1143
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 1>People are richer than they ever have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

1144
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but the extreme extremes of inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>are high too.</v>

1145
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And there's some evidence that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some evidence.</v>

1146
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.563
<v Speaker 1>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example of how these things </v>

1147
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 1>might work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that people,</v>

1148
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.600
<v Speaker 1>that people are getting richer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely no doubt about that.</v>

1149
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:40.800
<v Speaker 1>But here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we got.</v>

1150
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:42.100
<v Speaker 1>More stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though like,</v>

1151
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you would agree that carving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what starving,</v>

1152
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obesity is a bigger problem in the world</v>

1153
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:49.050
<v Speaker 1>now than starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

1154
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a big plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the way it still implies that</v>

1155
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>people are being underserved by the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their operating systems.</v>

1156
00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no doubt about that.</v>

1157
00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's still in first inequality also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1158
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:01.763
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that any social system </v>

1159
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>has a tyrannical and arbitrary aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1160
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.350
<v Speaker 1>that's an architectural training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1161
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Any of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even now,</v>

1162
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 1>even well functioning systems have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical aspect.</v>

1163
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Not mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least merely because they're more </v>

1164
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.280
<v Speaker 1>native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who your gown.</v>

1165
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:22.123
<v Speaker 1>We've not native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native Canadians that the Kwakwaka'wakw </v>

1166
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 1>then guys like how's their social system</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up?</v>

1167
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on.</v>

1168
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh well I mean it's a catastrophe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of reasons.</v>

1169
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.893
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1171
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:38.323
<v Speaker 1>The situation is very catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you mainly because well the reserve </v>

1172
00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:41.964
<v Speaker 1>system was set up in Canada and it had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of working when there was a </v>

1173
00:55:45.691 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 1>possibility that small communities could</v>
<v Speaker 1>work economically.</v>

1174
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 1>But small communities don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically anymore.</v>

1175
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go through Saskatchewan for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1176
00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 1>or central province in Canada in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1960s there were thousands and thousands</v>

1177
00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>of small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly Caucasian.</v>

1178
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.950
<v Speaker 1>That is because of their dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism.</v>

1179
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it's not.</v>

1180
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deeper than that.</v>

1181
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the same prop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here's,</v>

1182
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it might be deeper than it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in its current form it is company.</v>

1183
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:10.434
<v Speaker 1>Cause I would agree that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is capitalism a manifestation of </v>

1184
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:14.420
<v Speaker 1>greed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1185
00:56:14.421 --> 00:56:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1186
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same thing has happened all over</v>

1187
00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:18.954
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like urbanization is taking places a </v>

1188
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 1>tremendously rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the culture is or</v>

1189
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the form of government.</v>

1190
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 2>So you think that the politics is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at a lower level.</v>

1191
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 2>The phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the,</v>

1192
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.300
<v Speaker 2>where the significant is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha is a bigger time.</v>

1193
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.403
<v Speaker 2>And within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political systems are just learning </v>

1194
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:36.750
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean we shouldn't.</v>

1195
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 2>That's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the ones we have in search a fairer,</v>

1196
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 2>more just better ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If typically,</v>

1197
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:47.011
<v Speaker 2>if they are empirically not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a way to reliably flattened</v>

1198
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a good thing.</v>

1199
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But the empirical evidence suggests so </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things it suggests.</v>

1200
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.370
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the,</v>

1201
00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.760
<v Speaker 2>at the attempts to alleviate inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last 200 years,</v>

1202
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.633
<v Speaker 2>whether there were left wing governments</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power or right when governments are </v>

1203
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 2>made absolutely no difference whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the degree of inequality,</v>

1204
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.433
<v Speaker 2>the only things that have been reliably </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated to flatten out inequality </v>

1205
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 2>are catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>

1206
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 2>revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemics.</v>

1207
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one other war revolution </v>

1208
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:23.140
<v Speaker 2>epidemics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1209
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be some kind of holsman </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1210
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts right.</v>

1211
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's another horsemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't remember which it is,</v>

1212
00:57:28.061 --> 00:57:28.894
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at a price of the price of radical </v>

1213
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 2>redistribution seems to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 2>There and no one has come up with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because of how power functions.</v>

1215
00:57:38.771 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Because like in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an unequal system,</v>

1216
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.380
<v Speaker 2>whilst there are many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

1217
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:46.060
<v Speaker 2>there are some people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefiting.</v>

1218
00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a tear that benefit from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>current economic situation.</v>

1219
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drive a nice car.</v>

1220
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I have nice house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go where I want.</v>

1221
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at that for a minute.</v>

1222
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:55.744
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about how that happened in </v>

1223
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet I can tell you how it happened.</v>

1224
00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1225
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 2>if this isn't a personal account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Bennett Bay,</v>

1226
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 2>you hadn't assessed in one dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1227
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:07.623
<v Speaker 2>High success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because you were successful in that </v>

1228
00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:09.814
<v Speaker 2>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of opportunities came your </v>

1229
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:13.180
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my suspicions are that where you're</v>

1230
00:58:13.181 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 2>sitting now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have more opportunities than you can</v>

1231
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 2>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that correct?</v>

1232
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1234
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:20.944
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1235
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:21.461
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1236
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:22.294
<v Speaker 2>this is part of what seems to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality is that as you get </v>

1237
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:25.984
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities that come your way </v>

1238
00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 2>start to multiply and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply linearly.</v>

1239
00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 2>They multiply exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you start moving up,</v>

1240
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.730
<v Speaker 2>you start moving up faster and faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>and faster and faster,</v>

1241
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.773
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll hit a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have so many opportunities that you </v>

1242
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:42.760
<v Speaker 2>don't even know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a nonlinear improvement.</v>

1243
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.160
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1244
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 2>the downside of that is you might've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods in your life that were like this</v>

1245
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:49.204
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where let's say you start to get </v>

1246
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:51.484
<v Speaker 2>depressed and then you start to drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're depressed and then you </v>

1247
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:54.964
<v Speaker 2>start to isolate yourself because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and you're depressed and </v>

1248
00:58:56.891 --> 00:58:59.560
<v Speaker 2>because you're drunk and depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your friends start to abandoned you</v>

1249
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.880
<v Speaker 2>and then you lose your job.</v>

1250
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not going downhill in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight line.</v>

1251
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 2>You're going downhill faster and faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>and faster until you fall off a cliff.</v>

1252
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be how the world works</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like there's a center point,</v>

1253
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:13.570
<v Speaker 2>it's unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things improve,</v>

1254
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.433
<v Speaker 2>then they improve exponentially and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things fall and then they fall off </v>

1255
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:17.404
<v Speaker 2>exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be what's driving </v>

1256
00:59:19.091 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start to succeed and the probability</v>

1257
00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 2>that you'll continue to succeed starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to expand.</v>

1258
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.100
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know how to control that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well here,</v>

1259
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:28.963
<v Speaker 2>here's some other examples of it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I said you couldn't lay it at </v>

1260
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 2>the feet of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happens to cities.</v>

1261
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 2>A small proportion of the cities get all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>

1262
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So some cities grow like mad and others </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail catastrophically.</v>

1263
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Detroit,</v>

1264
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.983
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1265
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:47.080
<v Speaker 2>it applies to the massive stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very few stars in the Milky</v>

1266
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Way that have most of the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1267
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 2>So it applies to the height of trees in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1268
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.040
<v Speaker 2>in the jungle.</v>

1269
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.873
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think if things are </v>

1270
00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:59.690
<v Speaker 1>applicable in cosmology and in biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they are,</v>

1271
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.793
<v Speaker 1>their application politically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociologically becomes less relevant </v>

1272
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>because you see these phenomena as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader,</v>

1273
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know me don't keep an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction</v>

1274
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.800
<v Speaker 2>less relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see,</v>

1275
01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the left wingers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic enough about the problem.</v>

1276
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.840
<v Speaker 2>They say inequality is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1277
01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:22.291
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1278
01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I did call is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1279
01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they say,</v>

1280
01:00:26.311 --> 01:00:27.144
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a function of our </v>

1281
01:00:28.051 --> 01:00:30.390
<v Speaker 2>political and economic systems and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could fix those.</v>

1282
01:00:30.391 --> 01:00:31.224
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1283
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not a function of our political and</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic systems,</v>

1284
01:00:33.571 --> 01:00:34.404
<v Speaker 2>or if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at such a deep level that we don't </v>

1285
01:00:35.671 --> 01:00:38.310
<v Speaker 2>know what drives it and we certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to control it.</v>

1286
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but does that not mean Jordan that would</v>

1287
01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you then reject any attempt to auto </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in favor of fairness?</v>

1288
01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me that the focus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like,</v>

1289
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>and as it would be for clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

1290
01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>individual change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's part of my personal experiences</v>

1291
01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.493
<v Speaker 1>without individual change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social change is sort of irrelevant and </v>

1292
01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:57.454
<v Speaker 1>many great gurus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you answered it right then and </v>

1293
01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

1294
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I am concerned with inequality,</v>

1295
01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.240
<v Speaker 2>say saying with social instability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1296
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought about it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1297
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:07.604
<v Speaker 2>I knew that the left wing approaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>tended to fail catastrophic and the </v>

1298
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>right wing of course isn't particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with inequality.</v>

1299
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>So that</v>

1300
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>left wing fails and the right wing don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

1301
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:16.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1302
01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:17.664
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun to see the danger </v>

1303
01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:24.441
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently and the right wing also </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to think that the spoils go to who</v>

1304
01:01:24.661 --> 01:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>deserves the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1305
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not completely true.</v>

1306
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of that because we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>all because of course,</v>

1307
01:01:32.381 --> 01:01:33.214
<v Speaker 1>and what I like from a leftist </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective would be that we're not </v>

1308
01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:36.564
<v Speaker 1>starting with from a level playing field</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the system isn't perfect at </v>

1309
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.853
<v Speaker 1>selected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I think a spiritual </v>

1310
01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:42.684
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that is beneath or </v>

1311
01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>beyond material is the only way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>true progress is likely to be achieved.</v>

1312
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.793
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking if there's something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said before about when we were </v>

1313
01:01:52.471 --> 01:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>talking briefly about kindness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and it occurs to me and this </v>

1314
01:01:55.631 --> 01:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>race program I'm sure very simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the heroism itself,</v>

1315
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.163
<v Speaker 1>by which I mean sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the willingness to sacrifice yourself </v>

1316
01:02:03.871 --> 01:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>for a greater idea.</v>

1317
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.013
<v Speaker 1>What excites me about the idea now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe why the phenomena is so </v>

1318
01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:09.654
<v Speaker 1>loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if someone is willing to die for </v>

1319
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:11.523
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they believe it's bigger than </v>

1320
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>them and in fact that themself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their self is not the truest thing.</v>

1321
01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:17.963
<v Speaker 1>That there is something greater if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will give my life for another person is </v>

1322
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:21.294
<v Speaker 1>almost an acknowledgement of oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The temporal illness of the individual </v>

1323
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:25.764
<v Speaker 1>eight itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all worked so hard to achieve </v>

1324
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:28.464
<v Speaker 1>individuation and I'm sure much of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work as a clinical psychologist who's </v>

1325
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>guiding people towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me it is just a,</v>

1326
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary resting place because having </v>

1327
01:02:36.661 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>had the kind of experiences of personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliation,</v>

1328
01:02:39.151 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

1329
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>failure for decimation here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1330
01:02:43.011 --> 01:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

1331
01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>what I've been led to and what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to struggle with this,</v>

1332
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I serve?</v>

1333
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>How am I of service?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I help her though?</v>

1334
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Do I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the solution to the problem?</v>

1335
01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.104
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the solution to the </v>

1336
01:02:56.891 --> 01:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>problem of inequality is sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's psychological.</v>

1337
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly what I'm</v>

1338
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>dry because it's closer to essence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's my essential,</v>

1339
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.493
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because society has to be a reflection </v>

1340
01:03:08.061 --> 01:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>of individual psyches or collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyches.</v>

1341
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Why is it psychological temptation?</v>

1342
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:15.563
<v Speaker 2>The temptation towards resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction that's associated with </v>

1343
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:23.541
<v Speaker 2>sociological approaches to inequality is</v>
<v Speaker 2>too great and that as a consequence,</v>

1344
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.500
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those movements,</v>

1345
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:29.510
<v Speaker 2>10 inexhaustibly to become corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive began.</v>

1346
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:30.383
<v Speaker 2>I think the orwell put his finger on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he said the middleclass socialists </v>

1347
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:37.620
<v Speaker 2>don't like the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just hate the rich and that hatred.</v>

1348
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that hatred gets the upper hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>in sociological movements.</v>

1349
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that the best approach to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ameliorating inequality is to strengthen</v>

1350
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 2>the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that and that's,</v>

1351
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I've concentrated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what we have this program,</v>

1352
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:51.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self authoring suite and there's a </v>

1353
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:54.624
<v Speaker 2>component of that that helps people </v>
<v Speaker 2>write an autobiography and another </v>

1354
01:03:57.121 --> 01:03:57.954
<v Speaker 2>component that helps them write an </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of their personality and </v>

1355
01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 2>another component that helps them write </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a plan for the future.</v>

1356
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:04.283
<v Speaker 2>And we've used that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've studied the effect of having </v>

1357
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:10.320
<v Speaker 2>people write out a detailed plan for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their future and it's a proper plan.</v>

1358
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.861
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1359
01:04:10.861 --> 01:04:11.694
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1360
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you get to have what you want three to </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years down the road.</v>

1361
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.070
<v Speaker 2>You get to have the friends that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1362
01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 2>You get to have the family you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to have the career,</v>

1363
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:19.014
<v Speaker 2>you want the education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to take care of yourself </v>

1364
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:22.314
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to withstand the temptations of </v>

1365
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:28.050
<v Speaker 2>drug and alcohol abuse and other sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of impulsive pleasures.</v>

1366
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>You get to make productive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful use of your time.</v>

1367
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that look like for you?</v>

1368
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Write it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it look like?</v>

1369
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.323
<v Speaker 2>Do you need a vision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you need another vision of how </v>

1370
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>terrible things could be if you let all </v>
<v Speaker 2>your bad habits get the upper hand.</v>

1371
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:42.683
<v Speaker 2>And we've had people do that in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental situation and most of them </v>

1372
01:04:45.731 --> 01:04:48.300
<v Speaker 2>are college students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the consequences of that,</v>

1373
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 2>there were two consequences.</v>

1374
01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:50.723
<v Speaker 2>One was general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was that university students who </v>

1375
01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:57.390
<v Speaker 2>were about 30% more likely to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and got grades,</v>

1376
01:04:57.391 --> 01:05:01.200
<v Speaker 2>there were were we're about 25% better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a wall of pitting effect,</v>

1377
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.243
<v Speaker 2>but even more interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the coolest thing I think </v>

1378
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:06.040
<v Speaker 2>that we ever discovered us in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1379
01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 2>in our psychological research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did this research in Holland at the,</v>

1380
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1381
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.230
<v Speaker 2>at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Rotterdam School of Management.</v>

1382
01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:17.064
<v Speaker 2>And we ran business students through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program for multiple </v>

1383
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So several thousands of them.</v>

1384
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And we stratified them by gender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity.</v>

1385
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Pretty a pretty rough cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

1386
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:34.081
<v Speaker 2>women and then Dutch nationals and non </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western ethnic minorities.</v>

1387
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.253
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that the performance was like </v>

1388
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dutch women were at the top.</v>

1389
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Then the Dutch men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>

1390
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>then the non Western ethnic minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1391
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>then the non Western ethnic minority men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were behind the Dutch women.</v>

1392
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>

1393
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>They they should about an 80% decrement </v>
<v Speaker 2>in performance.</v>

1394
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:54.993
<v Speaker 2>Really quite catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years after they did the future </v>

1395
01:05:57.491 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were ahead of the Dutch women.</v>

1396
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.023
<v Speaker 2>It just blew us away because it was an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a perfect indication of the fact </v>

1397
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:05.464
<v Speaker 2>that you can use a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention to ameliorate what looks </v>

1398
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 2>like a sociological problem and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the right,</v>

1399
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.690
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the right solution,</v>

1400
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:14.643
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I've been saying over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over in my my lectures and in this </v>

1401
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:17.884
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life and this is why I </v>

1402
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:21.010
<v Speaker 2>think it's become so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1403
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.600
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are right.</v>

1404
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 2>You are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said earlier in the last question,</v>

1405
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.243
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't ignore the group </v>

1406
01:06:28.181 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 2>classification problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's a black experience,</v>

1407
01:06:31.271 --> 01:06:33.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a Latino experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a female experience.</v>

1408
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1409
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:35.703
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to decide what level of </v>

1410
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:38.044
<v Speaker 2>analysis you're going to make primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the primary level of </v>

1411
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:41.944
<v Speaker 2>analysis is the individual and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological rather than the group and </v>

1412
01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:46.174
<v Speaker 2>the sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you put the individual </v>

1413
01:06:48.011 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>level first and then you alluded to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it was,</v>

1414
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it was like an intuition that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing forward,</v>

1415
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:53.824
<v Speaker 2>which was your intuition has been that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right level of progress is made at </v>

1416
01:06:57.341 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 2>the level of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's true.</v>

1417
01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's the end of the level </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I have personal authority and also</v>

1418
01:07:05.871 --> 01:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

1419
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>like here's the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

1420
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Don't recommend any changes that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't suffer for if they failed.</v>

1421
01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.813
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with large scale </v>

1422
01:07:22.431 --> 01:07:23.450
<v Speaker 2>political action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1423
01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how we should change things.</v>

1424
01:07:24.951 --> 01:07:26.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they changed them as well.</v>

1425
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.760
<v Speaker 2>It fails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>

1426
01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not involved in it.</v>

1427
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:34.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like you should be careful when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to change things.</v>

1428
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suffered for your own stupid of </v>

1429
01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:37.311
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1430
01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:38.144
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't bet that that also plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the hands of conservatism because </v>

1431
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.193
<v Speaker 1>you know when you said like that left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing change tends to be sort of </v>

1432
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:46.303
<v Speaker 1>potentially destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These of course these are not just left </v>

1433
01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:50.714
<v Speaker 1>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing radicals to and even not </v>

1434
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1435
01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And also there is sort of conventional </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and the ecological impacts that</v>

1436
01:07:57.651 --> 01:08:00.390
<v Speaker 1>it has the inequality which are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst your setting,</v>

1437
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:01.263
<v Speaker 1>you continued to say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem of inequality is an </v>

1438
01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:04.800
<v Speaker 1>anthropological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1439
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>biological cosmological physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems to really deep problem.</v>

1440
01:08:09.111 --> 01:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It is a deep problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

1441
01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>whenever you get near a problem that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of profundity or ubiquity,</v>

1442
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.243
<v Speaker 1>the solution can only be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to access the transcendent in </v>

1443
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:20.654
<v Speaker 1>some way to look for solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although that sounds a little airy </v>

1444
01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>fairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you believe that?</v>

1445
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disputing that,</v>

1446
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:28.630
<v Speaker 1>but you obviously believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe this.</v>

1447
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what drove you to that conclusion?</v>

1448
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.603
<v Speaker 1>I've been driven to this conclusion by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experiences of personal failure and </v>

1449
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>personal limitation by the failure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuation.</v>

1450
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>By the failure of of my own grandiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the failure of my own ego,</v>

1451
01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:44.714
<v Speaker 1>the failure of fame and power and money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sex and drugs that their inability </v>

1452
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>of them to reach me in the belly of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

1453
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:52.461
<v Speaker 1>Deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

1454
01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>deep down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether Leviathan is this,</v>

1455
01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 1>these cures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this alchemy was redundant.</v>

1456
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.263
<v Speaker 1>And what I have realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's the spiritual journey </v>

1457
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero's journey in like,</v>

1458
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:04.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using reference points in which you </v>

1459
01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:06.914
<v Speaker 1>are an expert and a professor is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the death of the small s self and </v>

1460
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>the realization of the capital s self </v>
<v Speaker 1>means become a servant,</v>

1461
01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:15.914
<v Speaker 1>become a servant of good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your abilities to generate the </v>

1462
01:09:19.581 --> 01:09:20.414
<v Speaker 1>maximum amount of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maximum about of mount of kindness </v>

1463
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 1>and compassion and to be alert to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be of most use.</v>

1464
01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:28.484
<v Speaker 1>Now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be incredibly limited because </v>

1465
01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a deeply egotistical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>

1466
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing individual.</v>

1467
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>But what my focus is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my intention is,</v>

1468
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.124
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to learn to become in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this journey of self realization is a </v>

1469
01:09:40.281 --> 01:09:42.230
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and loving man.</v>

1470
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>So you added something to the tune </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1471
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Well you add useful to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Useful,</v>

1472
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:50.010
<v Speaker 2>not useful as a finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1473
01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:50.844
<v Speaker 2>So the best definition of Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion that I ever read was useful </v>

1474
01:09:54.061 --> 01:09:56.310
<v Speaker 2>and generous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1475
01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Useful and generous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1476
01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say the Conservatives in </v>
<v Speaker 2>air,</v>

1477
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:03.683
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives promote the useful end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the distribution and the liberals pr </v>

1478
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.333
<v Speaker 2>promote the generous set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know things need to be brought to </v>

1479
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1480
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And given that the,</v>

1481
01:10:12.571 --> 01:10:13.404
<v Speaker 1>you yourself have said the problem for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of hierarchies exist on a far </v>

1482
01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>broader spectrum than the political that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these than the narrow,</v>

1483
01:10:19.411 --> 01:10:20.244
<v Speaker 1>like when you were saying like on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole left wing Democrat or Republican </v>

1484
01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:24.084
<v Speaker 1>government or left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing governments have produced a </v>

1485
01:10:25.891 --> 01:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>similar amount of amount of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's sad.</v>

1486
01:10:28.651 --> 01:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not happy about this.</v>

1487
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad thing.</v>

1488
01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:32.123
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it suggest also Jordan that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of solution that were being </v>

1489
01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:36.900
<v Speaker 1>offered is too limited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1490
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.990
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1491
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it suggests that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it indicates that,</v>

1492
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.200
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I think that the problem</v>

1493
01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>of inequality has to be taken with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriousness than it's being taken.</v>

1494
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>And the role of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] obviously you would focus on</v>

1495
01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:52.660
<v Speaker 1>this as a clinical psychologist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>paramount because like,</v>

1496
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.713
<v Speaker 1>cause I kind of believe when I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sort of a sort of a fluctuating </v>

1497
01:10:56.971 --> 01:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>vivid grotesque right wing phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as Donald Trump,</v>

1498
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame people for voting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

1499
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.553
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people feel furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the emotion of anger and </v>

1500
01:11:08.521 --> 01:11:09.354
<v Speaker 1>rage and I suspect that all or all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays out in the Zoetrope of the </v>

1501
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:14.274
<v Speaker 1>material realm is a reflection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity in the psyche activity in </v>

1502
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:18.663
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it be otherwise except for </v>

1503
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:20.544
<v Speaker 1>your course you say it cause in lobsters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nature so that suggest it's even </v>

1504
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>more profound or the that the psyche is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than just human,</v>

1505
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.153
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psyche is all the universal </v>

1506
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:32.124
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose what I suppose what I'm </v>

1507
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>thinking is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my interest is is how can I,</v>

1508
01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.413
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that you've done in </v>

1509
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the last year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1510
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>They are mostly small things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acts of kindness.</v>

1511
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I have a daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a good relationship with her so</v>

1512
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:53.970
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a good thing.</v>

1513
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.833
<v Speaker 1>That's been beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been sort of in fact that is </v>

1514
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:57.114
<v Speaker 1>hugely significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My new found ability to live at one </v>

1515
01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:02.820
<v Speaker 1>might refer to as an ordinary domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1516
01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 1>My willingness to let go of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's perception of maybe things have</v>

1517
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:08.850
<v Speaker 1>all been hugely significant and my sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1518
01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:09.933
<v Speaker 1>I would say my dedication to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self improvement in areas that could </v>

1519
01:12:12.931 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 1>still be regarded as selfish is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1520
01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Still an improvement to sort of take </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise to look after myself.</v>

1521
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:18.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm like drug and alcohol free for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years and at this point that the </v>

1522
01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>epiphany's are beginning to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coalesce.</v>

1523
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:24.263
<v Speaker 1>The things that that I feel I'm perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important is to let go of self </v>

1524
01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>centeredness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

1525
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.153
<v Speaker 1>when I conduct myself in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm not continually thinking what </v>

1526
01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>can I get when I don't look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world as a resource when I don't</v>

1527
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can that person give me?</v>

1528
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 1>What can they give me when I think he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead?</v>

1529
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter on that and 12 it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>

1530
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.820
<v Speaker 1>it says do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient and to do,</v>

1531
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 1>to view the world as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources that can be delivered to you.</v>

1532
01:12:49.351 --> 01:12:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It's in some sense to be expedient is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the short term,</v>

1533
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 1>it's to take the approach of short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>

1534
01:12:56.551 --> 01:12:57.800
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1535
01:12:57.801 --> 01:13:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Self centered is materialistic too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is materialistic but it's also,</v>

1536
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.730
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not optimal and it's,</v>

1537
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.603
<v Speaker 1>it's not wise and the reason for that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it actually turns out like if </v>

1538
01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had a continuing relationship,</v>

1539
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I would want to try to do a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more for you than you do for me.</v>

1540
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.853
<v Speaker 1>I could do that even purely selfishly </v>
<v Speaker 1>say because if I did a little bit more </v>

1541
01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:20.754
<v Speaker 1>for you than you did for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to keep interacting with </v>

1542
01:13:22.771 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1543
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:24.050
<v Speaker 1>How does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1544
01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:26.430
<v Speaker 1>so cause me and you I think get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively easy.</v>

1545
01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>We've found a frequency to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1546
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but say someone like the woman both high</v>
<v Speaker 1>in openness,</v>

1547
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 1>high in openness is a good service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1548
01:13:34.111 --> 01:13:34.944
<v Speaker 1>what about the woman on Channel Four </v>
<v Speaker 1>news who seemed more agitated and stuff </v>

1549
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.623
<v Speaker 1>like do like me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were actually having a </v>

1550
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:43.014
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to have a conversation </v>

1551
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:45.683
<v Speaker 1>that's oriented towards discovering </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you think she has a sort </v>

1552
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:48.924
<v Speaker 1>of a series of linear bar model fruits </v>
<v Speaker 1>affects and she was just dropping them </v>

1553
01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1554
01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happened except once</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was once when you,</v>

1555
01:13:57.421 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be mean to me and she was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit like founded.</v>

1556
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:00.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1557
01:14:00.361 --> 01:14:01.194
<v Speaker 1>Well when I complimented her on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to really be an issue on the </v>

1558
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.880
<v Speaker 1>spot when she said that she was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing to do.</v>

1559
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1560
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1561
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you are an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1562
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this moment,</v>

1563
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>do you not feel like it's a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be,</v>

1564
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you could easily post to me to feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1565
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.173
<v Speaker 1>I just want this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the person that's been in </v>

1566
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the world in that moment.</v>

1567
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital to that person.</v>

1568
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1569
01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:27.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you not feel like in,</v>

1570
01:14:27.481 --> 01:14:32.481
<v Speaker 1>in that moment it w it would be of value</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of service to nurture that person?</v>

1571
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:34.234
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1572
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:35.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a friend of </v>

1573
01:14:36.231 --> 01:14:37.670
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart friend of mine,</v>

1574
01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.430
<v Speaker 2>his name is Wayne Marecki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1575
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.310
<v Speaker 2>he's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's quite the character wing,</v>

1576
01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:44.144
<v Speaker 2>but he w he watched and I've had people </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what I've been doing for the last </v>

1577
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.650
<v Speaker 2>18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people.</v>

1578
01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.110
<v Speaker 2>And they report on what they think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing.</v>

1579
01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:53.960
<v Speaker 2>And so I asked Wayne about the interview</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1580
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:55.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was happy about the fact that I </v>

1581
01:14:56.001 --> 01:14:59.180
<v Speaker 2>conducted myself with a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Carmen detachment and,</v>

1582
01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.700
<v Speaker 2>but he did say something very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1583
01:15:01.701 --> 01:15:03.560
<v Speaker 2>There was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the kind of,</v>

1584
01:15:03.561 --> 01:15:04.394
<v Speaker 2>the culmination of that interview was </v>
<v Speaker 2>where Kathy was challenging me about my </v>

1585
01:15:08.451 --> 01:15:10.550
<v Speaker 2>right to say things that might offend </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

1586
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:11.623
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1587
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:12.591
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

1588
01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:13.424
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've based your whole career and this </v>

1589
01:15:14.601 --> 01:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>interview on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1590
01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and congratulations to you.</v>

1591
01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:22.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what you should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she was taken aback by that and</v>

1592
01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

1593
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.813
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows she was sort of flustered and </v>

1594
01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:28.190
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah you did.</v>

1595
01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.050
<v Speaker 2>And Wayne said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1596
01:15:30.051 --> 01:15:30.884
<v Speaker 2>you could have instead of saying Gotcha </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point you could have taken the </v>

1597
01:15:34.191 --> 01:15:35.024
<v Speaker 2>opportunity there to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to expand on that opening and to try to </v>

1598
01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:44.531
<v Speaker 2>have Jason Conversation very north lane </v>
<v Speaker 2>for not doing that yet Christian thing.</v>

1599
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

1601
01:15:49.851 --> 01:15:51.530
<v Speaker 2>and I thought about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1602
01:15:51.531 --> 01:15:52.364
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there were limitations in the </v>

1603
01:15:54.711 --> 01:15:55.544
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like by that time we were about 25 </v>

1604
01:15:57.741 --> 01:15:59.270
<v Speaker 2>minutes into the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1605
01:15:59.271 --> 01:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>so it was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was coming close to an end.</v>

1606
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:02.383
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes being funny cause I think it </v>

1607
01:16:04.191 --> 01:16:07.100
<v Speaker 2>was reasonably funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was reasonably witty sometimes.</v>

1608
01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:07.934
<v Speaker 2>That's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why comedians are useful </v>

1609
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>because they say funny things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this Justin,</v>

1610
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:14.923
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hopefully they do and hopefully </v>

1611
01:16:16.851 --> 01:16:18.200
<v Speaker 2>they can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1612
01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.253
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's often an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely effective conversational </v>

1613
01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:23.820
<v Speaker 2>maneuver</v>

1614
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.653
<v Speaker 1>because he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of fact you said so who </v>

1615
01:16:25.591 --> 01:16:26.520
<v Speaker 1>aren't coming to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing,</v>

1616
01:16:26.521 --> 01:16:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just frying a few things at you now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know the reason I do this,</v>

1617
01:16:29.581 --> 01:16:31.700
<v Speaker 1>cause I started doing a good degree at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>university of course,</v>

1618
01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:34.230
<v Speaker 1>so as called religion and global </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and one of the main things they</v>

1619
01:16:34.231 --> 01:16:35.064
<v Speaker 1>taught taught me there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of the things I've intrigued me </v>

1620
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:39.270
<v Speaker 1>is the first thing they show you is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of a bull shark.</v>

1621
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.133
<v Speaker 1>There's bear literature by Boucher where</v>
<v Speaker 1>some story can't remember it called the </v>

1622
01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Chinese emperor system of taxonomy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show and the stories of the house.</v>

1623
01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:47.873
<v Speaker 1>I loved that game and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of an part of the courses </v>

1624
01:16:50.671 --> 01:16:54.600
<v Speaker 1>they took about who gets to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>what words like natural or power.</v>

1625
01:16:54.601 --> 01:16:54.991
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1626
01:16:54.991 --> 01:16:57.600
<v Speaker 1>who gets to determine how those terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>are allocated,</v>

1627
01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.440
<v Speaker 1>who gets to determine what's right </v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed</v>

1628
01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.273
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's being rejected to build </v>

1629
01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.753
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] because I wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>let the radical left just decided the </v>

1630
01:17:07.101 --> 01:17:10.660
<v Speaker 2>linguistic playing ground and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to do you see their,</v>

1631
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 2>their rationale was we're on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people.</v>

1632
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.871
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no you're not.</v>

1633
01:17:14.871 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to control the linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory</v>

1634
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>in a sense like this is where this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is a cure.</v>

1635
01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:22.043
<v Speaker 1>The parallels that conversation I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Sam Harris cause we have Sam </v>

1636
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.033
<v Speaker 1>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I found myself saying is why are </v>

1637
01:17:27.171 --> 01:17:28.004
<v Speaker 1>you so worried about this one particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of zealousness or extremism when </v>

1638
01:17:33.861 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>it seems that power is actually situated</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

1639
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:38.091
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1640
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1641
01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:42.500
<v Speaker 1>in that instance I suppose because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the incidence that came your way.</v>

1642
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1643
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you as you told me at the radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1644
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:47.940
<v Speaker 1>imposition of certain rules around </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that you have.</v>

1645
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>That was the reason for me plus the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that be split.</v>

1646
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>But you have also continued to Farro or </v>
<v Speaker 1>plow that far over.</v>

1647
01:17:53.601 --> 01:17:54.434
<v Speaker 1>Haven't you have considered tenue down </v>
<v Speaker 1>or sort of a line that seems like Telia </v>

1648
01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 1>logically sensible with what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

1649
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Like is it continues to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like in a,</v>

1650
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

1651
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I agreed with your analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word proverb provocateur.</v>

1652
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:07.820
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a person is provoked if</v>

1653
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they're not provoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a provocateur.</v>

1654
01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:12.320
<v Speaker 1>So we say difficult labeled to apply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

1655
01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.560
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that you know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1656
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 1>when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1657
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>young males are particularly sort of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to your work,</v>

1658
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I do see that this is a time where males</v>
<v Speaker 1>need guidance and like where there isn't</v>

1659
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Speaker 1>the kind of elders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our elders,</v>

1660
01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 1>customs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiations,</v>

1661
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.570
<v Speaker 1>routes to masculinity are in short </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>

1662
01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I can see that there's a real value in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1663
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but I also feel that in this time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social contention,</v>

1664
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.173
<v Speaker 1>I then EU politics being part of it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and conflict that will ideas that </v>

1665
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:49.574
<v Speaker 1>promote unity and the emulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If those kinds of boundaries I feel to </v>

1666
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.830
<v Speaker 1>me it would be particularly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially valuable.</v>

1667
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.083
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1668
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.950
<v Speaker 2>the right way to do that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the individual.</v>

1669
01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me answer that two ways.</v>

1670
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:06.363
<v Speaker 2>The first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first issue is that it isn't self </v>

1671
01:19:09.251 --> 01:19:10.084
<v Speaker 2>evident that the reason that my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've been talking about has been </v>

1672
01:19:14.561 --> 01:19:17.230
<v Speaker 2>attractive to young men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be uh,</v>

1673
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.333
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fluke and it might be a fluke </v>

1674
01:19:20.561 --> 01:19:23.320
<v Speaker 2>because almost everybody who watches </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is male.</v>

1675
01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I look at my youtube </v>

1676
01:19:26.171 --> 01:19:27.670
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 80% male,</v>

1677
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's true of youtube audiences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

1678
01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a typical youtube audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1679
01:19:32.491 --> 01:19:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And so what's his that you intuition </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1680
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.910
<v Speaker 1>cause I complicated</v>

1681
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.833
<v Speaker 2>did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do know that since my book has </v>

1682
01:19:40.421 --> 01:19:42.750
<v Speaker 2>come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching the,</v>

1683
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.930
<v Speaker 2>the demographics of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my public audience that more and more</v>

1684
01:19:46.931 --> 01:19:50.200
<v Speaker 2>and more women are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's now to about 65,</v>

1685
01:19:50.201 --> 01:19:51.610
<v Speaker 2>35 from 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1686
01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:53.860
<v Speaker 2>and more and more older people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out too.</v>

1687
01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:54.933
<v Speaker 2>So I think a fair bit of it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the fact that most of my </v>

1688
01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:01.540
<v Speaker 2>exposure and was to the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1689
01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:02.374
<v Speaker 2>which happens to be mostly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I do also think that there a </v>

1690
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.600
<v Speaker 2>particular crisis with regards to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be described as proper pathways to</v>

1691
01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that's at play.</v>

1692
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's two factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>

1693
01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Kathy Newman kind of went </v>
<v Speaker 2>after me about this,</v>

1694
01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:21.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

1695
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:21.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1696
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>if you're directing your message towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men,</v>

1697
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>which I wasn't assuming that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that divisive?</v>

1698
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1699
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is divisive because </v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1700
01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:35.070
<v Speaker 2>the masculine in women also needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed.</v>

1701
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.420
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

1702
01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:37.523
<v Speaker 2>And the people who are the enemies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the masculine in men are also the </v>

1703
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:44.280
<v Speaker 2>enemies of the masculine and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you overprotect your sons,</v>

1704
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 2>let's say you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to,</v>

1705
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1706
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.370
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you overprotect them in part and,</v>

1707
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.233
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and weaken them because you were afraid </v>

1708
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:53.244
<v Speaker 2>of their masculine energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do exactly the same </v>

1709
01:20:54.511 --> 01:20:56.030
<v Speaker 2>thing to your daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1710
01:20:56.031 --> 01:20:56.864
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1711
01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.900
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the evil is that female,</v>

1712
01:20:58.901 --> 01:21:01.680
<v Speaker 1>a female child would similarly be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disempowered?</v>

1713
01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1714
01:21:02.381 --> 01:21:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

1715
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.990
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing.</v>

1716
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I am a psychometrician that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically my,</v>

1717
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:09.383
<v Speaker 2>my job and we study may our measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and like it's a truism of </v>

1718
01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 2>psychometrics that men and women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more the same than they are different.</v>

1719
01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:20.723
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because I've been sort of </v>

1720
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.310
<v Speaker 2>positioned as someone who is constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>on about the differences between men and</v>

1721
01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:28.740
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men and women are more the same than</v>

1722
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:29.574
<v Speaker 2>they are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that the </v>

1723
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.514
<v Speaker 2>development of masculinity and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps it's not as important as the </v>

1724
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:38.820
<v Speaker 2>development of masculinity in men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's damn important.</v>

1725
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.713
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a close second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if people are pushing down </v>

1726
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.290
<v Speaker 2>masculinity as a virtuous motive being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

1727
01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:49.550
<v Speaker 2>it has a detrimental effect on both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next Buddy.</v>

1728
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I agree with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1729
01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:51.853
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would say did the determinately </v>

1730
01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:54.104
<v Speaker 1>there and biologically that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that his masculinity and that </v>

1731
01:21:57.421 --> 01:21:58.254
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity is present in both females </v>

1732
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1733
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.061
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1734
01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1735
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.193
<v Speaker 1>one of the challenges that this argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the appears to be built around is a </v>

1736
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of hierarchy around those traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Masculinity being synonymous.</v>

1737
01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.270
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with power.</v>

1738
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:15.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

1739
01:22:15.901 --> 01:22:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to bloody ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

1740
01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:18.844
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it on a youtube video on my own </v>

1741
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 1>the other day and a four seat wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stand up to scrutiny.</v>

1742
01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.270
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it a bit,</v>

1743
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 1>check this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit like in Sweden,</v>

1744
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:29.640
<v Speaker 1>they're banning sexually provocative </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising and now it's a kind of thing</v>

1745
01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you hear a lot about like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectification of women.</v>

1746
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.710
<v Speaker 1>And I said to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I support that because there's</v>

1747
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.553
<v Speaker 1>a male being subjected to lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexualized images of women has to a </v>

1748
01:22:38.101 --> 01:22:39.820
<v Speaker 1>degree affected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1749
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when I was younger,</v>

1750
01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.233
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logical conclusion to that is </v>

1751
01:22:44.011 --> 01:22:45.000
<v Speaker 1>pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1752
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:45.923
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really seem to be a good </v>

1753
01:22:46.981 --> 01:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be a good thing.</v>

1754
01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:49.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at pornography any more </v>

1755
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.260
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pornography I think is,</v>

1756
01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very corrupting,</v>

1757
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:54.144
<v Speaker 1>corrosive influence for me personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something I going to be </v>

1758
01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:58.910
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit this check base.</v>

1759
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I goes,</v>

1760
01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:00.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel the use of the female in </v>

1761
01:23:03.841 --> 01:23:04.674
<v Speaker 1>advertising a in general is the ease of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perverted desire to worship the </v>

1762
01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:13.684
<v Speaker 1>feminine then negate it and neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feminine has found it's expression </v>

1763
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:19.023
<v Speaker 1>through consumerism and commerce because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not being properly honored </v>

1764
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:26.220
<v Speaker 1>socially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your heart?</v>

1765
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to think that.</v>

1766
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to think about that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1767
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I would have to think about that a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because ideally it's,</v>

1768
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea worth we're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile,</v>

1769
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.420
<v Speaker 1>like if there are essential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a central yearnings,</v>

1770
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:42.450
<v Speaker 1>if we have like in like eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

1771
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:43.323
<v Speaker 1>if the in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if in indigenous cultures we would have </v>

1772
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:52.771
<v Speaker 1>diabetes to represent gender or certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>energies that are subtler than gender.</v>

1773
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:54.663
<v Speaker 1>If there is a sense that socially those </v>
<v Speaker 1>energies are not being expressed on it </v>

1774
01:23:57.551 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 1>as you've implied with a male pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely the case.</v>

1775
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:02.104
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've often </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about etiologies is that </v>

1776
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:05.203
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like parasites on religious </v>

1777
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're thinking that the,</v>

1778
01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:13.660
<v Speaker 1>the movement of feminine imagery up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consumerist world is an analog or is</v>

1779
01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.253
<v Speaker 1>at least in partial partial part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of not having a symbolic </v>

1780
01:24:19.091 --> 01:24:21.550
<v Speaker 1>place where that attraction can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed.</v>

1781
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1782
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like in the United States is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first family tends to be turned into</v>

1783
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>king and Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:24:28.071 --> 01:24:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no place for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic projection.</v>

1785
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The template requires it.</v>

1786
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I heard once an analysis of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>

1787
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:35.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the revolution that it mimicked </v>

1788
01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.073
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy tyranny that proceeded it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in a different format and as </v>

1789
01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:44.380
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1790
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.020
<v Speaker 1>That so certain energies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Trinity even,</v>

1791
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:47.854
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1792
01:24:47.970 --> 01:24:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Mao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marx,</v>

1793
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Lenin and Stalin depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trinity.</v>

1794
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.793
<v Speaker 1>And some would argue that we know sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the Christianity couldn't take </v>

1795
01:24:56.711 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Speaker 1>hold in Latin America until they </v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced the Pantheism of the saints and</v>

1796
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 1>found and the figure of a virgin until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

1797
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:04.144
<v Speaker 1>they know that in certain cultures the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the virgin had to be elevated because </v>

1798
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a place in the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

1799
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Holy Ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the divine feminine.</v>

1800
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:13.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a union idea.</v>

1801
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1802
01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely that,</v>

1803
01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:17.770
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an original idea of yoga.</v>

1804
01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 1>This is that cool that the trinity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing a core tile and sometimes that's</v>

1805
01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 1>core tile is filled by the finger of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>

1806
01:25:24.101 --> 01:25:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's filled by the finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the woman.</v>

1807
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the houses in Harry Potter,</v>

1808
01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.693
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's three good houses and slitherin </v>

1809
01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1810
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:34.150
<v Speaker 1>there's in the bottom quadrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1811
01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a reflection of the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela structure.</v>

1812
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:38.290
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>

1813
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:39.963
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a place at the table for the </v>

1814
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.094
<v Speaker 1>serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a place that was in </v>

1815
01:25:44.571 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1816
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.400
<v Speaker 1>In the Disney movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't let in that they don't crone.</v>

1817
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.313
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't invite her to the </v>

1818
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:51.154
<v Speaker 1>Christening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their daughter ends up </v>

1819
01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1820
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:55.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't let the terrible mother come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the party.</v>

1821
01:25:55.841 --> 01:25:58.450
<v Speaker 1>So how odder ends up unconsciously now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Domestic normal,</v>

1822
01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.750
<v Speaker 1>everyday quotidian lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the parable mother?</v>

1823
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.480
<v Speaker 1>How does that help section </v>
<v Speaker 1>overprotection</v>

1824
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.960
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever protect the baby.</v>

1825
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Late fall over a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1826
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:10.700
<v Speaker 2>You do do the least amount possible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your children.</v>

1827
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not neglect.</v>

1828
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the old age home adage,</v>

1829
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1830
01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this lots of times with </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

1831
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:21.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe you have to get your kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed up to go out.</v>

1832
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time.</v>

1833
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:24.650
<v Speaker 2>If you let your kid do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1834
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:25.484
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot faster just to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot faster not to have them set </v>

1835
01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot faster to do things for them.</v>

1836
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Plus there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>

1837
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:35.420
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of the devouring mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype,</v>

1838
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:38.420
<v Speaker 2>is like if you've devoted your life to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

1839
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.510
<v Speaker 2>perhaps more than you should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1840
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 2>then it's very difficult to let the </v>
<v Speaker 2>child go.</v>

1841
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:44.780
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1842
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.613
<v Speaker 2>What's there left for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this terrible temptation </v>

1843
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:51.410
<v Speaker 2>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll all do everything for you,</v>

1844
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:54.710
<v Speaker 2>but you never leave me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for the child to say,</v>

1845
01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.431
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1846
01:26:55.431 --> 01:26:57.230
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the right face to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

1847
01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:58.064
<v Speaker 2>That's a very terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that again in Disney </v>

1848
01:26:59.821 --> 01:27:00.654
<v Speaker 2>sleeping beauty where maleficent has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroic prints in the dungeon and it's </v>

1849
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.120
<v Speaker 2>laughing at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1850
01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 2>She's not gonna let them go until he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient.</v>

1851
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a consequence.</v>

1852
01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.323
<v Speaker 2>Can we see the devouring level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have some good pop cultural </v>

1853
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:14.680
<v Speaker 2>examples of the Disney movies all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1854
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1855
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.930
<v Speaker 2>in the little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Little Mermaid,</v>

1856
01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:18.973
<v Speaker 2>Ursula devouring mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devouring mother shows up all the </v>

1857
01:27:21.771 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the witch.</v>

1858
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.700
<v Speaker 2>She's the swamp dweller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the,</v>

1859
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 2>she's the evil queen in Snow White was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the counterpoint.</v>

1860
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:30.540
<v Speaker 2>The fairy godmother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fairy God mother.</v>

1861
01:27:30.541 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Just one.</v>

1862
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the positive feminine.</v>

1863
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened,</v>

1864
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 2>that that archetype manifests itself all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place as well.</v>

1865
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.581
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1866
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 2>the fairy godmother's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1868
01:27:40.011 --> 01:27:40.844
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1869
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:42.320
<v Speaker 2>in sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three of them.</v>

1870
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Three little fairies that take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the princess and the forest.</v>

1871
01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:47.270
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The archetype of the positive feminine,</v>

1872
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you always see,</v>

1873
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.833
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that distinguishes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious viewpoint from an ideological </v>

1874
01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:58.901
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint is that there's always a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of nature or the unknown.</v>

1875
01:27:59.060 --> 01:27:59.893
<v Speaker 2>Always you need one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that's highly guys think </v>

1876
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is the online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in Christianity,</v>

1877
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to think about that for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

1878
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the virgin mother.</v>

1879
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly a positive representation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

1880
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.393
<v Speaker 2>so and that that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the benevolence of </v>

1881
01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.110
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1882
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's the unknown.</v>

1883
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.713
<v Speaker 2>But in a religious representation you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the positive and the positive and </v>

1884
01:28:28.481 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspect of the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also the unknown.</v>

1885
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 2>You have the positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the,</v>

1886
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.120
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the state.</v>

1887
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the wise king and the d and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>devouring king,</v>

1888
01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 2>and you have the positive and negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the individual and the</v>

1889
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 2>reason it's religious in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to explain why in a very short</v>

1890
01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:46.784
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a religious viewpoint always gives </v>

1891
01:28:48.711 --> 01:28:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you a balanced viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it religious.</v>

1892
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a positive element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intensely positive,</v>

1893
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 2>but there's the negative counterpart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a positive.</v>

1894
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you an example here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1895
01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I can give you an example of how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>plays out.</v>

1896
01:29:04.681 --> 01:29:05.514
<v Speaker 2>Architecturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The frontier myth that settled the west </v>

1897
01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.800
<v Speaker 2>was essentially heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual positive,</v>

1898
01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.490
<v Speaker 2>bringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1899
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.553
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of ordering culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive to the desolate barren </v>

1900
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.380
<v Speaker 2>wastelands of the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1901
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 2>So it's positive individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive culture,</v>

1902
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>negative nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1903
01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.473
<v Speaker 2>So that's an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a powerful story cause it's </v>

1904
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 2>true heroic individual bearer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

1905
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:31.740
<v Speaker 2>barren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desolate wasteland.</v>

1906
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.633
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that eventually </v>

1907
01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:35.904
<v Speaker 2>generated was a counter narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that because it was only half the </v>

1908
01:29:38.011 --> 01:29:38.844
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that counter narrative was the </v>

1909
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:40.254
<v Speaker 2>environmental narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was rapacious individual bringing </v>

1910
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:47.060
<v Speaker 2>pillaging society into benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1911
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.083
<v Speaker 1>And they had to recast the indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that lived on those land masses </v>

1912
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:51.744
<v Speaker 1>is savage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not entitled to the same rights roic </v>

1913
01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.533
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>

1914
01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.020
<v Speaker 2>There were actually two competing </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendencies in,</v>

1915
01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:01.690
<v Speaker 2>in the western mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was the noble savage.</v>

1916
01:30:01.691 --> 01:30:03.520
<v Speaker 2>So that was the first son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1917
01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:06.920
<v Speaker 2>And the other was denison barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan is enough.</v>

1918
01:30:06.921 --> 01:30:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1919
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:09.020
<v Speaker 1>the uninhabited waistline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are both arms.</v>

1920
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:11.023
<v Speaker 1>The romantic idea of the noble savage </v>
<v Speaker 1>became some sort of whimsical new age </v>

1921
01:30:14.061 --> 01:30:14.894
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a one and the other one </v>

1922
01:30:15.811 --> 01:30:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that Dennis in barbarian became </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification.</v>

1923
01:30:18.981 --> 01:30:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Vagina side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1924
01:30:20.601 --> 01:30:21.434
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look to wrap up because I can feel </v>

1925
01:30:21.981 --> 01:30:23.440

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1926

<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
