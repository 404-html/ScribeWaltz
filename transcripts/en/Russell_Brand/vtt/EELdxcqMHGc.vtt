WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And if we can somehow extract what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive from a,</v>

2
00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:07.760
<v Speaker 1>what is called religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it might,</v>

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>it leads us to ideas such as fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unity,</v>

4
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.463
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.373
<v Speaker 1>we do you not find a and connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>between what you have learned in </v>

7
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience and what you have learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from studying sort of Buddhism?</v>

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The connections are very direct,</v>

9
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.164
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>how they know that stuff,</v>

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 2>but we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want just because it's,</v>

12
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just the nature of consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about people who spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the Buddhist case,</v>

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.413
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just an incredible amount of time </v>

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 2>studying from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 2>from the first person side what </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

17
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 2>like what his character is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The central claim of Buddhism is not </v>

18
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>just Buddhism but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Buddhism.</v>

19
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 2>And I would put several of the Indian </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions like Advaita Vedanta in there</v>

20
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 2>with the central claims that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self is an illusion.</v>

21
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 2>The EGO is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where.</v>

22
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 2>And when I say self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that people are illusions.</v>

23
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.334
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the sense that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject riding around in your head </v>

24
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.023
<v Speaker 2>thinking your thoughts rather than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thinker in addition to the </v>

25
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:14.994
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an illusion and that makes </v>

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 2>perfect sense neurologically because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

27
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 2>There's no place in the brain for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ego to be sitting.</v>

28
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no central place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything comes together.</v>

29
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 2>There's no unchanging center in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

30
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.783
<v Speaker 2>You're just talking about a cascade of </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiology and everything is </v>

31
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 2>distributed everywhere and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are various parts of the brain</v>

32
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 2>that are coming online and off and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and subserving conscious dates and not.</v>

33
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a process and there is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could experience consciousness as</v>

35
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 2>a flow of sensory and emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interoceptive experience without a.</v>

36
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 2>The sense that there's an unchanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>center riding around on that flow,</v>

37
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a man in a boat on the,</v>

38
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:07.134
<v Speaker 2>on the stream of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could experience that </v>

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 2>consciousness without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be an experience that is much</v>

40
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 2>more coincidence with what we understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurologically.</v>

41
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.593
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be to experience something </v>

42
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 2>that is more true from the third person </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain based,</v>

43
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.603
<v Speaker 2>what do we see inside the head side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just so happens you can't </v>

44
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 2>experience that.</v>

45
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.013
<v Speaker 2>That is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is how that is what meditation is </v>

46
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>like when you really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditate.</v>

47
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.543
<v Speaker 2>This sense that there's a meditator in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head strategically paying attention </v>

48
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 2>to experience rather than just pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that drops away.</v>

49
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's this one.</v>

50
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.374
<v Speaker 2>That's one piece of data in favor of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the of introspection here and it's </v>

51
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.444
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a piece that the western </v>

52
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>intellectual tradition or the West or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the western spiritual tradition ever got</v>

53
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 2>a good hand handle on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.893
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find specific Christian and </v>

55
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Jewish and Muslim mistakes making these </v>
<v Speaker 2>noises,</v>

56
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.703
<v Speaker 2>but they make the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they make these noises </v>

57
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.354
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to sound like Buddhists and </v>

58
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>they're co-religionists want to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>them rather often.</v>

59
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Religionists powerful within nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>states in economic life,</v>

60
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>people stopped believing they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

61
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very out to market at them.</v>
