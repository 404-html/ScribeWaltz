1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I not think this individualistic culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in itself.</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Destroying the principles are spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>human level of community.</v>

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.723
<v Speaker 1>Do you not think that economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality creates in a human being a </v>

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>sense of injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of unfairness?</v>

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.393
<v Speaker 1>Because people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what Kandis the 90 percent </v>

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>of people that are rich?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why they're rich?</v>

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>They was born rich because I to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

8
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that economic disparity creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling,</v>

9
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.504
<v Speaker 1>but at a fundamental understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics can tell you that most people </v>

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>that are rich are born rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's a tiny minority of</v>

11
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.584
<v Speaker 1>people that are like you that come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor background and managed to </v>

12
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>overcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what a pro I problem.</v>

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed we have a lot of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is they sort of belief that their</v>

14
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>greatness is something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>replicated and I don't think it it can.</v>

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.483
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe in the individual you </v>

16
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for differences,</v>

17
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but the primary goal of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be to serve the community.</v>

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.643
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that the primary goal </v>

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>of what the individual fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're discounting the human spirit.</v>

21
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>He was counting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there is.</v>

22
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a quick no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not in a humanity.</v>

23
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Think of animals in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even have to go to humanity.</v>

24
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>We can just think about animals in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

25
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>What is our human instinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

26
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to make sure that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this block is fed?</v>

27
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Before you feed yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you go around and say,</v>

28
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.283
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you had breakfast this morning at </v>

29

<v Speaker 1>eating?</v>

31
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>If you have any of you have an excess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you're going to do the humans.</v>

32
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Human condition in our incentives are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be one of the richest.</v>

33
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>The 15 people on the planet have got as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much cumulative.</v>

34
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Well first,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They are the ones that are pushing it.</v>

47
