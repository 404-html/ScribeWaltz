1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>What point is the distinction occurring </v>
<v Speaker 1>between sort of a living,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>vibrant earth which we participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychically,</v>

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>spiritually and totally and the earth as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a resource and I wondered if that day,</v>

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that occurs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition from Pantheism,</v>

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.723
<v Speaker 1>paganism to monotheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were the sort of sacred endowment </v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes these things are,</v>

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental.</v>

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's so significant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it's both a cause of this shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a symptom of the shift,</v>

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but the more distance we are from </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

12
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.264
<v Speaker 2>the more it seems that God is not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature but is kind of the external </v>

13
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.841
<v Speaker 2>overseer of nature and and actual beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>of nature lose their being ness.</v>

14
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the things that we blame as </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars are actually symptom.</v>

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 2>How do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing it a lot in,</v>

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 2>in climate change and environmental ism </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.673
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's okay to keep referring back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that because my mind is kind of in </v>

19
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 2>that space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most alarming things </v>

21
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 2>happening is what I'm calling the insect</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust.</v>

22
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.753
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed that there's less bugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>splatter on the window then when you </v>

23
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 2>were a kid?</v>

24
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That less a good covering of Split </v>

25
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Telecon Nice of a Steven Spielberg Sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>splatter.</v>

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not your imagination like there's </v>

27
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>been approximately a 75 percent loss of </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying insect biomass over 30 years.</v>

28
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 2>So confronted with anything like that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>forest fires or hurricanes.</v>

29
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 2>This mindset of fundamentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of money,</v>

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 2>of war has a jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Have some water from this little baker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 2>It has us jump to the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the cause?</v>

33
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insect die off.</v>

34
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 2>It must be climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forest fires.</v>

35
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 2>It must be climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.233
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find an enemy is one of the deep </v>

37
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 2>programs of our culture to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

38
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my son who's five,</v>

39
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.683
<v Speaker 2>got this book from the library about </v>
<v Speaker 2>superheroes and it has all these little </v>

40
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>anecdotes about the avengers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

41
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and each story in there,</v>

42
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the template was the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad thing is happening,</v>

43
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.623
<v Speaker 2>the cause is a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the solution is to defeat the bad </v>

44
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>guy by force.</v>

45
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.183
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an example of a reductionism </v>

46
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 2>that also has us reduced the living </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity of earth to a single cause,</v>

47
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.873
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm wary of putting all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environmental eggs into the basket </v>

48
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>of climate change and seeing if we only </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve this one thing,</v>

49
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 2>then everything else will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what do we not see in that?</v>

50
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:55.584
<v Speaker 2>Reductionism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reductionism always leaves things out </v>

51
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>and in this case it leaves out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeated dousing of the entire landscape</v>

52
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>with pesticides over the last 90 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leaves out habitat destruction,</v>

53
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 2>it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it leaves out deforestation.</v>

54
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.213
<v Speaker 2>Which one thing that came out of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my research for this book is that that </v>

55
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 2>deforestation and land abuse is a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger cause of the flood drought cycle.</v>

56
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Forest fires and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then greenhouse gases.</v>

57
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

58
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.853
<v Speaker 1>advantage does the climate change </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative give the powerful that is not </v>

59
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.874
<v Speaker 1>in their deforestation habitat </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction narrative in order for the </v>

60
00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>climate change narrative to be favored,</v>

61
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.363
<v Speaker 2>it lends itself to quantitative </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions that you can make money off </v>

62
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:38.334
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

63
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's always bad quantatative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you explain what you mean?</v>

64
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:43.634
<v Speaker 2>if it becomes a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of say increase increasing carbon </v>

66
00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:47.384
<v Speaker 2>sequestration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can plant biofuels plantations </v>

67
00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 2>across Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia and South America,</v>

68
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>which is happening that the numbers look</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

69
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.713
<v Speaker 2>The metrics look good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening on the ground is </v>

70
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 2>subsistence peasants are being forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of their traditional lifestyles.</v>

71
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pristine ecosystems are being leveled to</v>

72
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:06.164
<v Speaker 2>plant fast growing trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A communal land holdings are being </v>

73
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 2>converted into titled The property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

74
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.850
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people are getting evicted </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their land,</v>

75
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.110
<v Speaker 2>like when things get monetized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced to a number,</v>

76
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.910
<v Speaker 2>the things that you cannot reduce to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number get left out.</v>

77
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

78
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we quantify things,</v>

79
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.143
<v Speaker 2>they fit into a society that is built on</v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement and quantification and </v>

80
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the conversion of all things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the number called value.</v>

81
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

82
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I could go on and on.</v>

83
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.623
<v Speaker 1>I met our goal and he was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine about </v>

84
00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>environmentalism and climate change </v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was meeting him,</v>

85
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.953
<v Speaker 1>I felt this feeling of deep frustration </v>
<v Speaker 1>at not that alcohol might not be a nice </v>

86
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:03.264
<v Speaker 1>guy because it's sort of documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him once and I saw he's capping </v>

87
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.513
<v Speaker 1>and it did seem like a nice guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>captain with pictures of his dad up and </v>

88
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human and uh,</v>

89
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.563
<v Speaker 1>but what I felt was that everything he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying was invisibly caveated with </v>

90
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:18.114
<v Speaker 1>the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it affects the interests of the </v>

91
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:22.224
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must do something about carbon </v>

92
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>emissions unless it affects the interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the powerful.</v>

93
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.083
<v Speaker 1>Then we went day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must decide unless you energy </v>

94
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:30.024
<v Speaker 1>concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it affects the interest of the </v>

95
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing that I instinctively felt.</v>

96
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.523
<v Speaker 1>It feels like it maybe relates to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said and maybe have even more </v>

97
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 1>information on that.</v>

98
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel a little suspicious of the </v>

99
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.793
<v Speaker 2>dominant climate change narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the powerful are so willing to </v>

100
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:51.084
<v Speaker 2>accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a lot less disruptive than </v>

101
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>the alternative narrative that I like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work with,</v>

102
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.641
<v Speaker 2>which is the living earth narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>which says that the earth is alive,</v>

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.623
<v Speaker 2>that it's health depends on the health </v>
<v Speaker 2>of its organs and tissues and what are </v>

104
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the forests,</v>

105
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 2>the wetlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seagrass meadows,</v>

106
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>the mangroves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elephants,</v>

107
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>the whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fish,</v>

108
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.843
<v Speaker 2>the corals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that is destroyed by </v>

109
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.424
<v Speaker 2>development is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are in the carbon mind fret </v>

110
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.683
<v Speaker 2>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then even if you value a forest for its </v>

111
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.601
<v Speaker 2>carbon storage and sequestration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you've reduced it to that number,</v>

112
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.133
<v Speaker 2>you could cut it down if there's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold to mine underneath it or oil and </v>

113
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:49.181
<v Speaker 2>plant another for somewhere else to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>up for it because it's just the numbers.</v>

114
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could cut it down,</v>

115
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but install lots of solar panels to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offset that.</v>

116
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.303
<v Speaker 2>That carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not treating Earth as alive and </v>

117
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 2>and precious and sacred by operating in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that quantitative mindset,</v>
