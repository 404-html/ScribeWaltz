00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>My guest on under the skin today is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor Robin Carhart Harris,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>the head of psychedelic research at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Imperial College London,</v>

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.703
<v Speaker 1>and he's not even 37 years of age yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already been described as the whiz </v>

4
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.914
<v Speaker 1>kid of psychedelic research and imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>how competitive that field is and the </v>

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger brother of Brian Cox,</v>

6
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:23.844
<v Speaker 1>who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll hopefully have only the </v>

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>university did a lovely thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>His research is as exciting as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>taboo.</v>

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.643
<v Speaker 1>He investigates the brain effects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential therapeutic uses of </v>

10
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.554
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs and as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the first person in the UK to have </v>

11
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.884
<v Speaker 1>legally administered doses of Lsd to </v>
<v Speaker 1>human volunteers since the misuse of </v>

12
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>drug act in 1971.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for coming on the show.</v>

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Nice to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for inviting me.</v>

16
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so kind to say,</v>

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>can I call you doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

18
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not a medical doctor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to banks.</v>

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.133
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that's not a medical doctor I </v>

20
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:01.914
<v Speaker 1>think should be stripped of that title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're wearing a white coat and </v>

21
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>putting your fingers up people's bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider you part of our system.</v>

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin.</v>

23
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm still have a sufficiently did wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find titles at lowering doctors,</v>

24
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>

25
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying into it and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you tell me what that means that you</v>

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>are the head of psychedelic research it</v>

27
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 2>the empirical what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on for the last few years?</v>

28
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I suppose about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.013
<v Speaker 2>eight years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing human research with </v>

30
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.683
<v Speaker 2>I've done a number of brain imaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies looking at how these drugs work </v>

32
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 2>most recently I've transitioned into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>giving a psychedelic for a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric disorder to try and treat it</v>

35
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 2>as depression and we give psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is found in magic mushrooms.</v>

36
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.653
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now the team is transitioning more </v>

37
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 2>into looking at applications and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>these drugs can be useful,</v>

38
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 2>not just how they work.</v>

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presumably if you're moving to the point</v>

40
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>of application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the efficacy of these substances</v>

41
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>have been established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm ragging.</v>

42
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:15.024
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to learn how someone growing </v>

43
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a British person.</v>

44
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

45
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>how did you get into psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's,</v>

46
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me like a broad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting field.</v>

47
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about your academic</v>

48
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 2>background and how you became interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

49
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's kind of two aspects to the story </v>

50
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps the latter one which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to talk about.</v>

51
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Happened around my early twenties when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was studying psychoanalysis,</v>

52
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.493
<v Speaker 2>so freud and yoga and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was absolutely fascinated by this </v>

53
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 2>topic and I couldn't get enough of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>

54
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any opportunity reading whatever I </v>

55
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:01.731
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also felt little dissatisfied with</v>

56
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>where psychoanalysis sat in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream psychology.</v>

57
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it felt Kinda clickish it felt that's </v>

58
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.793
<v Speaker 2>not scientific enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't seem to have convinced people </v>

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.413
<v Speaker 2>of the validity of its main ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the existence of the unconscious </v>

60
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

61
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.133
<v Speaker 2>And I was a believer in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want it to have to be that </v>

62
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want it to have to be a kind of</v>

63
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>leap of faith.</v>

64
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we could maybe demonstrate </v>

65
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>that certain principles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis a true.</v>

66
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.723
<v Speaker 2>And by these principles you mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily the existence of an </v>

67
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>unconscious on an individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

68
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 2>but also a collective level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be called Young's work,</v>

69
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that there's aspects of our psyches that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are shared ena,</v>

70
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>certain themes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain ways of being certain aspects of</v>

71
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.410
<v Speaker 2>the human condition that are enough or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is demonstrated what through me</v>

72
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.340
<v Speaker 2>motifs and archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you find that so interesting?</v>

74
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because it felt true because it </v>

75
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 2>resonated with me and I think you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see it in culture.</v>

76
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.930
<v Speaker 2>You can see it in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

77
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>

78
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wanted to demonstrate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's real meat here.</v>

80
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 2>fantasy or the product of our or young's</v>
<v Speaker 2>and others,</v>

82
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild imaginations that these things are </v>

83
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:33.924
<v Speaker 2>kind of real.</v>

84
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast,</v>

85
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.704
<v Speaker 2>the reason I do it is to educate myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to educate others and to try to in </v>

86
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 2>some way translate the gap that exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>between academia and what you would call</v>

87
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.433
<v Speaker 2>normal people or everybody else that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have access to this sort of </v>

88
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.504
<v Speaker 2>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nomenclature of academia of which the </v>

89
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>word nomenclature is undoubtedly an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

90
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.363
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like when you talk about Freud and </v>

91
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>young and the psychoanalysis and some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like key ideas.</v>

92
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.953
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this distinction between Freud's </v>

93
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 2>view of the unconscious and young's view</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unconscious,</v>

94
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 2>So Freud put most of the emphasis on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on sex,</v>

96
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexuality and also,</v>

97
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Freudian unconscious if you want,</v>

99
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 2>had much more to do with our own lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our relationships with important figures</v>

100
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>in our lives and particularly our </v>
<v Speaker 2>parental figures.</v>

101
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas young kind of transcended that </v>

102
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:34.654
<v Speaker 2>level and talked about the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind with reference to culture and </v>

103
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:45.841
<v Speaker 2>religion and mysticism and so it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

104
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 2>if you want a sort of deeper aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our minds,</v>

105
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>our unconscious minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want.</v>

106
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 2>The young was particularly interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

107
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.603
<v Speaker 2>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bit of a spat between the </v>

108
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.094
<v Speaker 2>two figures and young felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud put too much on sex and the </v>

109
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:06.911
<v Speaker 2>personal [inaudible] I can pretty funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage or don't get about sex and stop</v>

110
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Speaker 2>thinking Freud and young does it come by</v>
<v Speaker 2>me gasoline?</v>

111
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Freud for everything was coming down </v>

112
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.734
<v Speaker 2>to sex and your individualized life for </v>
<v Speaker 2>young for that there's enough evidence </v>

113
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:26.414
<v Speaker 2>to suggest fruit archetypes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring motifs and themes through </v>

114
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 2>religions culture to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of interconnectivity.</v>

115
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.733
<v Speaker 2>Although in Freud's work on like totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>museum and to bu they're an indication </v>

116
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.684
<v Speaker 2>there that if sort of certain taboos a </v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring for about cultures that that </v>

117
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 2>in itself is an indication of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of collectivized mind.</v>

118
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I think I touched on it and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a slightly,</v>

119
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:50.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversold differentiation that I just </v>

120
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Freud was,</v>

122
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would refer to to kind of collective </v>

123
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>aspects of the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud was more mechanistic,</v>

124
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the young ones as well.</v>

125
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.173
<v Speaker 2>I think the difference is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasize perhaps too much because of </v>

126
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.134
<v Speaker 2>this personal spat between the two and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they kind of emphasize the </v>

127
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they emphasize the differences because I</v>

128
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.184
<v Speaker 2>suppose we take for granted the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we share in common and so the </v>

129
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>differences start to become pertinent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Germane.</v>

130
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 2>So from this early interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness,</v>

131
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she started to think it was all right to</v>

132
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 2>sit around doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justify yourself.</v>

133
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really quite that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more that,</v>

134
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we test this stuff?</v>

135
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

136
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>and I was in a seminar one day and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were the seminar leader and the</v>

137
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.314
<v Speaker 2>people in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about all the different </v>

138
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 2>ways that psychoanalysis had to access </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious mind.</v>

139
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And the best that it could come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much was dreaming,</v>

140
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dreams are brilliant and </v>

141
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.384
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the quite unreliable and minor they </v>

142
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.124
<v Speaker 2>are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are a crap from one page to the </v>

143
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.520
<v Speaker 2>next absolute codswallop becoming out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

144
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.493
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the tools of empirical tools </v>

145
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>for accessing the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our dreams hypnosis,</v>

146
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.733
<v Speaker 2>that sort of like the recognizable tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what a new thing that those tools </v>

147
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>are a bit lame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And you're and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.003
<v Speaker 2>and has been proven really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna convince enough people </v>

151
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.073
<v Speaker 2>with those tools because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have said a dreams that they're </v>

152
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>just chaotic.</v>

153
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>The noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't mean anything.</v>

154
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd actually disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

155
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a popular view that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

156
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.263
<v Speaker 2>a lot of young's work on like say for </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written every day about sort of </v>

157
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.930
<v Speaker 2>compensate every dreams that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

158
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>that the unconscious mind is at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to narrativize your life or we're</v>

159
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>trying to communicate with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've talked already about the idea</v>

160
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 2>of archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems that when we were like,</v>

161
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some senses when we're referring to </v>

162
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 2>the transcendent over referring to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a potent,</v>

163
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 2>an all encompassing being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could in fact be regarded.</v>

164
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.853
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our own unconscious is the repository </v>

165
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>for great information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great knowledge that we have a kind of a</v>

166
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.563
<v Speaker 2>peculiarly unceremonious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent relationship with these </v>

167
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 2>aspects of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're absolutely,</v>

168
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:17.091
<v Speaker 2>and this is where psychedelics come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I stumbled across,</v>

169
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.673
<v Speaker 2>kind of stumbled across some literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>on lsd being used in psychotherapy in </v>

170
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 2>the fifties and sixties.</v>

171
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.003
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just blown away to discover that </v>

172
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:29.574
<v Speaker 2>the main rationale for using LSD and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy was that it would lower </v>

173
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 2>ego defenses and then allow access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

174
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far vaster a realm of our minds,</v>

175
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought this is true.</v>

176
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.403
<v Speaker 2>Had you taken psychedelics by that time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit embarrassed about talking </v>

177
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Embarrassing.</v>

178
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just a sensitive one in I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the stigma,</v>

179
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.433
<v Speaker 2>stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stigma,</v>

180
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.233
<v Speaker 2>stigma of being a scientist studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>these and the mainstream scientific </v>

181
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:03.200
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homicides,</v>

182
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.483
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing drugs and then they think </v>

183
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:07.450
<v Speaker 2>you're a hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a scientist,</v>

184
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

185
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.400
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

186
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 2>But it's in itself a taboo subject and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of,</v>

187
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 2>its origins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

188
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.313
<v Speaker 2>who are the early pioneers around </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics with Timothy leary or like </v>

189
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 2>our oldest Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ram Dass,</v>

190
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.133
<v Speaker 2>that there were a few people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at Mescalin early on in the </v>

191
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.780
<v Speaker 2>early 20th century.</v>

192
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.353
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really a breakthrough happened when </v>

193
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:29.874
<v Speaker 2>the Swiss chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Albert Hofmann a kind of slightly </v>

194
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:33.864
<v Speaker 2>serendipitously came across lsd and </v>
<v Speaker 2>synthesize the lsd while looking for </v>

195
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

196
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more to do with,</v>

197
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.730
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with blood and um,</v>

198
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.011
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

199
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood system,</v>

200
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 2>he synthesized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>

201
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>like go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

202
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.523
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's working away on drive some sort of </v>

203
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 2>circuitry trial and these gotta mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs or what are they related to?</v>

204
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

205
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 2>these fungi that grow on certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasses,</v>

206
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.700
<v Speaker 2>he's working with mushrooms and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

207
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 2>what is it you come to mushroom related </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

208
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

209
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the compounds that we synthesize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of quite a few was Lsd,</v>

210
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

211
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.783
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story goes that he got a bit on his </v>

212
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:16.284
<v Speaker 2>skin and somehow you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ingested it and had this like mild </v>

213
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trip and then I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next day he went back and thought,</v>

214
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.100
<v Speaker 2>well I'll take a tiny little bit just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if,</v>

215
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.380
<v Speaker 2>if it was this lsd 25 that made me feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>so strange.</v>

216
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 2>So we took 200 mics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite,</v>

217
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:34.944
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>250 is quite a big dose of Lsd and he </v>

218
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 2>had a full on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.590
<v Speaker 2>mind blowing a trip full of nightmarish </v>
<v Speaker 2>visions and such like,</v>

220
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh I like that cause it sounds a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit like the hulk.</v>

221
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.633
<v Speaker 2>Then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a little bit on him by accident </v>

222
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and then it becomes sort of basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole course vitamin,</v>

223
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they all follow that template.</v>

224
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Some encounter which is bloody union </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

225
00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And encounter some sort of a mentor </v>

226
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 2>encounter and then it becomes another </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and goes back next day,</v>

227
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:09.331
<v Speaker 2>next 250 or whatever of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes into some form,</v>

228
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.833
<v Speaker 2>some sort of transcendent realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what am so between the twenties in </v>

229
00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 2>the sixties and you don't start here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

230
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.304
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really to what fifties and sixties </v>

231
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 2>started heating up in the fifties.</v>

232
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 2>People started using lsd in really </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic psychotherapy,</v>

233
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:27.940
<v Speaker 2>which kind of dominated psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the kind of Freudian model really,</v>

234
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then into the sixties,</v>

235
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 2>things got a bit more colorful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people started taking it recreationally.</v>

236
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>And then Timothy leary came on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>

237
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 2>He took some magic mushrooms after </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading an article,</v>

238
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these tribes in,</v>

239
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.094
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico who were taking mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he took lsd and everything </v>

240
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 2>changed that he kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an academic originally.</v>

241
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.274
<v Speaker 2>He was at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's some sort of Harvard fuddy duddy </v>

242
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:56.430
<v Speaker 2>with Dickie bow tie and a suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before you know it,</v>

243
00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 2>it's tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dropout,</v>

244
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.743
<v Speaker 2>have a nice relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is very curious that like all </v>

245
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:01.594
<v Speaker 2>these substances or substances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea seems to exist in indigenous </v>

246
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:07.360
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of,</v>

247
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of shamanism or plant based </v>

248
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.233
<v Speaker 2>transcendent experiences is an old idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps in an original idea and </v>

249
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.254
<v Speaker 2>indigenous idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly one of somewhere in the </v>

250
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 2>crucible of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will find this idea where man becomes</v>

251
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 2>religious.</v>

252
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Were man begins to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's as important as that?</v>

253
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the basis of your interesting in</v>

254
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>personally interesting psychedelic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's part of it.</v>

255
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:34.894
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the therapeutic side and there's a lot </v>

256
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:37.700
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

258
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep wisdom to those cultures that use,</v>

259
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 2>that have used psychedelics for maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

260
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a way we're just kind of,</v>

261
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.713
<v Speaker 2>to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're rediscovering what those cultures </v>

262
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 2>always knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we are bringing something new to the</v>

263
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're bringing a,</v>

264
00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

265
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.070
<v Speaker 2>for all our flaws as sort of a western,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

266
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secular people,</v>

267
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

268
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.160
<v Speaker 2>we do have an ability to break things </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

269
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 2>to deconstruct them and to try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the mechanisms underneath.</v>

270
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.653
<v Speaker 2>And that's important is it to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the medicinal and </v>

271
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:24.991
<v Speaker 2>mechanical operation of these chemicals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so I'd say,</v>

272
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to understand how</v>

273
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.570
<v Speaker 2>something works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.080
<v Speaker 2>some people would argue that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes no difference to me to,</v>

275
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.043
<v Speaker 2>to have that knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think sometimes there can be some </v>

276
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

277
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>in where people ascribe the locus of </v>
<v Speaker 2>action of a drug.</v>

278
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.664
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people might say that it's </v>

279
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:52.154
<v Speaker 2>the plant</v>

280
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>that holds an intelligence and we tap in</v>
<v Speaker 1>through taking the plant.</v>

281
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.763
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we surrender to it and allow its </v>

282
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to guide us that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom or the Ios or wherever.</v>

283
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

284
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Or they may say that it's the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.144
<v Speaker 1>these eco rose that sharman seeing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of chance that is sung to people </v>

286
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>while they're under the influence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of say,</v>

287
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I want this jungle psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

288
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.333
<v Speaker 1>whether it's wave or a particle </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere or another is affecting </v>

289
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:21.884
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever is the wave or the vibration </v>

290
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:24.674
<v Speaker 1>form of the chance or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularities of the substance will </v>

291
00:15:28.201 --> 00:15:29.034
<v Speaker 1>one way or another consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being shifted this way versus particle </v>

292
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That what is the essential element?</v>

293
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that there be light?</v>

294
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Let there be matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

295
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>What is it about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

296
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>View Mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you net them bloody drugs.</v>

297
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to know all about it clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like you know me.</v>

298
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm in recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know me.</v>

299
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm in recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take.</v>

300
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I've not had taken any drugs at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a drink one day at a time,</v>

301
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 1>14 and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>

302
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.133
<v Speaker 1>Bill Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder of 12 step fellowships </v>

303
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.373
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became very interested in psychedelics </v>

304
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:00.734
<v Speaker 1>for a brief while after he got clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>from alcohol and I think hunger your </v>

305
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim leary there for awhile and he wanted</v>

306
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>to integrate lsd into the 12 steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be an interesting addition.</v>

307
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Imagine just kind of finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding God,</v>

308
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:16.720
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding really in a sense.</v>

309
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The twelfth step is having had a </v>

310
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>spiritual awakening as the result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these steps.</v>

311
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.604
<v Speaker 1>We made a decision to turn out life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>will over God and to practice these </v>

312
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>principles in all our affairs.</v>

313
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 1>So eventually I suppose a life of </v>
<v Speaker 1>altruism,</v>

314
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>philanthropy and service based on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization now like me,</v>

315
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:33.734
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I work in media and write </v>

316
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>children's books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am prepared to say that like,</v>

317
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:38.774
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken lsd when I was sort of the </v>

318
00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 16 and something very.</v>

319
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems.</v>

320
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I essentially,</v>

321
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>when you say like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was used in therapy to break down the</v>

322
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:50.280
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see what people mean because we're</v>

323
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.140
<v Speaker 1>the most obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most obvious,</v>

324
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 1>most immediate and most tangible thing I</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced was,</v>

325
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not me.</v>

326
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

327
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not what I thought I was this idea </v>

328
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 1>because what I personally felt was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>chained to my identity.</v>

329
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born at this time.</v>

330
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>This is what I believe in.</v>

331
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I support West Ham united.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Morrissey,</v>

332
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.493
<v Speaker 1>and I remember feeling all that stuff's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismantling in a mirror and like the </v>

333
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.263
<v Speaker 1>feeling somewhat afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see why they would need to be </v>

334
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:20.474
<v Speaker 1>caution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several mini mentorship and guidance </v>

335
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>when dealing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose in a secular society,</v>

336
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.973
<v Speaker 1>clinical conditions is what replaces the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of ritual or ceremony for Shaman </v>

337
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.460
<v Speaker 1>guidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of businesses.</v>

338
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.483
<v Speaker 1>We're taking it laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this in a park with Glen </v>

339
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>and dean doing assay and staring at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds of framing up in a calypso.</v>

340
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I slowly made a bloody laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

341
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we take borrow</v>

342
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.620
<v Speaker 2>from what's gone before and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

343
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.473
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the sort of semantic model </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that we do change the </v>

344
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.780
<v Speaker 2>laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>we get rid of the fluorescent lighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's low thank God and we have,</v>

346
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have some nice ambient music in hype,</v>

347
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.730
<v Speaker 2>some bloody Pam Power,</v>

348
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:15.950
<v Speaker 3>what you created</v>

349
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.783
<v Speaker 2>in the laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laboratory conditions for psychedelics </v>

350
00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:21.380
<v Speaker 2>means what taught me through what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process is.</v>

351
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

352
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.700
<v Speaker 2>we'll um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll bring in some,</v>

353
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.470
<v Speaker 2>some low lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

354
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.843
<v Speaker 2>will a compiler playlists that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has a certain structure to chat </v>

355
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:34.884
<v Speaker 2>someone up.</v>

356
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 3>He'd be there tonight.</v>

357
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

358
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna sound worse now,</v>

359
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 2>but we built a certain relationship as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

360
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 2>so of trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lovely.</v>

361
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we try and get to know each other </v>

362
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.690
<v Speaker 2>and kind of lay things on the table and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we changed literally romantic objects or</v>

363
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in it,</v>

364
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 2>an atmosphere of trust and open </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

365
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 2>How many people were at one time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>

366
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just you and one person.</v>

367
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.570
<v Speaker 2>How does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

368
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.513
<v Speaker 2>usually two people we call them guides </v>
<v Speaker 2>or sitters and people are on the level </v>

369
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:19.450
<v Speaker 2>they have not took nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

370
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 2>usually they have that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment.</v>

371
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And I know they're sober that the sober </v>
<v Speaker 2>guides so visitors',</v>

372
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

373
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.890
<v Speaker 2>particularly compassionate and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and encourage a,</v>

375
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

376
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Speaker 2>an atmosphere of openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a willingness to let go,</v>

377
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explore,</v>

378
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to surrender that analytical mind,</v>

379
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.003
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was talking about earlier and to </v>

380
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 2>trust and to kind of go with the flow of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience.</v>

381
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 2>What substances have you been working </v>
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>

382
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Psilocybin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Magic mushrooms.</v>

383
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.440
<v Speaker 2>So solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon's in magic,</v>

384
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lsd a.</v>

385
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Now dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have my colleague next to me,</v>

386
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Christian woman who's studying dmt at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

387
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm an MC as well to help me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand dmt that's based on that show</v>

388
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 2>coming song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite childish.</v>

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 2>A hello a Christian woman or you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced as a phd student.</v>

390
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:19.420
<v Speaker 2>What you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris.</v>

391
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome.</v>

392
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.083
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing your phd in mate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Phd currently leading a study on </v>

393
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:27.564
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out what are the effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the brain and kind of like licking </v>

394
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:32.154
<v Speaker 2>experience and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to work out that what </v>

395
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me what that involves.</v>

396
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris?</v>

397
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're basically giving the empty to </v>

398
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:45.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of healthy participants.</v>

399
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So this young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students at imperial college</v>

400
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.913
<v Speaker 1>primary,</v>

401
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.863
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have a wide range of </v>

402
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.300
<v Speaker 4>interests that people in our studies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have from 20 to 50 years.</v>

403
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Fifty year old people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

404
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And talk me through the process.</v>

405
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.120
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

406
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 4>we have to kind of like main phases of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the study.</v>

407
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 4>So on the first one we wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

408
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:10.864
<v Speaker 4>address,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we give a nice dose of dmt without </v>

409
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 4>inducing anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

410
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 4>it's such a strong drug that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it in the best possible way,</v>

411
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 4>but you want to get the effects that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're after,</v>

412
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.293
<v Speaker 4>you want to get to those far out sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences in the best way and safest </v>

413
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 4>way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we first did a pilot phase,</v>

414
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.440
<v Speaker 4>there was no brain imaging being done </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

415
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.323
<v Speaker 4>just people were just sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the nice environment just chilling and </v>

416
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.240
<v Speaker 4>we gave them different doses of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>empty,</v>

417
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 4>a nice setting.</v>

418
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 4>We saw what happened during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

419
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 4>We kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did interviews,</v>

420
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 4>questionnaires kind of like address that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the most detailed way possible,</v>

421
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 4>trying to map these effects and </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

422
00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with that we characterize it,</v>

423
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 4>will find the right dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now we're moving into actually brain</v>

424
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 4>imaging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like proper,</v>

425
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:06.814
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people did you trial to </v>

426
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.030
<v Speaker 4>establish what you consider to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right dose?</v>

427
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.253
<v Speaker 4>12 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what did you find across these 12 </v>

428
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:14.650
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

429
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 4>we found that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

430
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 4>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we tried out three different doses,</v>

431
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right dose,</v>

432
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.433
<v Speaker 4>the experience characterized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by the right dose for those kind of </v>

433
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:28.470
<v Speaker 4>like these stages that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

434
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.343
<v Speaker 4>we think are very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first one is this kind of like </v>

435
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 4>bodily rush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 4>this feeling that people are actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>expanding outside of their body somehow.</v>

437
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.533
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then this kind of like entering into a </v>

438
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:46.111
<v Speaker 4>geometric sort of space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very kind of like wonderful,</v>

439
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>colorful,</v>

440
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:48.403
<v Speaker 4>moving geometrical patterns and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing through into this kind of like </v>

441
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.480
<v Speaker 4>different sort of space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

442
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.413
<v Speaker 4>this feeling that you're entering some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of round that it's not coming from </v>

443
00:22:57.881 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 4>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually,</v>

444
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:00.004
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're visiting somewhere else and in </v>

445
00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 4>this space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

446
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.113
<v Speaker 4>many people in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>entities presences that engaged with </v>

447
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:08.590
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with them.</v>

448
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Some receive very meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

449
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 4>some received lake cosmic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spiritual stuff.</v>

450
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Other others have like personal insights</v>
<v Speaker 4>on their lives.</v>

451
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.083
<v Speaker 4>They felt that they were being carried </v>
<v Speaker 4>by someone through messages of </v>

452
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 4>importance and stuff like that.</v>

453
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Corolla Murray,</v>

454
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chris Rather Robin in what Chris is </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing in what you said about your </v>

455
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.373
<v Speaker 1>interest being triggered by the work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and Freud and that there is a </v>

456
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:42.511
<v Speaker 1>commonality of experience that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are describing and that one of the early</v>

457
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 1>phases of it is transcendence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you please just tell me a dmt?</v>

458
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.393
<v Speaker 1>What does it stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They methylate tryptamine die methyl </v>

459
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.993
<v Speaker 1>triptolene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.863
<v Speaker 1>From what is this substance derived?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's found in nature and seriousness </v>

461
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>like plant sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find the actual drug.</v>

462
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

463
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:04.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we buy it from a lab that synthesize it </v>

464
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:07.304
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>a experimental procedures itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can find it in nature.</v>

466
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:11.744
<v Speaker 1>You can find it in the body as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human body has the substance in it </v>

467
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 1>suggest anything to you there some </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence on it?</v>

468
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have very,</v>

469
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:23.420
<v Speaker 1>very small amounts so we don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

470
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:24.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it actually plays a role into any of </v>

471
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 1>these naturally occurring spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

472
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if not,</v>

473
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:31.394
<v Speaker 1>or if just maybe some sort of like out </v>
<v Speaker 1>product of the system just happening by </v>

474
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:35.710
<v Speaker 1>accident scene.</v>

475
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.423
<v Speaker 1>And nonessential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what we're interested in is </v>

476
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

477
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 1>The nature of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this that's happening to us?</v>

478
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 1>What is being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it to experience the information</v>

479
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:52.460
<v Speaker 1>conveyed to us through the senses and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see ourselves as the sort of participant</v>

480
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.533
<v Speaker 1>in and all three of our own reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that can significantly </v>

481
00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.863
<v Speaker 1>disrupt the manner in which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand reality has potentially </v>

482
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:08.561
<v Speaker 1>profound implications for us as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species for the way that we civilize,</v>

483
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.453
<v Speaker 1>socialize an organized one can see why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a substance that's been heavily </v>

484
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:15.554
<v Speaker 1>controlled since its inception in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties when people were working with </v>

485
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:19.394
<v Speaker 1>Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a point where it began to be </v>

486
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of quite heavily policed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled a band.</v>

487
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

488
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:25.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>

489
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Speaker 2>in the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.390
<v Speaker 2>a number of states in the US started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it illegal essentially.</v>

491
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

492
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.450
<v Speaker 2>the research was effected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication.</v>

493
00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Really it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it then became not impossible,</v>

494
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.374
<v Speaker 2>but very difficult to do the research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually at one stage it did become </v>

495
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.320
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm a regulatory.</v>

496
00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:52.260
<v Speaker 2>People were coming round and </v>
<v Speaker 2>confiscating psychedelics.</v>

497
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.460
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a very rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about turn in,</v>

498
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rooney Society's perspective on,</v>

499
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:01.334
<v Speaker 2>on psychedelics,</v>

500
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.740
<v Speaker 1>what was happening in America in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late sixties,</v>

501
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe of interest with regard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls on a experimental hallucinogens</v>

502
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 1>in soccer.</v>

503
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.673
<v Speaker 2>That takes mean there was a lot going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally in terms of the counter </v>

504
00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:16.504
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there was some fears that </v>

505
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe lsd was fueling some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

506
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.101
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's quite likely,</v>

507
00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:25.934
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was a sort of a civil rights </v>

508
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War,</v>

509
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.463
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of counterculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of the beats start to become </v>

510
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:33.704
<v Speaker 1>in a sense politicized like these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the eastern mysticism is now like </v>

511
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.623
<v Speaker 1>goes through the conduit of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and poetry and starts to </v>

512
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.124
<v Speaker 1>become a kind of socializing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicized form is whether it's an </v>

513
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:51.291
<v Speaker 1>artistic form and one can in a perhaps a</v>
<v Speaker 1>not intubate but conject that if society</v>

514
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:54.834
<v Speaker 1>is an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people start looking at society </v>

515
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.943
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more consciousness differently or </v>

516
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:01.284
<v Speaker 1>themselves differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that potential for change is suddenly </v>

517
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.213
<v Speaker 1>dramatically enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that's possibly why </v>

518
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 1>these substances were controlled rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than people are worried about,</v>

519
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dental care or whether or not people are</v>

520
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 1>all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

521
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.283
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways you could characterize it </v>

522
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.514
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the youth becoming more conscious and </v>

523
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>less conformist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more questioning.</v>

524
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.623
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they were doing that anyway or </v>

525
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:28.164
<v Speaker 1>whether the psychedelics are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>fueling those changes because of this </v>

526
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:34.530
<v Speaker 1>idea that psychedelics broadened </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

527
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>There's an interest in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of Terence Mckenna,</v>

528
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose like a,</v>

529
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they're one of the great pioneers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

530
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>One would say of sort of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant based studies,</v>

531
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>but also like for you guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>

532
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:45.474
<v Speaker 1>he must be sort of a controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure and one of the things we have </v>

533
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:47.994
<v Speaker 1>this podcast is I become aware that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are sort of sanctioned academics </v>

534
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and then these people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

535
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy type people.</v>

536
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

537
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.053
<v Speaker 1>an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I'm a great admirer of </v>

538
00:27:58.621 --> 00:27:59.454
<v Speaker 1>territory medics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he so lucid and vivid and </v>

539
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 1>brilliant articular imaginary sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>for profit in a sense like that.</v>

540
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I've picked up that there.</v>

541
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 1>He's on the side of the fence of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not British types of stuff.</v>

542
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You know the thing about Terence Mckenna</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he.</v>

543
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.613
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great speaker at with incredibly </v>

544
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 1>interesting ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

545
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:25.221
<v Speaker 1>whether that's true or not is another is</v>
<v Speaker 1>another question and my view is that the</v>

546
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:27.744
<v Speaker 1>jury's out really on a lot of his ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the meaning of truth is and </v>

547
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:33.683
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the Great Comedians have a </v>

548
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 1>20 a couple of decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he sort of.</v>

549
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

550
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.103
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing maybe got this from a or </v>

551
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:44.874
<v Speaker 1>maybe from your field this way you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>are experts for like a shaman is a </v>

552
00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:52.741
<v Speaker 1>misery sort of psychedelic plants are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an agent of evolution in that is it</v>

553
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 1>has an impact on consciousness and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious experience.</v>

554
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm guessing Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

555
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 1>from what you're saying about like these</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments you've done,</v>

556
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 1>that you've had a little go at that dmt </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself now if you don't mind,</v>

557
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.823
<v Speaker 1>can you tell me exactly what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face because I'd like to know all </v>

558
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 1>about it from the process of how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imbibed to what happens to your mind and</v>

559
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 1>if you can describe the experience using</v>
<v Speaker 1>so blunted tool as language.</v>

560
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to do it so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just going through it again from when</v>

561
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:19.314
<v Speaker 1>you get a hit on the pipe and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in your brain and not like from </v>

562
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 1>a screen from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from experiencing it.</v>

563
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it all begins with this intense,</v>

564
00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:34.010
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very intense rushing the body,</v>

565
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.223
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this kind of like it feels like </v>

566
00:29:37.251 --> 00:29:39.590
<v Speaker 4>this very strong flow of energy going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

567
00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people describe how much she piping</v>

568
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and say you're putting it on a foil on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle and go,</v>

569
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people usually do.</v>

570
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>

571
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Because he's in a university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it look a little bit less under the</v>

572
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.780
<v Speaker 1>bridge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

573
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.780
<v Speaker 1>well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can,</v>

574
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.933
<v Speaker 1>but rather not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think the mechanics of it are </v>

575
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 1>worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>

576
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 1>it worries you guys to talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

577
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.241
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

578
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but we give it intravenously so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

579
00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a needle in a needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

580
00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.873
<v Speaker 1>And then so you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you give people a little and if you </v>

582
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:16.384
<v Speaker 1>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you take it intravenously or do you </v>

583
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:22.290
<v Speaker 1>smoke it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I would have to take.</v>

584
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Is there an eagle you're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal stuff or professional stuff?</v>

585
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

586
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 1>If you hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say hypothetically,</v>

587
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you define it?</v>

588
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Smugged would be the easiest.</v>

589
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.953
<v Speaker 1>I'd worry about the old lungs on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably go straight for the </v>

590
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.573
<v Speaker 1>straight for the old main system brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the brain and to the nape of the </v>

591
00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:47.020
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like it.</v>

592
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

593
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do drugs and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.023
<v Speaker 1>like as a person in recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to be very careful </v>

595
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.893
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talk that psychedelics </v>

596
00:30:52.681 --> 00:30:56.400
<v Speaker 1>can influence addictive behaviors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues around dependencies.</v>

597
00:30:56.401 --> 00:30:57.234
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting area when it comes </v>

598
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:00.483
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal belief is the addiction </v>

599
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.910
<v Speaker 1>stems from trying to solve a spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

600
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:06.803
<v Speaker 1>psychological issue for external mean to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that sexual behavior or average </v>

601
00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:11.094
<v Speaker 1>extreme behaviors around food or </v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling or but most notably and </v>

602
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:17.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously dependency and reliance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and drugs.</v>

603
00:31:17.821 --> 00:31:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't see how someone could become</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on this experience where first</v>

604
00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:22.500
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel a tremendous rush on the body.</v>

605
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Then you have some experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry suggesting that geometry is one</v>

606
00:31:26.461 --> 00:31:27.294
<v Speaker 1>of the archetypal things that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't Greeks were on to something </v>

607
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:34.050
<v Speaker 1>that geometry is actual ways of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shapes and performing and then after</v>

608
00:31:34.051 --> 00:31:34.884
<v Speaker 1>that you go into what some domed realm </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there appear to be entities </v>

609
00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:40.080
<v Speaker 1>communicating with you and what do </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say these?</v>

610
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about that bit.</v>

611
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.920
<v Speaker 4>That's a very interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's this kinda like there was</v>

612
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:46.763
<v Speaker 4>this transition from the space of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>geometries into this actual kind of </v>

613
00:31:49.831 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

614
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.803
<v Speaker 4>different sort of space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different realm that feels alive and it </v>

615
00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:57.690
<v Speaker 4>feels very true as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For many people.</v>

616
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the dose is high enough,</v>

617
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.563
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people kind of reliably go into this </v>

618
00:32:02.581 --> 00:32:06.440
<v Speaker 4>space and this space can be full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>color,</v>

619
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.310
<v Speaker 4>different objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily.</v>

620
00:32:08.311 --> 00:32:11.700
<v Speaker 4>You will get the same sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>shapes NTT.</v>

621
00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Some people speak about alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so people speak about Goblin.</v>

622
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Some people don't even speak about </v>
<v Speaker 4>visual evidence entities.</v>

623
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Just something being alive around you.</v>

624
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.113
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I suppose that would be </v>

625
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.460
<v Speaker 1>interpretive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>

626
00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:26.294
<v Speaker 1>he's been on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon amps still using a British </v>

627
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:30.450
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that when he.</v>

628
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.303
<v Speaker 1>He like with his experience with Ios guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said that he's described that </v>

629
00:32:34.431 --> 00:32:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the different people in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a group out of six people,</v>

630
00:32:36.741 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>he said and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

631
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of a secularized Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

632
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.253
<v Speaker 1>a experienced these guiding psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a Hindu person who hadn't </v>

633
00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.413
<v Speaker 1>experienced with Ganash and a Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who had Christ like divinity </v>

634
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.573
<v Speaker 1>needs an Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The divine comes to you in the form of </v>

635
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an image,</v>

636
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 1>which is really just a form of geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

637
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:56.654
<v Speaker 1>loose geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like everyone's having the same </v>

638
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>essential experience of there is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an authority,</v>

639
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 1>there is something accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

640
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Which you said there Chris and you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>also Robin,</v>

641
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe external may not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Well of course you're seeing Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just took it.</v>

643
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You just injected yourself with a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm full of delicious.</v>

644
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demo method.</v>

645
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.274
<v Speaker 1>Triptolene</v>

646
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.800
<v Speaker 4>they methylate tryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

647
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Say what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

648
00:33:19.651 --> 00:33:20.484
<v Speaker 1>Why do people think it might be external</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the consistency of the </v>

649
00:33:22.081 --> 00:33:22.620
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

650
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.970
<v Speaker 4>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting.</v>

651
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Definitely an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

652
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.060
<v Speaker 4>the thing is that it's always a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

653
00:33:30.061 --> 00:33:32.040
<v Speaker 4>it's an actual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Entering your body,</v>

654
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>costing these experiences,</v>

655
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 4>the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the experience of your wheel.</v>

656
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:36.944
<v Speaker 4>I mean feels three wheel and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's definitely something to </v>

657
00:33:39.991 --> 00:33:43.230
<v Speaker 4>respect people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People feel there's some authority.</v>

658
00:33:43.231 --> 00:33:44.064
<v Speaker 4>There's something external,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you knew or bow down in </v>

659
00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:50.040
<v Speaker 4>some sort of way you respect deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That being said,</v>

660
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.230
<v Speaker 4>it is something real or that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that exists to actually outside of realm</v>

662
00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:01.590
<v Speaker 4>of personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know these things.</v>

663
00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:02.424
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult to access them from a </v>

664
00:34:04.351 --> 00:34:06.850
<v Speaker 4>scientific point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

665
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.950
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>

666
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.110
<v Speaker 4>most things around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

667
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Inside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

668
00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.160
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most things,</v>

669
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.310
<v Speaker 2>most objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:34:12.311 --> 00:34:15.730
<v Speaker 2>most entities are outside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even when we dream,</v>

671
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 2>we think we're in a world where things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are outside of us,</v>

672
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that,</v>

673
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

674
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:23.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play if you want is being played out in </v>

675
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.093
<v Speaker 2>our minds and we know that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes in brain activity that account </v>

676
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:30.874
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a similar thing with </v>

677
00:34:31.241 --> 00:34:32.260
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

678
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.760
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

679
00:34:33.761 --> 00:34:38.020
<v Speaker 2>with very high reliability that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on a particular aspect of the brain</v>

680
00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that they work on a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitter system,</v>

681
00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:43.480
<v Speaker 2>a particular receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin receptor,</v>

682
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.370
<v Speaker 2>if you block it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't trip,</v>

683
00:34:45.371 --> 00:34:46.204
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the entities to really all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence is that it comes from the </v>

684
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:51.430
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes from the mind.</v>

685
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.750
<v Speaker 2>But there's a thing that humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they,</v>

686
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 2>they have an inclination to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to kind of externalize,</v>

687
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>know to project and say it's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The realm is,</v>

688
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.530
<v Speaker 2>is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another dimension.</v>

689
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.383
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these entities are actually aliens that </v>

690
00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:08.584
<v Speaker 2>come from wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've become certainly in a way </v>

691
00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:14.980
<v Speaker 2>overly sensual and overly materialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes our main interpretive tool is</v>

692
00:35:14.981 --> 00:35:15.814
<v Speaker 2>to regard phenomenon is external as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to internal possibly could </v>

693
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.433
<v Speaker 2>continually go to bias to see things </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this bias of externalizing and </v>

694
00:35:24.311 --> 00:35:26.650
<v Speaker 2>materializing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have this bias?</v>

695
00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:27.484
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have it?</v>

696
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.413
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm interested in so many things </v>

697
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:33.640
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly getting out of my neck,</v>

698
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd always have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very careful.</v>

699
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I've got</v>

700
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 2>great deal of respect and indeed fear of</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs because of the way that it made my</v>

701
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 2>life go or really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really badly wrong.</v>

702
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.193
<v Speaker 2>But like what I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of thing I think is the </v>

703
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:50.520
<v Speaker 2>exploration of this world now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you would,</v>

704
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.463
<v Speaker 2>under these clinical studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if illusions in the studies that </v>

705
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 2>yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were conducting and in previous</v>

706
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.220
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what part of the brain is being impacted</v>

707
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 2>and what can we learn from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

708
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.340
<v Speaker 2>well it starts with the serotonin system</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the molecules come in Serotonin,</v>

709
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 2>where else would we see that effect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's loads of it in the gut.</v>

710
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got a lot of,</v>

711
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 2>in our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't such a massive,</v>

712
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:15.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of relationship with </v>

713
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with those systems.</v>

714
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And people talk about visceral feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or is.</v>

715
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

716
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Gut Instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.813
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so serotonin is in the brain and it </v>

718
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.570
<v Speaker 2>modulates arrange range of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

719
00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>states of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

720
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 2>mood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we think.</v>

721
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.093
<v Speaker 2>And psychedelics kind of hijack the </v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin system in a certain aspect of </v>

722
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then kind of pickle a particular way</v>

723
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

724
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Cheeky little devil doesn't it again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to away on the systems.</v>

725
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the kind of broader level in</v>

726
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>terms of the whole of the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes networks in the brain.</v>

727
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:56.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's the way we tend to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about brain function these days.</v>

728
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:59.460
<v Speaker 2>We don't think of all this bit here does</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

729
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:00.294
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this distributed system that </v>

730
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:03.204
<v Speaker 2>often encompasses the whole of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bits at the front and bits at the </v>

731
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:06.740
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

732
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.603
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does something like know vision or </v>

733
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 2>movement or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

734
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.433
<v Speaker 2>This model of compartmentalization </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely come from the period of </v>

735
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:18.300
<v Speaker 2>industrialization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That of which a lot of these discoveries</v>

736
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 2>were made in when we saw mechanistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>models as being compartmentalized and as</v>

737
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:27.411
<v Speaker 2>we realized a time where our technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>is understood in terms of cybernetics,</v>

738
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 2>that we start to look at consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the brain as a comparable entity.</v>

739
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's unlikely that he was looking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the window button,</v>

740
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.850
<v Speaker 2>go to the toilet tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

741
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as DMRC would say,</v>

742
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 2>just the mind rules the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the body roll the mind?</v>

743
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I've done a little bit circular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

744
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:47.280
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one.</v>

745
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Where are these?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are these boundaries?</v>

746
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:50.274
<v Speaker 2>Where are these lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's drawing them in and for what </v>

747
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:54.170
<v Speaker 2>reason?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

748
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.023
<v Speaker 2>So like one of the things that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>is serotonin transmission and reception </v>

749
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 2>starts going all I knew real well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that creates a conditions of,</v>

750
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 2>of plasticity or a potential for change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

751
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.620
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those kind of looser conditions,</v>

752
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>the constraints on brain function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the brain's working,</v>

753
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

754
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:25.350
<v Speaker 2>are sort of lifted and the brain can </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate in a much freer away.</v>

755
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And what happens under those conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the brain networks that we know,</v>

756
00:38:31.141 --> 00:38:33.930
<v Speaker 2>that we know serve different functions </v>
<v Speaker 2>like vision,</v>

757
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:34.764
<v Speaker 2>like moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

758
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.990
<v Speaker 2>like high level things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even consciousness.</v>

759
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 2>They begin to break down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they begin to dissolve and disintegrate.</v>

760
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.263
<v Speaker 2>And when they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another interesting thing that happens </v>

761
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the whole of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these systems become less,</v>

762
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:51.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different from each other.</v>

763
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 2>They kind of start to blend in to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and those two things.</v>

764
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:56.644
<v Speaker 2>So the disintegration of networks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of coming together of networks </v>

765
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:02.910
<v Speaker 2>and the sort of blending relate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

766
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.753
<v Speaker 2>so we've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we think to some of the kind of </v>

767
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.720
<v Speaker 2>most abstract aspects of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of them is a,</v>

768
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 2>these reports of ego dissolution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about earlier,</v>

769
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you know that that sense that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative self,</v>

770
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:20.614
<v Speaker 2>you know who Russell is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is being compromised and you're just as </v>

771
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.573
<v Speaker 2>awake just as consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden that narrative self </v>

772
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 2>destruct away and the other one is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might feel when that happens,</v>

773
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fear,</v>

774
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.523
<v Speaker 2>but also if that's transcended a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of connecting to something bigger in a </v>

775
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 2>sense of connectedness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of oneness.</v>

776
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.393
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ego one's idea of a narrative it </v>

777
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 2>self as sort of a physical entity with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>story and a life in a perspective.</v>

778
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.470
<v Speaker 2>When that dissolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sense of connection and relief</v>

779
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:00.304
<v Speaker 2>and release that I do remember I took it</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think quite a lot for a while and </v>

780
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it felt very brilliant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and I enjoyed it.</v>

781
00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>But remember I wasn't taking it under </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory conditions.</v>

782
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I was taking it under the probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst conditions you could take it under</v>

783
00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.093
<v Speaker 2>ethics in the first case is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then sort of like hanging out in </v>

784
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:19.114
<v Speaker 2>like sort of people's bedsits in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross gate and like with people with </v>

785
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.450
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just young men and like you know,</v>

786
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:28.600
<v Speaker 2>that sort of 18 year old lads and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

787
00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not the worst thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me and check this out.</v>

788
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone sort of got a load of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid,</v>

789
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.253
<v Speaker 2>like sheets of the staff and I obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a very keen young drug user for that </v>

790
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.233
<v Speaker 2>are left that and went and swapped my </v>
<v Speaker 2>bike for a good sheet of it and like </v>

791
00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:44.074
<v Speaker 2>everyone pretended one night that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were all doing some and they all just </v>

792
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 2>get a little bit of paper which is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>form that it was delivered in and I took</v>

793
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:52.324
<v Speaker 2>real acid but they only had a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper in an hour in as Mike tripped </v>

794
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all go,</v>

795
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't take acid.</v>

796
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 2>So I'm now on a trip that requires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

797
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:05.170
<v Speaker 2>in laboratory conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust release and all of that.</v>

798
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And I'm told that none of the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them are doing it.</v>

799
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not happy that day.</v>

800
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it because I was starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

801
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:11.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

802
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.821
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

803
00:41:11.821 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an adolescent male so my identity is</v>

804
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.350
<v Speaker 2>forming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ego is a fragile thing.</v>

805
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.273
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the background that I came </v>

806
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>from and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember like feeling very,</v>

807
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 2>very disruptive and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frightened and very afraid.</v>

808
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:26.014
<v Speaker 2>I mean so that these psychedelic drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not things to be toyed around with </v>

809
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 2>lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's sort of this general</v>

810
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 2>awareness and sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Daniel Pinchbeck.</v>

811
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 2>He writes</v>

812
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.993
<v Speaker 1>a lot about sort of taken different </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant by plant medicines and stuff and </v>

813
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:40.260
<v Speaker 1>different cultures and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

814
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.133
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially revolutionary information </v>

815
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 1>held in these plant substances.</v>

816
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that and people have said </v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychedelics are kind of,</v>

817
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are kind of apart from other drugs</v>

818
00:41:55.381 --> 00:41:57.120
<v Speaker 2>and there's a bit of evidence to support</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

819
00:41:57.121 --> 00:41:59.970
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big population study in theU ,</v>

820
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.913
<v Speaker 2>s looked at united some 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and then looked at patterns of </v>

821
00:42:04.351 --> 00:42:05.184
<v Speaker 2>drug use and the relationship to mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and found the psychedelics stood </v>

822
00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:11.700
<v Speaker 2>out like a sore thumb because all other </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

823
00:42:11.701 --> 00:42:13.920
<v Speaker 2>the more you take the worse your mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

824
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.053
<v Speaker 2>But psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more he took the lower was </v>

825
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.490
<v Speaker 2>psychological distress and the lower was</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidality.</v>

826
00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:21.324
<v Speaker 2>The two measures that they looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people have questioned whether you </v>

827
00:42:24.871 --> 00:42:29.610
<v Speaker 2>can even call psychedelics recreational </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs because at least in principle they</v>

828
00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:30.444
<v Speaker 2>should have been taken for recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe self exploration or therapeutic </v>

829
00:42:34.201 --> 00:42:35.850
<v Speaker 2>work but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:42:35.851 --> 00:42:37.320
<v Speaker 2>not a party or</v>

831
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.221
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

832
00:42:38.221 --> 00:42:39.054
<v Speaker 1>because I remember black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my impulse in taking those substances </v>

833
00:42:40.951 --> 00:42:43.830
<v Speaker 1>when I was in fact in all drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to get out of myself.</v>

834
00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:44.664
<v Speaker 1>I've felt like trapped and him sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pain and like also the other thing </v>

835
00:42:48.301 --> 00:42:49.134
<v Speaker 1>curiously that felt is what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing is reality is not the </v>

836
00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 1>ultimate reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something else I wanted that.</v>

837
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:55.923
<v Speaker 1>So I kept puffing loads of weed then </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking loads and doing enough for </v>

838
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.640
<v Speaker 1>drugs and eventually I'm going to crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>and heroin addict,</v>

839
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.900
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that had this odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent and what do I want to say,</v>

840
00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:06.120
<v Speaker 1>sort of like uncanny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost macabre.</v>

841
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel it even when we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

842
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.043
<v Speaker 1>when I start to feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tendrils that connects me to my </v>

843
00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:13.434
<v Speaker 1>personal self flexing and being tugged </v>
<v Speaker 1>because something in me knows there is </v>

844
00:43:18.091 --> 00:43:22.740
<v Speaker 1>another world and it's difficult because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the domain primarily of religion to</v>

845
00:43:22.741 --> 00:43:25.470
<v Speaker 1>say that the material world is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>

846
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.690
<v Speaker 1>None of this stuff really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all one.</v>

847
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.553
<v Speaker 1>These tropes are found in religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you're doing is bringing these </v>

848
00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:37.671
<v Speaker 1>ideas are exploring these ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia and in chemistry and he,</v>

849
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and it seems it's sort of somewhat laden</v>
<v Speaker 1>with taboo and prohibition.</v>

850
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Even within your field I've sent you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're both cautious about talking about</v>

851
00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it in a personal way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

852
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot different aspects there.</v>

853
00:43:52.561 --> 00:43:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

854
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

855
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the stigma is a massive thing.</v>

856
00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like we're kind of</v>

857
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.730
<v Speaker 2>walking a very thin line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.593
<v Speaker 2>you've got the enthusiasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on one side the psychedelic </v>

859
00:44:06.331 --> 00:44:08.850
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic that might look in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

860
00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:10.530
<v Speaker 2>these guys are so dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the such,</v>

861
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such scientists,</v>

862
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're boring or whatever,</v>

863
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got the way that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

864
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 2>And then we've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.920
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

866
00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:24.000
<v Speaker 2>you look in and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

867
00:44:24.001 --> 00:44:25.980
<v Speaker 2>they're not real scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They study psychedelics,</v>

868
00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:28.110
<v Speaker 2>they must be hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they'd take closer psychedelics.</v>

869
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's a really sort of difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>line to walk and personally,</v>

870
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major motivation is to try and broaden</v>

871
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 2>that walkway in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 2>to kind of eat into some of the mystical</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects.</v>

873
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.900
<v Speaker 2>And although people won't like this kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of secularized them and,</v>

874
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.960
<v Speaker 2>and I don't see that as a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although some people will see it as kind</v>

875
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.680
<v Speaker 2>of bridge building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.983
<v Speaker 2>and translation like it really needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a Rosetta stone of the spiritual </v>

877
00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:01.611
<v Speaker 2>experience to the material experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>because materialism is our dogma.</v>

878
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to get information </v>
<v Speaker 2>over?</v>

879
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make it dogmatic,</v>

880
00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:08.963
<v Speaker 2>personally I wouldn't ever want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>depreciate things like an entity </v>

882
00:45:12.121 --> 00:45:12.954
<v Speaker 2>experience and I think something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes people are threatened by </v>

883
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:16.411
<v Speaker 2>it and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

884
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:17.244
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to explain away this </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that changed my life or </v>

885
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

886
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 2>you want to say it's all brain activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't personally,</v>

888
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:27.624
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather allow that way of looking at </v>

889
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 2>things to just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

890
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation would say.</v>

891
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell it happens,</v>

892
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

893
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 2>and so for me it's not explaining away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just explaining.</v>

894
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:45.384
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the wonder of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still is magical and beautiful,</v>

896
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

897
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>whether you understand how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how a tree grows or whatever.</v>

898
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:55.703
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And regard and however far one goes </v>

899
00:45:57.331 --> 00:45:58.164
<v Speaker 2>materialistically mechanistically for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever scientific discipline one is </v>

900
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:02.400
<v Speaker 2>still left with the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

901
00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

902
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:04.763
<v Speaker 2>What's motivating this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it Ctda what in thrones this </v>

903
00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 2>procedure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're right,</v>

904
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.234
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you entirely that the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there can be description and </v>

905
00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 2>translation of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more it will benefit it's advanced.</v>

906
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 2>What's your personal motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying out these studies?</v>

907
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to achieve?</v>

908
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.013
<v Speaker 2>Education is one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd like it to be more normalized </v>

909
00:46:32.671 --> 00:46:33.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and less,</v>

910
00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

911
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Easter terrick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious mind that it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's taught to kids even,</v>

913
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:42.534
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that will help to broaden our </v>

914
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.593
<v Speaker 2>population's consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about unconscious unconscious in a </v>

915
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:51.001
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

916
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>

917
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and often quite healthy cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

919
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

920
00:46:58.471 --> 00:46:59.304
<v Speaker 2>it's less taboo and maybe some of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of parcel eating is something that </v>

921
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 2>the western people have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>particularly sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.270
<v Speaker 2>zealously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a motivation to normalize</v>

925
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.520
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want psychedelics,</v>

926
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:15.354
<v Speaker 2>the vso esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the unconscious mind and </v>

927
00:47:17.491 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis to be so unusual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo and stigmatized,</v>

928
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a motivation to,</v>

929
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 2>to bring it into the mainstream and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>get people talking about it and thinking</v>

931
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>about it and I think in being more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious for ourselves,</v>

932
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.700
<v Speaker 1>we're less likely to perhaps harm </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and others.</v>

933
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.953
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very beautiful and important </v>

934
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.433
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm intrigued by it because I feel that </v>

935
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:50.430
<v Speaker 1>we are all to content to dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity that we all experience,</v>

936
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:52.744
<v Speaker 1>like we all do dream every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This amazing thing that happens in </v>

937
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:58.290
<v Speaker 1>everyone's mind most days and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

938
00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.980
<v Speaker 1>crack on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay The gas bill.</v>

939
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll know mortgage rates have gone up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for let's have another foreign war.</v>

940
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.473
<v Speaker 1>And every night all of us tumble into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some glorious world of wonder where our </v>

941
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.004
<v Speaker 1>own life is rerender there's a myth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the information that's in there is </v>

942
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:13.444
<v Speaker 1>somehow ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the fact that there is </v>

943
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>obviously sort of potential to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand ourselves differently.</v>

944
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.900
<v Speaker 1>A book that I have written is it about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.833
<v Speaker 1>sort of is about how my method of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery that I was given the 12 step </v>

946
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:32.221
<v Speaker 1>method was a way of recognizing that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>model I had of myself was ineffective,</v>

947
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:33.723
<v Speaker 1>was an ineffective way of living and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I needed to go on a journey of </v>

948
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 1>being a different kind of man to succeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

949
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is that prohibition around </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

950
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:44.464
<v Speaker 1>prohibition around substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I find it very difficult to </v>

951
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:48.094
<v Speaker 1>regard the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when you talk about this </v>

952
00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:49.774
<v Speaker 1>period of inception in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as parental and loving when so many </v>

953
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:55.624
<v Speaker 1>of its aims and objectives have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently revealed to be the </v>

954
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.203
<v Speaker 1>mendacious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there like it's likely that </v>

955
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 1>prohibition around psychedelics shares </v>
<v Speaker 1>that objective,</v>

956
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:12.750
<v Speaker 1>but if more people experience this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably like shamanism,</v>

957
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.133
<v Speaker 1>culturally is not for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody in the tribe goes off </v>

958
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 1>every bloody day and wanders around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

959
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 1>all realms and in the unconscious mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is expected to interpret it.</v>

960
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Different types of people have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of abilities,</v>

961
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but some people should be experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of the unconscious and</v>

962
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:35.500
<v Speaker 1>all of us should have a different way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>relating to ourselves in totality,</v>

963
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well I'm just this boat.</v>

964
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And then like deathbed lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have done more by.</v>

965
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I'd love me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just simply couldn't cope.</v>

966
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.793
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

967
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 1>like what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me,</v>

968
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>what is the ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing intention for these studies?</v>

969
00:49:52.391 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

970
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:55.320
<v Speaker 1>we do more clinical work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

971
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.193
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at psilocybin magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms as a treatment for depression </v>

972
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:01.623
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done that already and got an idea </v>

973
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 1>that it works and some idea of how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

974
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.860
<v Speaker 1>but now probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that serotonin stuff,</v>

975
00:50:08.861 --> 00:50:09.694
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Serotonin and it works on those </v>

976
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:13.380
<v Speaker 1>networks I was talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

977
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

978
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and sort of reset mechanism as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be going on,</v>

979
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:19.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's curious what like the narrative </v>

980
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 1>can be interrupted thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

981
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not happening now.</v>

982
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being abused now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you can kind of scramble up </v>

983
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 1>and dissolve</v>

984
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it comes back,</v>

985
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it comes back like a malfunctioning </v>

986
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 2>computer is rebooted and it comes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's functioning again normally.</v>

987
00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

988
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 2>that's something to test more as we go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

989
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:41.263
<v Speaker 2>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you had some negative stuff then </v>

990
00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:44.540
<v Speaker 2>having to have somebody go proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>crackers?</v>

991
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

992
00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

993
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.510
<v Speaker 2>it can be nightmarish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

994
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:49.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can have patients whaling during the </v>

995
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 2>session when they're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

996
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.640
<v Speaker 2>facing demons and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

997
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come back and they go,</v>

998
00:50:59.301 --> 00:51:00.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

999
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.650
<v Speaker 2>This thing got me where I was abused as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid and that just really lived it.</v>

1000
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

1001
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1002
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:10.691
<v Speaker 2>and so they need to feel like they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go there and this has literally happened</v>

1003
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.780
<v Speaker 2>that killed himself or anything mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:13.521
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1005
00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1006
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.953
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the experience itself is incredibly </v>

1007
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>challenging.</v>

1008
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.553
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine it being traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced it to be traumatic </v>

1009
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.960
<v Speaker 2>staring around in your own unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be traumatic.</v>

1010
00:51:22.961 --> 00:51:25.120
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of crap mine around in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and addressed,</v>

1011
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1012
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.593
<v Speaker 2>just someone having a traumatic time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't necessarily a negative thing </v>

1013
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.493
<v Speaker 2>because at least you're living it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there can be breakthrough and so </v>

1014
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:33.884
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing and we encourage the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients to look the demons in the eye </v>

1015
00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:41.060
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes those demons are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of an abuser say and when</v>

1016
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:46.061
<v Speaker 2>they do that they get this curious like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift in perspective and they'll see the</v>

1017
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:49.250
<v Speaker 2>abuser as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost as a victim,</v>

1018
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can sort of see the chain of </v>

1019
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>causality that led to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1020
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.733
<v Speaker 2>being so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage that they would do something </v>

1021
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.693
<v Speaker 2>damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These results can be achieved </v>

1022
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Speaker 2>therapeutically.</v>

1023
00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.143
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the reframing in sort of say </v>

1024
00:52:02.851 --> 00:52:06.590
<v Speaker 2>neuro linguistic programming would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like looking at the perpetrator of</v>

1025
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 2>abuse as themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you say a victim like that,</v>

1026
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:11.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you cook,</v>

1027
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:12.644
<v Speaker 2>but I'm imagining you could probably do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot quicker with a healthy dose </v>

1028
00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 2>of psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that,</v>

1029
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famously said about psychedelics that </v>

1030
00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 2>they can be like years of therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1031
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:22.874
<v Speaker 2>in a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The danger is you always feel like we </v>

1032
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:26.834
<v Speaker 2>should put a caveat on it because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked a lot about the environment and </v>

1033
00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:32.530
<v Speaker 2>the context and I do think it's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

1034
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.800
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wrong context,</v>

1035
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:34.634
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics could be harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Person was mentally unwell in inverted </v>

1036
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:45.491
<v Speaker 2>commerce is probably not a good idea to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take any mind altering substances alone.</v>

1037
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.893
<v Speaker 2>And I think my personal belief is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the addiction phenomena is a result of </v>

1038
00:52:51.261 --> 00:52:52.094
<v Speaker 2>people medicating themselves in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society that doesn't know how to treat </v>

1039
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>them and has no real desire to take care</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mentally ill.</v>

1040
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking because I was in pain and</v>

1041
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:02.234
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't cope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And curiously the other thing is I </v>

1042
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:04.544
<v Speaker 2>already said was I had a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity about what was going on in my </v>

1043
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:10.040
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience.</v>

1044
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:11.043
<v Speaker 2>A colleague of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Rosalind Watson has done some nice </v>

1045
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:15.160
<v Speaker 2>work around this theme of connectedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1046
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.980
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of mental disorders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably addiction.</v>

1047
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:19.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people suffer from a feeling of being </v>

1048
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:25.270
<v Speaker 2>isolated and being disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and they might be disconnected or</v>

1049
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.113
<v Speaker 2>say for meaning</v>

1050
00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:26.973
<v Speaker 1>united does a sense of meaninglessness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what seems to happen with </v>

1051
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there is a breakthrough,</v>

1052
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>is that people feel this strong sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnection.</v>

1053
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.063
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know on a personal level </v>
<v Speaker 1>what experience used to have of people </v>

1054
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:46.221
<v Speaker 1>in recovery taking these subsidiaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm in recovery.</v>

1055
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know about people with five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1056
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:51.900
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years plus in recovery from drugs and</v>

1057
00:53:51.901 --> 00:53:55.830
<v Speaker 1>alcohol using these substances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going off and relapse in and</v>

1058
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.693
<v Speaker 1>holding up a gas station and kicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>over some bins on their way out of the </v>

1059
00:53:59.641 --> 00:54:00.474
<v Speaker 1>lab there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence that psychedelics </v>

1060
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:05.050
<v Speaker 1>promote relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1061
00:54:05.051 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Speaker 1>and like I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1062
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:08.440
<v Speaker 1>they kind of are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1063
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs apart from other drugs in a way,</v>

1064
00:54:11.141 --> 00:54:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not more wish than not addictive</v>

1065
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 1>in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1066
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.553
<v Speaker 1>after psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often say either never again or </v>

1067
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 1>not for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1068
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 1>even if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's transformative and euphoric,</v>

1069
00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.253
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually have to go through a tough </v>

1070
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 1>time to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not hedonic drugs really,</v>

1071
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not hedonic.</v>

1072
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1073
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us some of your greatest hit.</v>

1074
00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things people have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things people have come back</v>

1075
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

1076
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:43.464
<v Speaker 1>Chris too.</v>

1077
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1078
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1079
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I have one of our last participant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1080
00:54:53.841 --> 00:54:55.230
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1081
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.083
<v Speaker 4>she was going through the pace of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place of the geometry you see pushed </v>

1082
00:54:58.491 --> 00:54:59.324
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she couldn't push through any </v>

1083
00:55:01.911 --> 00:55:04.310
<v Speaker 4>further because there were some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1084
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.453
<v Speaker 4>is not letting her go by and somehow a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit kind of like punishing her because </v>

1085
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 4>of the audacity of going into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>realm.</v>

1086
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1087
00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:18.380
<v Speaker 4>so that was quite scary for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1088
00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:20.660
<v Speaker 4>So this kind of like first entity </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter,</v>

1089
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.540
<v Speaker 4>but then slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slowly she started,</v>

1090
00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:24.374
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like going through this haze of </v>

1091
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.390
<v Speaker 4>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1092
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.233
<v Speaker 4>and then they were entities like </v>
<v Speaker 4>chanting all around her and healing her </v>

1093
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.230
<v Speaker 4>as she came back from the experience.</v>

1094
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.753
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless the clinical conditions and the </v>

1096
00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:47.724
<v Speaker 1>clinical conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still undecided because I live my </v>

1097
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 1>life one day at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1098
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:52.090
<v Speaker 1>That sounds pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1099
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean even just the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in your unconscious mind.</v>

1100
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean dreams are in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidence.</v>

1101
00:55:57.661 --> 00:55:58.494
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to take drugs to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff going on in your </v>

1102
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:02.070
<v Speaker 1>unconscious mind that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1103
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.380
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at your own hand right now.</v>

1104
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Some things pumping blood into it in not</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind isn't deciding,</v>

1105
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.113
<v Speaker 1>so we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are continual evidence of our own </v>

1106
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:13.170
<v Speaker 1>unconscious activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

1107
00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:14.004
<v Speaker 1>the idea of these narratives and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of external phenomena being </v>

1108
00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 1>experienced not via the material world </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the central world,</v>

1109
00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but via some kind of other tellier </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

1110
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:26.223
<v Speaker 1>Is that the right word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some other teleology like there is </v>

1111
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:32.950
<v Speaker 1>momentum and receipt of data without </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the material world.</v>

1112
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I liked the sounds of that very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much because that seems like,</v>

1113
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people say,</v>

1114
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:39.304
<v Speaker 1>the reason the world's not changing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of a lack of vision because no </v>

1115
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:42.334
<v Speaker 1>one's got a better idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that we live in a political </v>

1116
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:45.004
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk forms of management and shift of a </v>

1117
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:47.284
<v Speaker 1>percent here or there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the things that are interesting in </v>

1118
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:50.104
<v Speaker 1>politics or about kindness and love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and oneness and socialism is </v>

1119
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all one.</v>

1120
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.180
<v Speaker 1>We should look after each other and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose capitalism is just do the bloody</v>

1121
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 1>best jacare where water got so like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there could be new data,</v>

1122
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 1>new information and empirical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think is important that</v>

1123
00:57:04.991 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you're building material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical,</v>

1124
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.863
<v Speaker 1>empirical bridges because the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is another vision within each of </v>

1125
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way of being,</v>

1126
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 1>another version of yourself waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be realized.</v>

1127
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1128
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.413
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got anything else for me and </v>

1129
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:21.563
<v Speaker 1>you have stories of stuff you've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about when Terence Mckenna is </v>

1130
00:57:23.531 --> 00:57:24.364
<v Speaker 1>saying that he's seeing and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this idea about like some of the </v>

1131
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 1>things I heard two things on youtube I </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>

1132
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 1>One was a Peruvian Shaman who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1133
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've worked with plants in his</v>

1134
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 1>capacity as a shaman being given dmt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical conditions.</v>

1135
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 1>And he described exactly as you did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1136
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:41.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodily sensation,</v>

1137
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the sensation of fort speeding up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea then thought stopping then</v>

1138
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.860
<v Speaker 1>this sort of personal sense of death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1139
00:57:47.861 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've ruined the,</v>

1140
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.550
<v Speaker 1>messed up the dosage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die.</v>

1141
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.593
<v Speaker 1>And then realizing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in fact personal death or death </v>

1142
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:55.564
<v Speaker 1>of the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sort of encountering other </v>

1143
00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 1>entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1144
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I love the sound of that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1145
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Bloody terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he talked about is the</v>

1146
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 1>loss of time that he said that on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>way back from the experience,</v>

1147
00:58:06.551 --> 00:58:07.384
<v Speaker 1>if it goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably been gone for thousands of </v>

1148
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:09.603
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope there's some of my descendants </v>

1149
00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:14.020
<v Speaker 1>alive came back and he sort of said to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions or anyone alive and.</v>

1150
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's been gone 10 minutes mate.</v>

1151
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So like a dmt experience is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is 10 minutes or something.</v>

1152
00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually much less intense but </v>

1153
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.200
<v Speaker 1>intense Buddhist like five minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even three,</v>

1154
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:30.843
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are in a realm where sort of the </v>

1155
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:32.824
<v Speaker 1>rules of the material world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical world seemed to abate and you </v>

1156
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 1>experience things that are beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own understanding,</v>

1157
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 1>beyond your own limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1158
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I liked that Terence </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna said,</v>

1159
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1160
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if those were to land on the White House</v>

1161
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.083
<v Speaker 1>South Lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be less impressive than what's </v>

1162
00:58:50.021 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>happened happened in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1163
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Your own consciousness on dmt reveals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1164
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.073
<v Speaker 1>But everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understand the limitations and </v>

1165
00:58:57.011 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 1>prohibitions as the material and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical world are,</v>

1166
00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:04.321
<v Speaker 1>but one frequency of being but one modem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality within us all.</v>

1167
00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 1>There's this sort of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentiality.</v>

1168
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:12.070
<v Speaker 1>An interesting interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have,</v>

1169
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a Bunsen burner or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaker full of alkaline think.</v>

1170
00:59:18.411 --> 00:59:19.244
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this break down enough to </v>

1171
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 1>where you're seeing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this</v>

1172
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 4>is a really interesting thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned that at some point.</v>

1173
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:26.504
<v Speaker 4>I mean this idea of transitioning into </v>
<v Speaker 4>another mode of being can be very </v>

1174
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:30.524
<v Speaker 4>healing in itself as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is something that's </v>

1175
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 4>really striking about the experience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

1176
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people build this very intense narrative</v>

1177
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 4>around them as well.</v>

1178
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1179
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 2>you could tell already that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1180
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.810
<v Speaker 2>we've got a slight bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least speaking for myself,</v>

1181
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:50.963
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even though it might feel like you </v>

1183
00:59:52.531 --> 00:59:55.920
<v Speaker 2>transcend the physical and material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1184
00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what to do because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no real evidence for that.</v>

1185
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.120
<v Speaker 2>And what is the physical material in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these terms,</v>

1186
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it mean to transcend it?</v>

1187
01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>totality that the idea,</v>

1188
01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:09.144
<v Speaker 2>even the paradigm or the template that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggests material and transcendence of </v>

1189
01:00:13.411 --> 01:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it materialistic or a limited idea?</v>

1190
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I suppose psychologically things have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological reality that in a way,</v>

1191
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1192
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>or a different way of looking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding things.</v>

1193
01:00:27.751 --> 01:00:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Then then looking at the biology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1194
01:00:30.151 --> 01:00:33.750
<v Speaker 2>looking at the biology is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an objective perspective and you look</v>

1195
01:00:33.751 --> 01:00:34.584
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1196
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1197
01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:36.844
<v Speaker 2>this other perspective of feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences inherently subjective and </v>

1198
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1199
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.870
<v Speaker 2>It is hard to reconcile those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

1200
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.713
<v Speaker 2>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a sort of started to get a bit </v>

1201
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.670
<v Speaker 2>philosophical with terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like an inevitable journalism,</v>

1202
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a psychological reality to</v>

1203
01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:54.534
<v Speaker 2>these experiences that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and patsy shouldn't try and explain a </v>

1204
01:00:58.011 --> 01:00:58.844
<v Speaker 2>way with biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can let them both sit next to </v>

1205
01:01:02.011 --> 01:01:04.200
<v Speaker 2>each other and say when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
01:01:04.201 --> 01:01:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I do know what maps onto that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that experience,</v>

1207
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.293
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.600
<v Speaker 2>and then you know it and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try and,</v>

1209
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:13.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shatter a present sort of paradigms in </v>

1210
01:01:18.961 --> 01:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>science and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1211
01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:20.984
<v Speaker 2>and you have this belief hypothesis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually these breakthroughs into </v>

1212
01:01:25.141 --> 01:01:29.070
<v Speaker 2>another realm are actually literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>true and that you know,</v>

1213
01:01:29.071 --> 01:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>that there are other dimensions and such</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1214
01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.650
<v Speaker 2>then you've got a hypothesis and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and try and test it.</v>

1215
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't,</v>

1216
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.990
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done that yet.</v>

1217
01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Leave something in there and I bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>something back from it.</v>

1218
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1219
01:01:45.191 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting what I'm talking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

1220
01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned at the beginning the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a collective unconscious.</v>

1221
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the defining union idea is there</v>

1222
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:57.833
<v Speaker 1>in the work that you've done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics over your professional </v>

1223
01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:01.744
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an interesting consistency </v>

1224
01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.950
<v Speaker 1>across substances and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that suggest that there is a</v>

1225
01:02:08.951 --> 01:02:11.710
<v Speaker 1>commonality to the conscious experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people using these</v>

1226
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 2>substances?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1227
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1228
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess one unifying,</v>

1229
01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1230
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the experience is this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1231
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1232
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.110
<v Speaker 2>myself was a construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:31.944
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was built up that it's not </v>

1234
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 2>absolutely real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1235
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.823
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's common to everyone and then when </v>

1236
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 2>that is transcended another common </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that,</v>

1237
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role,</v>

1238
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants that drug.</v>

1239
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1240
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>we're all one drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better go to work.</v>

1241
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid I'm not going to pay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgage.</v>

1242
01:02:58.271 --> 01:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Why you need to achieve more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what reason?</v>

1243
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly presents a lot of questions</v>

1244
01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that might be challenging to keeping a </v>
<v Speaker 1>population behaving in a certain way.</v>

1245
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

1246
01:03:10.811 --> 01:03:14.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interesting stories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're a ttl,</v>

1247
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the skin.</v>

1248
01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.773
<v Speaker 1>A name of this show has ever been more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pertinent because a subcutaneous glance </v>

1249
01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>at these inner world suggests the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for huge,</v>

1250
01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>huge change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so grateful to both of you,</v>

1251
01:03:28.301 --> 01:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Robin and Chris for coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining,</v>

1252
01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.123
<v Speaker 1>albeit in some cases tentatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but importantly very professionally and </v>

1253
01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I think still within the confines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia,</v>

1254
01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:37.923
<v Speaker 1>something that sounds like a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful mystery and when the Great </v>

1255
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Brian Cox talks about physics is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery and the wonder and the glory and</v>

1256
01:03:45.101 --> 01:03:45.934
<v Speaker 1>our attempts to understand and explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>it this fascinating in all forms of </v>

1257
01:03:48.581 --> 01:03:49.414
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to consciousness </v>

1258
01:03:50.471 --> 01:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one more phenomena,</v>

1259
01:03:52.841 --> 01:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but the crucible of all phenomena is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>

1260
01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>deeply fascinating.</v>
