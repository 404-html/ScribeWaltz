1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Part of the documentary that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad is there though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want there,</v>

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't the producer and I gave all the</v>

4
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>rights to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way to be fair with it.</v>

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>The producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I worked with a young woman,</v>

6
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.074
<v Speaker 1>you may remember who was this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in a cult where they abused as </v>

7
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number four,</v>

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Dev sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was</v>

9
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that blew you away.</v>

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 2>That that was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

11
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 2>cause it was moved by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was at,</v>

12
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 2>when I say the bit where you see you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the room when you've got a little bit of</v>

13
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 2>downtime and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really blew you away.</v>

14
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.423
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people don't see that in me because </v>

15
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>if I'm crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're helping her,</v>

16
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>which I did the two with good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I,</v>

17
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able help her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

18
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it comes through me and then afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go and I feel the grace of that.</v>

19
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:39.364
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's often tears when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so beautiful when someone's life has </v>

20
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:42.484
<v Speaker 1>been touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I figured out what I did so I </v>

21
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>can do it again or teach someone else.</v>

22
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to sage with that energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're like,</v>

23
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking hell.</v>

24
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>That was a bit heavy but that our new </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

25
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>so I love what I do for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as intense for a start.</v>

26
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian or entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm up there for an hour and a half,</v>

27
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

28
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:00.994
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I've got to do is make him love and </v>

29
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But afterwards,</v>

30
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 2>like I come home and I sort of crawl </v>
<v Speaker 2>into bed and just like,</v>

31
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to be told they're there.</v>

32
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 2>You're all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a good boy.</v>

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I need to be told.</v>

34
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.093
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of is that like if you got </v>

35
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 2>access to that level of vulnerability in</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

36
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I like this cause it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my love bug me.</v>

37
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.291
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.124
<v Speaker 2>what do I have only seen a documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had a bit of a chat based things to </v>

39
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.374
<v Speaker 2>me that you will very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very traumatic job and we're not </v>

40
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:25.744
<v Speaker 2>nourished in the way that you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had to turn yourself into your </v>

41
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 2>own nutritional source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

42
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And now you're trying to solve all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's problems.</v>

43
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one individual at a time.</v>

44
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I've been in rooms where there's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

45
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.053
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of intensity because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of actually,</v>

47
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.194
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.273
<v Speaker 2>prior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the earlier chat you told me like </v>

49
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.064
<v Speaker 2>that they put all that athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring equipment on you and said </v>

50
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:48.454
<v Speaker 2>that you burned 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories in nine hours and your heart's </v>

51
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 2>doing this and your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

52
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.593
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that in the ability of </v>

53
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and we'll to alter anatomy</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a material to a degree.</v>

54
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>But the simple fact is it ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>

55
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

56
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.510
<v Speaker 2>where are you going with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability?</v>

57
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you got like a mentor?</v>

58
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Someone that you can call?</v>

59
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Not many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've what's really beautiful,</v>

60
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grace of my life is I've been called</v>

61
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>to help others and they look at me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their coach,</v>

62
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:16.754
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of people I have the privilege </v>

63
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>of coaching to think I'm just coaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

64
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I go there just like I did with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to interview.</v>

65
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:24.194
<v Speaker 1>I reached out to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately you want to chat with me </v>

66
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was grateful for,</v>

67
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.763
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to reach you because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a very special voice when it </v>

68
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>comes to recovery that I have not seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

69
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 1>So you have a passion and a truth and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and I have a lot of that,</v>

70
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:37.604
<v Speaker 1>but I'm only one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm good at finding brilliant people </v>

71
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.234
<v Speaker 1>and then helping to pull out so other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can see at least the people that </v>

72
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I have an audience for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>20 million people on social media and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk to people,</v>

74
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully it reaches even more.</v>

75
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm always on the hunt for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence.</v>

76
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the hunt for someone who's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My vulnerability is absolutely there.</v>

77
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:56.774
<v Speaker 1>But I've trained myself like an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most common question I've been </v>

78
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>asked by the media my entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always makes me laugh is,</v>

79
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you have bad days?</v>

80
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
<v Speaker 1>Don't you have days when you're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh state and desired and pissed off </v>

81
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and you watch TV and eat cheetos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch pornography?</v>

82
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.121
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I do some of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I do.</v>

84
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>But what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an athlete.</v>

85
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I built muscle over the years so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that they don't have feelings,</v>

86
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't get hurt her of the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pie for all those things,</v>

87
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>but they're not the dominant force in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

88
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.063
<v Speaker 1>It's a muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind is a muscle emotion as a </v>

89
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

90
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.303
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most powerful muscles are </v>

91
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>the invisible force muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your spiritual,</v>

92
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>emotional muscles like courage on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't grow,</v>

93
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put my ass on the line regularly so</v>

94
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:36.964
<v Speaker 1>that it grows and what keeps growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pretty soon the stuff that used to </v>

95
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>make me crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't touch me.</v>

96
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I'm so great just I'm well</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained.</v>

97
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I trained his mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up every morning in my life.</v>

98
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.283
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about rebound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her more crazy shit ideas everywhere in </v>

99
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.014
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm near,</v>

100
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>if I'm near any of my homes and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>places I have,</v>

101
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.373
<v Speaker 1>I have cryotherapy but my homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have these coal punches and our 56 </v>

102
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.544
<v Speaker 1>degrees and the first thing I do is jump</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their coal point so there's not a </v>

103
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>fucking morning where I want to jump in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can't remember.</v>

104
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>More intact could jump on that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't negotiate with myself.</v>

105
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I do it for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

106
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical health component </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves your lymph system ever.</v>

107
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The blood flushes through your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

108
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but the main reason I do it even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that is when I got up there,</v>

109
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't get how people negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to tomorrow I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this or oh,</v>

111
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>let me like two more minutes till I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready Earth.</v>

112
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>None of that shit with me for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

113
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I say do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to discuss the shit with my</v>

114
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind and their soul and spirit and</v>

115
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>soul and spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Soul fucking knows.</v>

116
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And when I say jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking jump.</v>

117
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to have a discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

118
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.753
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that happen with my water every </v>

119
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:38.711
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

120
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>because I've conditioned it.</v>

121
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Does it happen every of my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

122
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And when I find it's not working and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped back up and condition it,</v>

123
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.283
<v Speaker 1>and unless I'm willing to take a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent responsibility for what I feel </v>

124
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.484
<v Speaker 1>and what I experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm always going to be a victim to </v>

125
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:50.854
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's always going to be </v>

126
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>somebody's upset in the world we live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>today about something you said or did or</v>

127
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>didn't say or didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

128
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>There is no victory in the world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a voice and not everybody's</v>

129
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>voices necessarily designed to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody feel loved.</v>

130
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>It's designed to meet whatever their </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs are in that moment,</v>

131
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>they might want certainty and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a certain way makes them uncertain</v>

132
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.274
<v Speaker 1>or they think you're significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may think they're totally </v>

133
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

134
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>So they're mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't live my life that way.</v>

135
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>So I live my life where I keep learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep growing,</v>

136
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.143
<v Speaker 1>I keep loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep laughing and I'm trying to leave </v>

137
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:21.754
<v Speaker 1>a decent legacy of a meaningful life by </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly looking for ways that can be </v>

138
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my prayer,</v>

139
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>simple prayer before I walk on at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage is use me,</v>

140
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.890
<v Speaker 1>use me Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

141
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you get out of the way,</v>

142
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>my greatest gift is getting out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

143
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds silly to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really true.</v>

144
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.094
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an ultra religious person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm extremely spiritual and I </v>

145
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>believe the force of life comes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

146
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It comes through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes through all of us,</v>

147
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:46.264
<v Speaker 1>and the only gets in the way is all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs we have of how it's supposed to </v>

148
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the expectations we have.</v>

149
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And I have them too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I keep leading them out.</v>

150
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.063
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give you the impression </v>

151
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:56.134
<v Speaker 1>that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't have challenges and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

153
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>but I have a hell of a lot fewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot more.</v>

154
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>When something happens like this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

155
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.224
<v Speaker 1>oh worthy opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in every story of a person's </v>

156
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have what they want and desire.</v>

157
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And then they have these needs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unaware of,</v>

158
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>character things that need to be </v>

159
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do those get developed?</v>

160
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you wanted,</v>

161
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you just took action happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey you'd be bored.</v>

162
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Be you've never developed spiritually or</v>
<v Speaker 1>your character.</v>

163
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:20.594
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is opponent show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the opponent can be you with </v>

164
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.734
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opponent can be somebody close to </v>

165
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>you that feels like a bone or it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an external force.</v>

166
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>But if you do battle with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually you badly with yourself.</v>

167
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you can solve it within </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

168
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>you can what we're to what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside world.</v>

169
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>You can have that sense that your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful.</v>

170
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.974
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been battling for 58 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to keep doing battle the </v>

171
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:44.260
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

172
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing better cause I've done battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>so often.</v>

173
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like why is Lebron James who he is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because he's lucky,</v>

174
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.223
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I say?</v>

175
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lucky.</v>

176
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>He made have certain physical factions </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Michael Jordan,</v>

177
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I remember I interviewed him years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

178
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>what makes you the best in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it skill as a town is that ability is</v>

179
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>a backward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a training,</v>

180
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and he was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

181
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:03.704
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you the truth that it won't </v>

182
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>sound like hyperbole or false modesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

183
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even make the high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball team my sophomore year.</v>

184
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I was cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

185
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:13.784
<v Speaker 1>what it is is every day I demand more </v>
<v Speaker 1>from myself than anybody else could </v>

186
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>possibly expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't compete with other people.</v>

187
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I compete with what I'm capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like that kind of standard</v>

188
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>is inspiring.</v>

189
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.450
<v Speaker 2>They see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reminds me a lot.</v>

190
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I had this conversation with Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:27.964
<v Speaker 2>It was like another Americans have great</v>
<v Speaker 2>square jawed superstar and like he was </v>

192
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 2>sort of saying about how he made his </v>
<v Speaker 2>success himself.</v>

193
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

194
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>but you were born with the Tom Cruise </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit like you had that.</v>

195
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Even the will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the will,</v>

196
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you know there's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might as well.</v>

197
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think will come through?</v>

198
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Where did you will come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

199
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think it comes from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be better or </v>

200
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>something you have to push against or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't develop it.</v>

201
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:54.734
<v Speaker 1>How do you build a muscle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't build muscle because you were </v>

202
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 1>born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all born with muscle,</v>

203
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>but events developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You trained it and that means you got to</v>

204
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>find something that you valued more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pain.</v>

205
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>You got to get beyond your pain or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to use your pain and say,</v>

206
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it to become more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what my life's been about and now</v>

207
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer driven by pain is driven </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the joy of seeing people lit up.</v>
