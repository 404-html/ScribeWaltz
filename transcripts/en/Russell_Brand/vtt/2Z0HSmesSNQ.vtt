1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like your online voice style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like through blogging and talking about </v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Scottish independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you're in winter,</v>

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>more international level of notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's talking more about class,</v>

4
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:15.774
<v Speaker 1>but I'm assuming that when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about independent class was a </v>

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>big component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk to me about,</v>

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how I came Kim and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of conflict,</v>

7
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:25.804
<v Speaker 1>the wife sections of the yes movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know like all movements </v>

8
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.384
<v Speaker 1>there's a disagreement in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets about what the priorities are </v>

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>and what posture we should assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally saw.</v>

10
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.284
<v Speaker 1>It was the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and a lot of other people on the </v>

11
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Ken of left and the radical left we we </v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't see,</v>

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.623
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really buy into the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence foster and then we'll talk </v>

13
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>about all this stuff later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought,</v>

14
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.211
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang on way.</v>

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Got All this trouble of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

16
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>If we've not got a really set up an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we're,</v>

17
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>what I do and relation to taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social housing,</v>

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug policy,</v>

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.813
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's really get into the detail </v>

20
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.204
<v Speaker 1>about that stuff because that may be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that mobilizes more people on the </v>

21
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>desk and franchise communities who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>usually apathetic towards politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for good reason.</v>

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.993
<v Speaker 1>So I would be bringing up class usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>on relation to art because I was </v>

24
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>creating music [inaudible] eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the themes that are thought of Mlg,</v>

25
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>no of the independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beer.</v>

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.593
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I would comment a conflict </v>

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.293
<v Speaker 1>when I would go and perform at arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>events that Wa like felt very sort of </v>

28
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.714
<v Speaker 1>student here in middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a certain expectation about </v>

29
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:43.404
<v Speaker 1>what's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice from your expedience of a </v>

30
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>pr as a performer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

31
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.113
<v Speaker 1>because you're more established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no people will tend to come to whatever </v>

32
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you are or an ass shoes.</v>

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.973
<v Speaker 1>But when you're just meeting people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fast team and you're using the </v>

34
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 1>vernacular and a lexicon and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.183
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things that may be perceived as </v>

36
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 1>vulgar on aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Eh,</v>

37
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.553
<v Speaker 1>you just feel resistance and for Mina </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reason then testing questions </v>

38
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>because one of my premed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new tress and,</v>

39
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.773
<v Speaker 1>and dependence was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regionalization of culture and Bratton </v>

40
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>means that a lot of great writers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists from different places under your</v>

41
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.133
<v Speaker 1>care who don't have friends and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>London bubble that just get ignored or </v>

42
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>seniors cain off like firebrands or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get bracketed in a certain way.</v>

43
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And so our thought independence's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it'll viscerally,</v>

44
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I fought independence is a way for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create our own culture and our own,</v>

45
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and configure it out and I'll eat it.</v>

46
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but then there was a lot of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest involved as well and hand say,</v>

48
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.583
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sad of being a bigger fashion or </v>

49
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>smaller point.</v>

50
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been ranting for 15 years.</v>

51
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very competent.</v>

52
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm very passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>but even in Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of wrapping with my own accent,</v>

54
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like a joke for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and that's even worse when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

56
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>so if you're not old or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

57
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.650
<v Speaker 1>the grain rappers and all the MCS doe </v>
<v Speaker 1>neil's are pervading,</v>

58
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.503
<v Speaker 1>protested the of your key hot port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just like all of those </v>

59
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.134
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when Al got any further </v>

60
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.353
<v Speaker 1>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west people who were running these arts </v>

61
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>events and I was wanting to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>or I had class beast disputes where for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them then they were like,</v>

63
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about this later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about this after.</v>

64
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.880
<v Speaker 1>And they would try and play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me in various ways,</v>

65
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>obviously underestimate and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate I was about.</v>

66
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
<v Speaker 1>So that became a sort of a divergence </v>
<v Speaker 1>point for me and a lot of other people </v>

67
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>were for the yes movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That still remains to this day.</v>

68
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I would see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the nature of this dispute?</v>

69
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.254
<v Speaker 1>What is the nature of this disparity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between what I'm picking out you're </v>

70
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.184
<v Speaker 1>describing as a more educated or to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>a classical or conventional word or </v>

71
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.803
<v Speaker 1>the more bourgeois aspect of the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the working class contingencies and </v>

73
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>then also this dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>also a national fooled at the sin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over always will.</v>

75
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

76
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.753
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't characterize it as a dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it does manifest as a </v>

77
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>confrontation and acrimony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would characterize it as,</v>

78
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things getting lost in translation.</v>

79
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>So we currently think about culture as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of continuum where people,</v>

80
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the bottom are waiting to sort of </v>

81
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.614
<v Speaker 1>graduate to become legitimate by virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their willingness to either conceal </v>

82
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.050
<v Speaker 1>or renounce those indicate who they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually are with.</v>

83
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Whereas assay working class culture as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel culture and that there are many</v>

84
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>contradictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x interest at ease lessons.</v>

85
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things that are very distinct.</v>

86
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.041
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.874
<v Speaker 1>I've been socially more bail enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife that I've maxed a lot across a </v>

88
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.344
<v Speaker 1>ravine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So over the years I've built up an </v>

89
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.184
<v Speaker 1>understanding of some of these fault </v>
<v Speaker 1>lanes and that the big donor and </v>

90
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:16.894
<v Speaker 1>communication often can come from simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>a difference in a sense of urgency or </v>

91
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>priority on the watts that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>newsies.</v>

92
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>So what you might see is what you meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>cs passion.</v>

93
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.993
<v Speaker 1>Someone sees it as aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushiness of what you might see as </v>

94
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone thinks his pattern isn't,</v>

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.833
<v Speaker 1>it's the combination of all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little instances where people come away </v>

96
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>from an attempt to mango across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ravine,</v>

97
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.133
<v Speaker 1>that that just becomes natural to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of recall back to where it's </v>

98
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are gritty.</v>

99
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be on the lane,</v>

100
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm more comfortable in the medal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a working class background,</v>

101
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then in my youth there would be</v>

102
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>people trying to police how I spoke that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants the are years,</v>

103
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.313
<v Speaker 1>the things that I was interested then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rigid idea about what a young man </v>

104
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I resented that and challenge that.</v>

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>But then at the same time on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

106
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.213
<v Speaker 1>then even just the things that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about and the way that I wouldn't </v>

107
00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>if fema is changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

108
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>cause I've kind of been caught saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bay,</v>

109
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>a few legitimate people notes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

110
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>oh this we must have Garvey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beforehand it was very,</v>

111
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.024
<v Speaker 1>it was very much a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to kind of manipulate my way into </v>

112
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like stop wearing a hood.</v>

113
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.993
<v Speaker 1>They start wearing a blazer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a pair of glasses instead of a </v>

114
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.594
<v Speaker 1>baseball cap and learn to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like middle class people were alarmed </v>

115
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>that for them that's the sort of form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>

116
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily being clever but sonin </v>
<v Speaker 1>clever on an amount of that.</v>

117
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.444
<v Speaker 1>I sort of picked up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I became more socially </v>

118
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 1>mobile than perhaps my education with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the valid.</v>

119
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.133
<v Speaker 1>Maybe make some good points there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I recently learned </v>

120
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:01.374
<v Speaker 1>about the way that hedge money is </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed is with the imposition of a </v>

121
00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:07.734
<v Speaker 1>narrative and have a language within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way I learned it when I'm doing </v>

122
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:11.994
<v Speaker 1>this course at university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that the way that the western </v>

123
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.923
<v Speaker 1>world or so called secular work deals </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Islam or Middle East and countries </v>

124
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.503
<v Speaker 1>is with the assumption that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a narrative for Islam has to go through </v>

125
00:07:25.141 --> 00:07:29.430
<v Speaker 1>that will conform to what uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post,</v>

126
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I like that,</v>

127
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.563
<v Speaker 1>that create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Christian history has been through </v>

128
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:34.914
<v Speaker 1>lie a prostin ecm and Catholicism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>secularization when as you did when you </v>

129
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>were describing working class culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entity,</v>

130
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a parallel narrative that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a separate Islamic narrative,</v>

131
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.643
<v Speaker 1>there's a separate working class </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and you don't have these </v>

132
00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:49.524
<v Speaker 1>things need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't necessarily conflate and </v>

133
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 1>certainly what you would call I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary or sub narratives.</v>

134
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It can't be subsumed in the infocomm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant narrative.</v>

135
00:07:59.551 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

136
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that mate.</v>

137
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.600
<v Speaker 1>What you said that you have to even on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of lighting,</v>

138
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.513
<v Speaker 1>the way that you accessorize pop on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pair of specs instead of a baseball cap </v>

139
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 1>to be more sort of identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you do that,</v>

140
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you comment in conflict with where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually come from,</v>

141
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>you up pop gagan a blazer and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

142
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:19.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hood there,</v>

143
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.060
<v Speaker 1>who do you hang?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>and saw that actually is not as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>as as that.</v>

145
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.204
<v Speaker 1>That has been difficult at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seem team of kind of like I've tried </v>

146
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>to stay true to what I wore one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really with the book,</v>

147
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.293
<v Speaker 1>what I was trying to do was engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple people from multiple </v>

148
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds at the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell</v>

149
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.743
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
