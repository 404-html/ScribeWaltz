<v Speaker 1>surface of people we admire of the ideas</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now it's time for under the skin.</v>

12
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 2>The nine</v>

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.623
<v Speaker 1>is in all of our social activist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker known for political analysis </v>

14
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>and criticism of corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization.</v>

15
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Her books include no logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shock doctrine,</v>

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and this changes everything which was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times best seller.</v>

17
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:01.634
<v Speaker 1>She frequently appears on global and </v>
<v Speaker 1>national list of top influential </v>

18
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One occasion higher up than me,</v>

19
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>which was infuriating and in 2016 was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ward and probably all occasions.</v>

20
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:10.664
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time I've been on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>list and in 2016 was awarded the Sydney </v>

21
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Peace Prize for activism on climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

22
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:17.294
<v Speaker 1>Her new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be talking about in some </v>

23
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>depth is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not enough at MCO.</v>

24
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Here is this is a look at how we arrived</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this surreal political moment,</v>

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>how to keep it from getting a lot worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how if we keep our heads,</v>

26
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>we can flip the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So primarily in this book,</v>

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>no is not enough.</v>

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.163
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about trump and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump epitomizes and what trump is </v>

29
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a symptom of something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can pray.</v>

30
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>See in this new audio form I can try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.433
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be with you and I should </v>

32
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>have done some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

33
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>What I'd really love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're really beautiful person.</v>

34
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a body Sattva to use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist term,</v>

35
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.494
<v Speaker 1>a person that's helping other people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment perhaps at the expense of </v>

36
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we want to hear?</v>

37
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the price.</v>

38
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I say that there's people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go over if they want it,</v>

39
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.813
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'll stick around here for a </v>

40
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>while trying to help other people over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a good compliment.</v>

41
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.313
<v Speaker 1>I remember with great affection the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous times that we've met the first </v>

42
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.704
<v Speaker 1>time when I was in an erratic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan whirlwind of romance with </v>

43
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>my future wife and having just in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed Donald Trump,</v>

44
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>primarily motivated then by this curious</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse that I had of like,</v>

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>how is this guy so rich when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

46
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>he seems like he's an idiot.</v>

47
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.463
<v Speaker 1>That's why I couldn't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I understood that someone had </v>

48
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>given him his money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the lead,</v>

49
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meeting him,</v>

50
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I kept probing him and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

51
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 1>How have you got this money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

52
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.013
<v Speaker 1>And that was before he was president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know that he was merely a man </v>

53
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:48.704
<v Speaker 1>in the ascent at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems as good a point as any to </v>

54
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.443
<v Speaker 1>launch into your book having </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimented you and my gratitude for </v>

55
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>you coming here and being on our podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the niceties that be observed.</v>

56
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.670
<v Speaker 3>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

57
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 3>so look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

58
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to just put trump in some kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of context.</v>

59
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>This is not looking at the psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

60
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

61
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot out there just about sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of pathologizing him as this extreme,</v>

62
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 3>extreme individually and he's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>an extreme individual,</v>

63
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.880
<v Speaker 3>but he's also just a symptom of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture in so many ways.</v>

64
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 3>He is the fulfillment of so many of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most dangerous trends.</v>

65
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm just the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst of us really.</v>

66
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 3>And there's this way in which he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre.</v>

67
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.033
<v Speaker 3>And so unlike what we're used to from </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians that I think we talk about </v>

68
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 3>him as if he's some sort of Martian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

69
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 3>what did he do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could he really have just tweeted that?</v>

70
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a like this is this,</v>

71
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 3>everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it describes the state they're in as,</v>

72
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 3>as shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see it as really,</v>

73
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 3>it's more like a cliche.</v>

74
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a cliched outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like of course a culture that fetishized</v>

75
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that federal Spanish eyes celebrity that</v>

76
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 3>fetishize is fakeness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It at every level.</v>

77
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you wrote a science fiction novel </v>

78
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.983
<v Speaker 3>about a world in which the United States</v>
<v Speaker 3>elected Donald Trump as their president </v>

79
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 3>and you handed it to your editor editor </v>
<v Speaker 3>would tell you that.</v>

80
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 3>It was too cliched and outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

81
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.961
<v Speaker 3>It's too predictable and outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think trump is the fulfillment.</v>

82
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.723
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was thinking about the theatrical term </v>

83
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.813
<v Speaker 3>grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grotesque is merely an exaggeration of </v>

84
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:31.204
<v Speaker 3>the ordinary to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifiable and recognizable and these </v>

85
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 3>sort of traits were always present under</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bush presidency.</v>

86
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 3>Galumphing individualism was president </v>
<v Speaker 3>and buccaneer international,</v>

87
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 3>like internationalist attitude don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know internationally.</v>

88
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Those interventions about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

89
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.643
<v Speaker 3>the way it's entirely predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that are like a </v>

90
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.433
<v Speaker 3>fingerprint or I suppose it's because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the privilege of a comedic </v>

91
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

92
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Speaker 3>He's sort of something about him that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>likable comparatively.</v>

93
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.903
<v Speaker 3>You know what I feel that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people got odd on sort of </v>

94
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Clintonian Blair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

95
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.443
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least he's new labor and like this </v>

96
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.790
<v Speaker 3>kind of charming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slick,</v>

97
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 3>superficial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technocratic,</v>

98
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 3>bureaucratic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so vinea of pleasantness,</v>

99
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 3>but Marston indifference and ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the needs of the majority of people.</v>

100
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.223
<v Speaker 3>That was disingenuous and untruthful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump may be many things and </v>

101
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 3>clearly as your book outlined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is those things.</v>

102
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 3>But what you also seems to be is </v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic in a bizarre way.</v>

103
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.113
<v Speaker 3>He's not logging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something mad about someone's </v>

104
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 3>lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

105
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 3>he's telling you the truth about being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>liar.</v>

106
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.933
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

107
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 3>so he gets caught lying all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's open about the fact that he's a</v>

108
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 3>liar and he's corrupt and he does </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes to win.</v>

109
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't catch them out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

110
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what people mean when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

111
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least he's honest.</v>

112
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't mean he's technically </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest.</v>

113
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 3>They understand that he lies all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

114
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 3>tick authentically inauthentic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

115
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

116
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but do you think I'm talking to in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

117
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me about economy and energy,</v>

118
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to get too hippy dippy here,</v>

119
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.804
<v Speaker 1>but like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're watching Hillary Clinton </v>

120
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 1>talk on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people.</v>

121
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.463
<v Speaker 1>If people were in the lead up to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>election and then you watched Donald </v>

122
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a,</v>

123
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.073
<v Speaker 1>even in the grotesqueness and evidently </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content was irrelevant because if </v>

124
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>someone gets some of the more outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

125
00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexiest things,</v>

126
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the racist things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if those things are irrelevant,</v>

127
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easier.</v>

128
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.880
<v Speaker 1>That's getting traction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What easier that's reaching people.</v>

129
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my idea is that it's authenticity.</v>

130
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck it,</v>

131
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of think,</v>

132
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.673
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is not Hillary Clinton where </v>

133
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.783
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't seem to know how to </v>

134
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.404
<v Speaker 1>talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you see them and like tim resume </v>

135
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.213
<v Speaker 1>talking off the Greenfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think this person is almost not a </v>

136
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

137
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.023
<v Speaker 1>They don't know Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what we're going to do </v>

138
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.431
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Donald Trump,</v>

139
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

140
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I was eating chocolate cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You something.</v>

141
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.233
<v Speaker 1>This is bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about it that's </v>

142
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>not what I've been used to for the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>24 years.</v>

143
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.353
<v Speaker 1>And I can see how people are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised and disillusioned might </v>

144
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.234
<v Speaker 1>find it appealing.</v>

145
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also something,</v>

146
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton,</v>

147
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Blair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

148
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these figures are,</v>

149
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.813
<v Speaker 3>they are the symbol of the Davos class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people up on the mountain top </v>

150
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 3>at those already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

151
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 3>it's the party that not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

152
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.193
<v Speaker 3>you were invited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people were not invited to </v>

153
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:20.924
<v Speaker 3>write that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

154
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 3>it's the party of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of the winners in this,</v>

155
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 3>in this global economy have a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>group of super winters and,</v>

156
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.723
<v Speaker 3>and huge numbers of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of locked out people at the bottom of </v>

157
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:35.264
<v Speaker 3>that mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think the data summit became </v>

158
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 3>this sort of symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why this phrase devost class</v>

159
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 3>came a little bit into currency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

160
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 3>It's this world where you had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians hobnobbing with the ceos,</v>

161
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 3>the billionaires and then a list </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities blessing the whole thing.</v>

162
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>

163
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 3>it was a world that most people had </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no access to.</v>

164
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.443
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's something about </v>

165
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:05.051
<v Speaker 3>trump and the way there was a strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of generosity to his wealth in that</v>

166
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 3>he did invite the world in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

167
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.423
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

168
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 3>most wealthy people in the world right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

169
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>the super rich don't want to flaunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>their wealth.</v>

170
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.953
<v Speaker 3>Like they understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Bill Gates doesn't want us to see </v>

171
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.904
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his many mansions and he doesn't know </v>

172
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 3>gun curing malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants us to see his altruism,</v>

173
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas trump said to the world,</v>

174
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come into my mansion,</v>

175
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to turn it into a reality TV </v>

176
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people were invited into his wealth</v>

177
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 3>and there's a way in which I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

178
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was gratitude for that.</v>

179
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

180
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that that is something of </v>

181
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:47.024
<v Speaker 3>what people mean by authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Authenticity is such a strange word to </v>

182
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 3>use to describe this sort of festival of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fakeness that is the trump family.</v>

183
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

184
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.811
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

185
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.644
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think it is a message that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have sold if the alternative was </v>

186
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.844
<v Speaker 3>not Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if Bernie had been running </v>

187
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 3>against trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the absurdity of this,</v>

188
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this family that shows in their first </v>

189
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:18.550
<v Speaker 3>televised interview to address Americans</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a series of golden thrones,</v>

190
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that interview that they did.</v>

191
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 3>So he loves the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a</v>

192
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.091
<v Speaker 1>sofa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

193
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>like an emperor or assaulting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

194
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golden in our country,</v>

195
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.623
<v Speaker 1>the image of him with Nigel farage and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden elevate something that became a </v>

196
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>kind of an emblem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the but the brazenness seems like an</v>

197
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:41.094
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How devoid and bereft of hope must we </v>

198
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How disillusioned and despairing must we</v>

199
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:48.344
<v Speaker 1>have been that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insignificant numbers of women and </v>

200
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:52.194
<v Speaker 1>people from demographics that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine it would feel particularly </v>

201
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>offended are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

202
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

203
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>we prefer that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We prefer that.</v>

204
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important lesson for the left in </v>

205
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see the left learning.</v>

206
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends how you define the left,</v>

207
00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:08.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is,</v>

208
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:13.121
<v Speaker 3>I think fairness and sharing kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there has been a learning.</v>

209
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

210
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.513
<v Speaker 3>When I look at the Corbyn campaign here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and which I think in some ways is a </v>

211
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:23.630
<v Speaker 3>reaction to trumpism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

212
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this completely unfocused,</v>

213
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Speaker 3>grouped unselect the Anti brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

214
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.113
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Corbyn is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the person who actually started </v>

215
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.943
<v Speaker 3>applying the principles of marketing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>political parties in a serious way was </v>

216
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Tony Blair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he.</v>

217
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I remember when I was </v>

218
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:46.934
<v Speaker 3>writing no logo 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was shocking that there was this </v>

219
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 3>politician who used the word branding to</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe a political party.</v>

220
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean the new labour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new labour and,</v>

221
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were rebranding the Labour party,</v>

222
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:04.310
<v Speaker 3>giving it a new name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A new logo was like new coke.</v>

223
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

224
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:05.803
<v Speaker 3>And what I wrote no logo is that Tony </v>
<v Speaker 3>Blair's Labour party was like a labor </v>

225
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:11.500
<v Speaker 3>scented party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

226
00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:12.334
<v Speaker 3>and this was shocking in the 19 nineties</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would sort of apply the </v>

227
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:15.344
<v Speaker 3>techniques used to sell dishwashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>liquid liquid and Coca Cola to a </v>

228
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 3>political party that he was divorcing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this word labor,</v>

229
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:26.810
<v Speaker 3>which traditionally meant working people</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

230
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 3>from it was [inaudible] it and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning it into a brand,</v>

231
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.323
<v Speaker 3>pulling it up from its roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I found really moving about </v>

232
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 3>about Corbin's campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching it,</v>

233
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

234
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.440
<v Speaker 3>because I wasn't here and particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ken loach a little films right?</v>

235
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Was that he put workers for the workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started in his campaign,</v>

236
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.183
<v Speaker 3>just regular working people and indeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>public sector workers who have been so </v>

237
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 3>steadily vilified over the past 40 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>were the stars of his campaign,</v>

238
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 3>not him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.683
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd hear be hearing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>nurses and pediatricians breaking down </v>

240
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.334
<v Speaker 3>crying and teachers just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real impacts of austerity and then </v>

241
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you just see the logo labor and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant labor,</v>

242
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just meant workers.</v>

243
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>It just meant it meant what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally meant.</v>

244
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 3>And so it sort of felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

245
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I think people are learning the lessons </v>
<v Speaker 3>of trump.</v>

246
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 3>They might not be learning it in the US </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

247
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.980
<v Speaker 3>but I think I feel like here there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction against this,</v>

248
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.023
<v Speaker 3>this fakery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in the states you have liberals </v>

249
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 3>who think that the solution to trump is </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting oprah to run against him.</v>

250
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously or Mark Zuckerberg get get,</v>

251
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 3>get a liberal billionare to run against </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump and all will be.</v>

252
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the broader context like,</v>

253
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>isn't it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

254
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't Yanis Varoufakis Yanis </v>
<v Speaker 3>Varoufakis coming in when he was,</v>

255
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.433
<v Speaker 3>he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Wolfgang Schauble said the </v>

256
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.560
<v Speaker 3>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

257
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 3>As long as you don't change anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

258
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 3>When you started out saying about Blair </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mentality of branding,</v>

259
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.363
<v Speaker 3>he was doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it was extremely small in </v>

260
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:12.844
<v Speaker 3>retrospect.</v>

261
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.903
<v Speaker 3>History is totally disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a lovely North American </v>

262
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 3>reaction to some British coffee I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to say.</v>

263
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

264
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 3>But that's a reaction now I winching and</v>
<v Speaker 3>recalling in.</v>

265
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:26.771
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

266
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 3>I just had to do that bitter espresso.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

267
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:31.714
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt I needed to super caffeinate </v>

268
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 3>myself to your mouth with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reach through your ears.</v>

269
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I shuttered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a shoulder.</v>

270
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Can I shops a funny story about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

271
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you can tell,</v>

272
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm North American and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

273
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I did live in this country for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one year,</v>

274
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.163
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 10 years old and had an </v>

275
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.920
<v Speaker 3>absolutely terrible time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

276
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

277
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to,</v>

278
00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.343
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lived in Oxford and I went to a </v>

279
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 3>school that I don't think exists anymore</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Bishop Kirk.</v>

280
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.990
<v Speaker 3>We had that burned down because of you.</v>

281
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.473
<v Speaker 3>But see what North American kids do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bond is like the easiest way that you </v>

282
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 3>can make friends as a kid in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America is to trash the food,</v>

283
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the school cafeteria or,</v>

284
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 3>or it's summer camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

285
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how,</v>

286
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.570
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the ways you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bond.</v>

287
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:24.890
<v Speaker 3>And so my first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

288
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

289
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 3>we went to the cafeteria and they gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>us some terrible food and they,</v>

290
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the pictures of custard,</v>

291
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:33.934
<v Speaker 3>which was a new phenomenon to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pewter pitchers of custard and I sat </v>

292
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 3>down at the table of my new would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends at age at,</v>

293
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I think I was nine at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not yet 10.</v>

294
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is disgusting.</v>

295
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 3>A little girl named Katie Bennett,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the vicar's daughter,</v>

296
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>looked up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's lovely.</v>

297
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.943
<v Speaker 1>That's when I realized I wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no British friends even when you had </v>

298
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 1>been raised by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely,</v>

299
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:01.454
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you criticized our pitchers of </v>

300
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>custard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our listeners,</v>

301
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>we're off to voting booths and ticking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the box.</v>

302
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Mark the UKIP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lovely.</v>

303
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.873
<v Speaker 1>Lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have a sip of this coffee again </v>

304
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 1>and then say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicer reaction.</v>

305
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.093
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lovely well done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a little bit of a swallow </v>

306
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.650
<v Speaker 1>that looked like you were disgusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naomi Klein,</v>

307
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.770
<v Speaker 1>so you were there very much like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little boy,</v>

308
00:15:26.771 --> 00:15:27.604
<v Speaker 1>the emperor's new clothes you wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little girl that pointed out that </v>

309
00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the custard was actually disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember reading in,</v>

310
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.013
<v Speaker 1>I read no logo when it was the coolest </v>
<v Speaker 1>book to read at the time and I was a </v>

311
00:15:38.141 --> 00:15:38.974
<v Speaker 1>heroin addict at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of the more dense passages were </v>

312
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:44.920
<v Speaker 1>tricky and I was already in Cuba while </v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

313
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure I've told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chewing gum commercial,</v>

314
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.220
<v Speaker 1>so it was felt somewhat conflicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a really no logo which had been</v>

315
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:52.510
<v Speaker 1>reading before I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading it.</v>

316
00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I was making a chewing gum commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most vacuous of all products,</v>

317
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:56.284
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary mimicking of mastication </v>

318
00:15:58.301 --> 00:15:59.134
<v Speaker 1>while the world staffs and I was in Cuba</v>
<v Speaker 1>where unlike a sort of where there was </v>

319
00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:06.640
<v Speaker 1>the experiment of socialism was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>withering before the eyes,</v>

320
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:07.474
<v Speaker 1>but still something very beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible and you I suppose in that </v>

321
00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:13.600
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>No logo,</v>

322
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.910
<v Speaker 1>bringing capitalism to Cuba personally.</v>

323
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I've personally doing my level best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like an agent in a sense to try to</v>

324
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:21.250
<v Speaker 1>try to get naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on guys,</v>

325
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:22.120
<v Speaker 1>give it a go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>

326
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.420
<v Speaker 1>They in my fraternity in solidarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that mural down.</v>

327
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to delicious coke my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shop.</v>

328
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this Bacardi.</v>

329
00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You'll love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an insult.</v>

330
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Now tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

331
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.973
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you talk there about Tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blair coopting the language of branding </v>

332
00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and consumerism going and applying it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political sphere.</v>

333
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.233
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it almost like that the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere is an enclave within the uber </v>

334
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:50.404
<v Speaker 1>context of consumerism and capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of course that language is going to </v>

335
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:54.244
<v Speaker 1>have a greater efficacy than a sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular topical political language </v>

336
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and ideology because we're not living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political culture.</v>

337
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 1>We are living in a consumer culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that language,</v>

338
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 1>those images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind,</v>

339
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.520
<v Speaker 1>that kind of discourse is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more effective because we don't,</v>

340
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.920
<v Speaker 1>we all agree now the other than sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

341
00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:15.754
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the last election in this </v>

342
00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:18.760
<v Speaker 1>country is cause for optimism in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you sort of think,</v>

343
00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:19.594
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who vote in our kind of kindness </v>

344
00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:23.440
<v Speaker 1>and people have had enough and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sick of the old models,</v>

345
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:24.274
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately things are continuing in the </v>

346
00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 1>same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

347
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Because what we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a consumer culture as opposed</v>

348
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:32.734
<v Speaker 1>to a democratic culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder if it isn't cyclical like </v>

349
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Wah Wah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we've just maxed out on.</v>

350
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is way I hope.</v>

351
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I hope that Donald Trump is as far as</v>

352
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take this extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment of,</v>

353
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.633
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of selling absolutely everything in </v>

354
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a corporatizing,</v>

355
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 3>every bit of the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every bit of public space and yes,</v>

356
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.733
<v Speaker 3>then applying the treating politics as </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is a corporation and applying the </v>

357
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 3>rules of marketing and branding to </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics is a natural extension of that.</v>

358
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.103
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's changing and I think there </v>

359
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:18.864
<v Speaker 3>is room for a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another kind of another kind of </v>

360
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:22.764
<v Speaker 3>political project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always felt when I was writing no </v>

361
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.764
<v Speaker 3>logo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was something inherently </v>

362
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:27.774
<v Speaker 3>hopeful in the fact that companies like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nike and starbucks and apple were using </v>

363
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.790
<v Speaker 3>ideas like revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>community transcendence to sell consumer</v>

364
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 3>products that could never deliver these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

365
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

366
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:45.983
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that this started to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the height of the neoliberal period </v>

367
00:18:50.211 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

368
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.713
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>

369
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 3>at the fulfillment of the Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher Project,</v>

370
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is when it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

371
00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.920
<v Speaker 3>the model was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:18:59.921 --> 00:19:00.754
<v Speaker 3>you make a product a and as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation you are in the business of </v>

373
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:07.110
<v Speaker 3>making products and selling those </v>
<v Speaker 3>products.</v>

374
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.943
<v Speaker 3>And you would then slap a logo on it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate it from other products in </v>

375
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 3>the marketplace and buy advertisements </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tell people about it.</v>

376
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:17.670
<v Speaker 3>But what changed in the nineties is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>these companies,</v>

377
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:21.670
<v Speaker 3>and this is what no logo is about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what the meaning of this flip of,</v>

378
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 3>of companies like Nike emerging and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

379
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:25.411
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

380
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:28.090
<v Speaker 3>we're not a shoe company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not a what,</v>

381
00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not a trainer company.</v>

382
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 3>We are about the idea of transcendence </v>
<v Speaker 3>through sports,</v>

383
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.654
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are about the idea of you being your </v>

384
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:36.590
<v Speaker 3>best of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

385
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

386
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 3>of any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

387
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being your best.</v>

388
00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

389
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.733
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starbucks announced that the meaning of </v>

390
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:48.510
<v Speaker 3>their brand was the third place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not home,</v>

391
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 3>not work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but community,</v>

392
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:51.180
<v Speaker 3>a place where we gather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

393
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.973
<v Speaker 3>And this was the period where apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>started using the iconography of every </v>

394
00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary movement and Gandhi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin Luther King.</v>

395
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.553
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

396
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 3>as an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just said,</v>

397
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 3>think different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

398
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 3>And these huge billboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

399
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand you can wring your hands</v>

400
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:08.251
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

401
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 3>they're coopting all of our ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

402
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:11.004
<v Speaker 3>But I always found it quite hopeful </v>
<v Speaker 3>because with all the best market </v>

403
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:14.814
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were finding was that we </v>

404
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 3>wanted more than just trainers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>laptops and,</v>

405
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.043
<v Speaker 3>and lattes and for capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a great recipe because it keeps </v>

406
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 3>you shopping because as soon as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

407
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you unwrap this new thing </v>

408
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>that was supposed to bring you community</v>
<v Speaker 3>and revolution,</v>

409
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you're immediately dissatisfied and have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shop some more.</v>

410
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.810
<v Speaker 3>So that's great for an economic system </v>
<v Speaker 3>built on growth.</v>

411
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.213
<v Speaker 3>But it does mean that that part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves that longs to be part of </v>

412
00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:42.204
<v Speaker 3>something bigger than just our atomized </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence and shopping is parental </v>

413
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 3>perennially unfulfilled.</v>

414
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 3>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

415
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 3>for me as a political animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought,</v>

416
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should thank them.</v>

417
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 3>They've done our market research for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

418
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.050
<v Speaker 3>and so it is the role of social </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements to rebuild a,</v>

419
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

420
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for people to actually get</v>
<v Speaker 3>real community,</v>

421
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:08.314
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not a coincidence that </v>

422
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 3>these companies started selling these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

423
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 3>At the very moment when every public </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution,</v>

424
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

425
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 3>every place where we used to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of belonging,</v>

426
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 3>whether it was organized religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>whether it was the public square,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this is being eroded.</v>

428
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 3>So now we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

429
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 3>we're getting it in a temporary state </v>
<v Speaker 3>through shopping.</v>

430
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

431
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.464
<v Speaker 3>I think we are at a moment where we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to see signs that we're </v>

432
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 3>actually getting it from rebuilding our </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of community and belonging.</v>

433
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the accompanying component,</v>

434
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 1>all of the advent of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some grotesque,</v>

435
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:49.563
<v Speaker 1>a Uber instantiation of which we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently uber the car that really now </v>

436
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

437
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have now the,</v>

438
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.283
<v Speaker 1>those synonyms have dovetailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this sort of Uber version we labor </v>

439
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 1>beneath the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

440
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

441
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.830
<v Speaker 1>the accompanying idea of socialism has </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>

442
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd been discredited because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you can,</v>

443
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.800
<v Speaker 1>when you look at sort of perhaps British</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

445
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.733
<v Speaker 1>which is the famous people famously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's as much to methodism as marks </v>

446
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 1>one recognizes that there's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

447
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.330
<v Speaker 1>There is not just one epistemology for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of fairness and kindness.</v>

448
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>There is not just one lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one room,</v>

449
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.210
<v Speaker 1>but what I feel is that battle has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>won and I retro spective,</v>

450
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 1>resurrection of those old ideas will not</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fulfilling,</v>

451
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but precisely the phenomena that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak of when you say,</v>

452
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.433
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this perennial yearning for </v>

453
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 1>belonging now that can be co opted by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism can be co opted by,</v>

454
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:02.380
<v Speaker 1>consumerism that you can attach the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

455
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I want this new phone to the I am an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

456
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I am free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

457
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:07.803
<v Speaker 1>What is the indigenous feeling and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>can the indigenous feeling be properly </v>

458
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:11.344
<v Speaker 1>utilized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think by mechanistic or </v>

459
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>materialistic idea when we are dealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with metaphysics,</v>

460
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>when we're dealing in fact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human spirit,</v>

461
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>when we're dealing with something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when spoken of in secular terms,</v>

462
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that is a my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniably a spiritual idea,</v>

463
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a scientific idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the reality of interconnection,</v>

464
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.830
<v Speaker 3>the reality that we are not atomized </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

465
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.683
<v Speaker 3>that we are exist within webs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection with other human beings and </v>

466
00:23:39.741 --> 00:23:40.574
<v Speaker 3>with the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We exist in relationships of dependence </v>

467
00:23:43.101 --> 00:23:44.960
<v Speaker 3>and interdependence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you mean by that?</v>

468
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean by that knowing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't exist without clean water,</v>

469
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:50.084
<v Speaker 3>we can't exist without healthy soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't exist without an atmosphere </v>

470
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 3>that creates a bubble that is safe for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

471
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:01.040
<v Speaker 3>for humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it's a very fragile state.</v>

472
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can tell ourselves a narrative,</v>

473
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 3>and we talked about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

474
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean the narrative that we have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling ourselves since the dawn of the </v>

475
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:11.204
<v Speaker 3>scientific revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a narrative of dominance and </v>

476
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.204
<v Speaker 3>apartness from nature that's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the span of human history began with </v>

477
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 3>agriculture or industry.</v>

478
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Did you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

479
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I said scientific revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

480
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an interplay between three </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

481
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:28.754
<v Speaker 3>One is Judeo Christianity and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the scientific revolution and all </v>

482
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 3>kinds of new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

483
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.913
<v Speaker 3>ideas that put humans on a sort of ego </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip and imagining that all would be </v>

484
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:44.324
<v Speaker 3>known one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then key technologies that actually </v>

485
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:49.034
<v Speaker 3>seemed to make the dream of domination </v>
<v Speaker 3>real and the key technology and all of </v>

486
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:53.624
<v Speaker 3>that was the steam engine where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell yourself a story about who you're </v>

487
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 3>going to dominate nature all you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But until the steam engine,</v>

488
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a fantasy because you can only </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell your ships when the wind blows.</v>

489
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 3>You are in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dialogue with the natural world.</v>

490
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 3>You need wind in order to sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell yourself a story,</v>

491
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

492
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.990
<v Speaker 3>of dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

493
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.640
<v Speaker 3>about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

494
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:18.400
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

495
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 3>your factory.</v>

496
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 3>But the fact is before the steam engine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you needed rushing water.</v>

497
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>You need a water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a water wheel that,</v>

498
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.543
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that needed the water at a certain </v>

499
00:25:26.571 --> 00:25:27.291
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

500
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So there was a negotiation with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural world.</v>

501
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think the power of the steam </v>
<v Speaker 3>engine,</v>

502
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.563
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this idea that now you really are </v>

503
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:37.094
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings really are God in that you </v>

504
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 3>can sell your ships whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are the boss of nature.</v>

505
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And this is the way the steam engine </v>
<v Speaker 3>would market it.</v>

506
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 3>And so I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you had,</v>

507
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:48.563
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll now I'll pull to try and know </v>

508
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>about kind of thing about power and </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomy that you,</v>

509
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.313
<v Speaker 3>you are now the boss of the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and also more of a boss of your </v>

510
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:01.540
<v Speaker 3>workers because when your factories are </v>
<v Speaker 3>immobile,</v>

511
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 3>we mean you can build them wherever </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have portable energy,</v>

512
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't build it where,</v>

513
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.903
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the water is and then you're kind </v>

514
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 3>of captive to your workers.</v>

515
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

516
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you can be more abusive boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go where,</v>

517
00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:16.270
<v Speaker 3>where there's a surplus of labor and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

518
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.300
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what I'm talking about comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from some terrific research by a Swedish</v>

519
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:23.650
<v Speaker 3>historian named Andreas mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

520
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.553
<v Speaker 3>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a gradual process where </v>

521
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you had the ideas but the ideas weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>real until you had the technology.</v>

522
00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 3>But now we're in this era where it turns</v>
<v Speaker 3>out we were never the boss.</v>

523
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I believe climate change is </v>

524
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 3>a spiritual crisis and a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis as well as an ecological crisis.</v>

525
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Because what the natural world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling us,</v>

526
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when asphalt</v>

527
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 3>is melting and Cambridge in Arizona this</v>
<v Speaker 3>summer,</v>

528
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.223
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when Goldman Sachs is buffeted by </v>

529
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Super Storm Sandy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

530
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.670
<v Speaker 3>you are not the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every action has a reaction.</v>

531
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 3>You are still in dialogue with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural world.</v>

532
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Timeframe is altered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

533
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:02.720
<v Speaker 3>So it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

534
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.593
<v Speaker 3>there was about 200 years where we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell ourselves this narrative of </v>

535
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 3>apartness and separate NASPA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is why I say it's,</v>

536
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a spiritual story.</v>

537
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:12.984
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason why civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood this for so long is because </v>

538
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:20.400
<v Speaker 3>they were living at relationships of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interdependence with nature.</v>

539
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

540
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.823
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that folk mythology and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a early pre monotheistic </v>

541
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:27.194
<v Speaker 1>religion contained within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ideas that we are rediscovering and </v>

542
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:33.080
<v Speaker 1>indeed rebranding as scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries.</v>

543
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.450
<v Speaker 1>They were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were already present.</v>

544
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.060
<v Speaker 1>People talk of mindfulness now is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

545
00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that mindfulness does </v>
<v Speaker 1>really help high heart disease,</v>

546
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.563
<v Speaker 1>but if you can just extract it from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Mumbo jumbo about one living </v>

547
00:27:44.781 --> 00:27:45.614
<v Speaker 1>consciousness manifesting itself on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material plane or in a rather more </v>

548
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.343
<v Speaker 1>potent and shorter three letter words </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that is very difficult to </v>

549
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.703
<v Speaker 1>introduce a narrative that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersede the narrative that you </v>

550
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.253
<v Speaker 1>articulated in no logo and subsequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>described the mutations in much of your </v>

551
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.800
<v Speaker 1>later work without a story that has I </v>
<v Speaker 1>more vital visceral,</v>

552
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.840
<v Speaker 1>deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient,</v>

553
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.900
<v Speaker 1>potent human truth about one Sun God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of consciousness and the true</v>

554
00:28:24.321 --> 00:28:25.154
<v Speaker 1>nature of interconnectivity and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the response to sort of the this </v>

555
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.030
<v Speaker 1>was that knows anything.</v>

556
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:36.050
<v Speaker 1>The deer of capitalism has got to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly potent and motivating idea and</v>

557
00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:37.274
<v Speaker 1>your point that the fact that apple and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike have to refer to in order to </v>

558
00:28:41.211 --> 00:28:46.211
<v Speaker 1>motivate people to buy unnecessary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases brilliant trainers is is a</v>

559
00:28:46.701 --> 00:28:47.534
<v Speaker 1>reference to oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's community profits with a Ph in </v>

560
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that for me is will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to go back to that source.</v>

561
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:56.990
<v Speaker 1>The answer is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:57.824
<v Speaker 1>like for me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know next to nothing about </v>

563
00:28:58.881 --> 00:28:59.714
<v Speaker 1>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the thing that sort of comes </v>

564
00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:02.150
<v Speaker 1>up a lot in this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's good to,</v>

565
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when mark talks about alienation,</v>

566
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.353
<v Speaker 1>when he's talking about the spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of a mechanized and fully </v>

567
00:29:08.631 --> 00:29:13.631
<v Speaker 1>industrialized culture that is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by its labor force,</v>

568
00:29:13.761 --> 00:29:17.540
<v Speaker 1>that it's just that in itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of the spirit and the,</v>

569
00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:20.660
<v Speaker 1>my personal frustration around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents of,</v>

570
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the,</v>

571
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.623
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lighter side of the neoliberal </v>

572
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.033
<v Speaker 1>project is unwilling to not backtrack </v>
<v Speaker 1>but to embrace the spiritual side of </v>

573
00:29:31.851 --> 00:29:34.960
<v Speaker 1>this because the new age stuff sounds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a bit sort of God,</v>

574
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.440
<v Speaker 1>not back crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

575
00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:37.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to recognize that there is room in </v>

576
00:29:39.471 --> 00:29:41.230
<v Speaker 1>this discourse for what is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

577
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 1>that we're fighting for?</v>

578
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did it matter that we're human </v>

579
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:45.364
<v Speaker 1>beings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it matter that human beings in </v>

580
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 1>the planet is in trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

581
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.060
<v Speaker 1>How do we avert avoid nihilism unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's with some deeper spiritual truth?</v>

582
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

583
00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:01.134
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit of a difference in </v>

584
00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:05.904
<v Speaker 3>North America than here because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>role of indigenous leadership in </v>

585
00:30:13.741 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 3>progressive movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the climate movement and</v>

586
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:19.860
<v Speaker 3>in the environmental movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

587
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.920
<v Speaker 3>every single major battleground against </v>
<v Speaker 3>a new mine,</v>

588
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.913
<v Speaker 3>against a nuclear waste dump against a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new pipeline is a fight that has </v>

589
00:30:30.811 --> 00:30:33.020
<v Speaker 3>indigenous people at the forefront.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

590
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.990
<v Speaker 3>whether this is true in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Canada where I live,</v>

591
00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:38.660
<v Speaker 3>it's true in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

592
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it's true in Australia and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

593
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in most parts of the world,</v>

594
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true in India.</v>

595
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.210
<v Speaker 3>That's true all over Latin America and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.183
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what's been interesting to me as </v>

597
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.100
<v Speaker 3>somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:30:56.101 --> 00:30:56.934
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come more from the economic side of </v>

599
00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:00.780
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tino,</v>

600
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 3>my early writing was all focused on </v>
<v Speaker 3>labor and human rights,</v>

601
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.080
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less so the environment.</v>

602
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:12.770
<v Speaker 3>But for the past decade or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been very immersed in,</v>

603
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.843
<v Speaker 3>in the climate movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is deeply interconnected </v>

604
00:31:16.621 --> 00:31:17.454
<v Speaker 3>with all of those other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I find it really exciting to watch </v>

605
00:31:21.691 --> 00:31:26.691
<v Speaker 3>the ways in which settler movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>movements of,</v>

606
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.943
<v Speaker 3>of nonindigenous people are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>impacted by exposure to an indigenous </v>

607
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:38.390
<v Speaker 3>worldview that has the oneness that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're describing at its center,</v>

608
00:31:40.021 --> 00:31:41.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

609
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're fighting a pipeline at </v>

610
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:47.520
<v Speaker 3>standing rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are fighting that pipeline according</v>

611
00:31:47.521 --> 00:31:50.610
<v Speaker 3>to the rules of the community there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have the rules up,</v>

612
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.693
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

613
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.750
<v Speaker 3>on the side of the various structures in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camp that say you are in ceremony.</v>

614
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.520
<v Speaker 3>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are not protested.</v>

615
00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:01.620
<v Speaker 3>We are protectors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're water protectors,</v>

616
00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:06.180
<v Speaker 3>meaning we are protecting living systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that protect all of life.</v>

617
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.103
<v Speaker 3>And when we march up to the police sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an act of ceremony that is not </v>

618
00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:13.500
<v Speaker 3>an act of protest.</v>

619
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

620
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.620
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

621
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it creates,</v>

622
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the interesting conversations I </v>

623
00:32:18.871 --> 00:32:21.960
<v Speaker 3>had at standing rock and every chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this in the book,</v>

624
00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't describe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

625
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.670
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

626
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:31.790
<v Speaker 3>a guy of a poet who I ran into there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd been in many different left spaces,</v>

627
00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:34.674
<v Speaker 3>protest spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just talking about how </v>

628
00:32:36.091 --> 00:32:36.924
<v Speaker 3>different this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of things he said was really </v>

629
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:40.724
<v Speaker 3>different was that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every movement that I've been a part of </v>

630
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:43.784
<v Speaker 3>has fetishized use and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of just sort of perennially </v>

631
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 3>starting over and just kind of hating </v>
<v Speaker 3>old people.</v>

632
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this is a culture that respects </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom,</v>

633
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 3>hard won wisdom of elders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to say all older people are right,</v>

634
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.663
<v Speaker 3>but that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a deeply intergenerational </v>

635
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 3>movement that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that young people were at the forefront,</v>

636
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:08.610
<v Speaker 3>but elders were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

637
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 3>were teachers and leaders as well.</v>

638
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just one of the ways that I </v>

639
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 3>think the culture of the left is slowly </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>

640
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you just said.</v>

641
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a hood that before I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware that the,</v>

642
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:23.763
<v Speaker 3>a pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ceremony ceremony instead of protest </v>

643
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 3>and immediately you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

644
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.350
<v Speaker 3>instead of protests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protests,</v>

645
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 3>that's really good because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>denying the conventional lexicon,</v>

646
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:37.724
<v Speaker 3>which is what frames is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll just protesting against this </v>

647
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:41.234
<v Speaker 3>natural progressive thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be happening rather than </v>

648
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>we'll protecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

649
00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:45.164
<v Speaker 3>you're coming from a place of love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're coming from a place of love for </v>

650
00:33:49.581 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 3>this land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for these living systems that no one can</v>

651
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:56.030
<v Speaker 3>do without.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

652
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.890
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

653
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 3>in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be against something.</v>

654
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:01.664
<v Speaker 3>You have to be against this pipeline </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is threatening the only source of </v>

655
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:05.780
<v Speaker 3>drinking water for this community.</v>

656
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 3>But it's not driven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

657
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:08.624
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a sort of a constant reminder that </v>

658
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:12.950
<v Speaker 3>it isn't hate that is dry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

659
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 3>hatred of these oil companies are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although,</v>

660
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.860
<v Speaker 3>although there's anger there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

661
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:20.780
<v Speaker 3>and there was opposition there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

662
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.590
<v Speaker 3>but the but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's serving this broader love.</v>

663
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

664
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.890
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

665
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.720
<v Speaker 3>people ask me stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>

666
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 3>how do you stay hopeful and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the movement.</v>

667
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:31.814
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason why that question</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up so much is because so many </v>

668
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:38.420
<v Speaker 3>people who are in spaces of opposition </v>
<v Speaker 3>or kind of pickled in anti,</v>

669
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

670
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.930
<v Speaker 3>in that space for understandable </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

671
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in these,</v>

672
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.833
<v Speaker 3>her frontline environmental battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really are so often about </v>

673
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:55.150
<v Speaker 3>communities falling more deeply in love </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the place,</v>

674
00:34:55.251 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

675
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's their coast,</v>

676
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.401
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 3>understanding how dependent they are on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the streams and,</v>

678
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and oceans that surround them.</v>

679
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.103
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and learning about the interdependence </v>

680
00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:09.914
<v Speaker 3>that was always there before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but which we were ignored in our little </v>

681
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:13.124
<v Speaker 3>bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the contingent of the culture that </v>

682
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:21.191
<v Speaker 3>has become prevalent that we live in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>from dislocation is a dominant idea that</v>

683
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:24.590
<v Speaker 3>you have no integral relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your land.</v>

684
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.310
<v Speaker 3>You don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is distinct and superior to environment.</v>

685
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 3>It is a resource for us to be used for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to use,</v>

686
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the challenge of,</v>

687
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if these ideas are stitched into ancient</v>

688
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.203
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is there in there that we are </v>

689
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.293
<v Speaker 1>the gate in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else in there are we neglecting </v>

690
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 1>wherever it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

691
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:46.314
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness is good for your heart or we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are one with our environment or the </v>

692
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:51.550
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

693
00:35:51.551 --> 00:35:52.384
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

694
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 1>gay in marginalizing and humiliation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shaman by the settler cultures.</v>

695
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 1>When hunter gatherer of packs were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrangled,</v>

696
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.213
<v Speaker 1>coiled and dis empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that cultures could be grounded so </v>

697
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 1>that the earth could be subjugated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to live between realms,</v>

698
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.380
<v Speaker 1>to imagine new societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ways of being like even by rejecting</v>

699
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:18.010
<v Speaker 1>the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drumming up,</v>

700
00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.570
<v Speaker 3>drumming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing,</v>

701
00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:23.840
<v Speaker 3>these were all banned for indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous drumming.</v>

702
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Got Rid of all</v>

703
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.790
<v Speaker 1>their ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their music,</v>

704
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 1>which yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the culture.</v>

705
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's happened again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who did we do it to?</v>

706
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 1>The British bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically everyone that we,</v>

707
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.370
<v Speaker 1>the ones doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually Irish dumped by my.</v>

708
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got.</v>

709
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.173
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about those lovely trains we give </v>

710
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:39.730
<v Speaker 1>to the people of India?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They loved those trains come on.</v>

711
00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about culture?</v>

712
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Try and look at the tray about fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newt.</v>

713
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're everywhere they'll be on the </v>

714
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:47.484
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop Moaning.</v>

715
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

716
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is important.</v>

717
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.253
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I don't know quite how to make </v>

718
00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:57.204
<v Speaker 1>such a potent idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palatable to secularized people without </v>

719
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:05.901
<v Speaker 1>making it sound a bit crap and Hesi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do what you're trying.</v>

720
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I really am trying to bring some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glory of God back into this,</v>

721
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:13.680
<v Speaker 1>a bit of fuel area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of righteousness,</v>

722
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 1>a bit of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of archangel energy,</v>

723
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 1>some flaming swords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

724
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nondenominational,</v>

725
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

726
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean I feel like every culture in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world should find what connects them to </v>

727
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connects them to the one that's connects</v>

728
00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:24.944
<v Speaker 1>them to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I feel like I have to make it </v>

729
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:29.750
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic and political for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell not that.</v>

730
00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:30.584
<v Speaker 1>How is any sort of centralized system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any post Westphalian clap trap about </v>

731
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:38.150
<v Speaker 1>nations ever going to work when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be tied up in a Daf flag anymore.</v>

732
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It's too bigger idea served its </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

733
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.453
<v Speaker 1>Nationalisms broke globalization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>type that we've had so far hasn't </v>

734
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Balderdash and has led to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reemergence,</v>

735
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:48.174
<v Speaker 1>hasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of um,</v>

736
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.240
<v Speaker 1>trumpkins Pumpkin as I like to call him.</v>

737
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

738
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.550
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have to figure it out in a,</v>

739
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.600
<v Speaker 3>in a big hurry because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

740
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.770
<v Speaker 3>the climate clock has striking midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a lot of time to,</v>

741
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.260
<v Speaker 3>to have a wakeup call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting,</v>

742
00:38:06.261 --> 00:38:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was writing my previous book,</v>

743
00:38:08.211 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 3>this changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

744
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.180
<v Speaker 3>my working title for that book was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message,</v>

745
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because told you not to do that.</v>

746
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.510
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you search on the message,</v>

747
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:22.460
<v Speaker 3>you just get all this Bible stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

748
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just really creepy.</v>

749
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

750
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.970
<v Speaker 3>but the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the message,</v>

751
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.213
<v Speaker 3>but the message was going to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Homework was going to be messages that </v>

752
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:38.660
<v Speaker 3>climate change isn't an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a message that is speaking to us in</v>

753
00:38:38.661 --> 00:38:39.494
<v Speaker 3>the language of floods and fires and </v>
<v Speaker 3>storms and it's telling us to wake up </v>

754
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 3>and it's telling us to evolve and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling us that this system is broken.</v>

755
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we are in this,</v>

756
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 3>at this moment of overlapping system </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>

757
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think inequality is,</v>

758
00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 3>is an extraordinarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just completely untenable levels.</v>

759
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I think thousands of people drowning in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mediterranean is also a message that</v>

760
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:05.854
<v Speaker 3>this is completely untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think grenfell tower is a message and </v>

761
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if there's some hope,</v>

762
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:14.404
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's that people are understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more these crises are messages </v>

763
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 3>of system failure as soon as that fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

764
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:24.903
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

765
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was understood as being so far beyond</v>

766
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.620
<v Speaker 3>this one building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an expression of all of these failed</v>

767
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

768
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:34.703
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this and this failed worldview and </v>

769
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>the cruelty at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the center of it.</v>

770
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people are getting that in an instant</v>

771
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:42.664
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

772
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.960
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there,</v>

773
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that it is possible to have kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of punctuated transformation,</v>

774
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 3>these moments where suddenly things </v>
<v Speaker 3>start changing very quickly.</v>

775
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

776
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:59.821
<v Speaker 3>if we look at moments where there has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a radical progressive change,</v>

777
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 3>it does tend to happen all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>

778
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 3>When did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

779
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

780
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.160
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the,</v>

781
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 3>in the midst of the Great Depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>after World War II,</v>

782
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.340
<v Speaker 3>after depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do suppression,</v>

783
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.760
<v Speaker 3>new deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social security,</v>

784
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the second world war,</v>

785
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 3>public health care and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

786
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the environmental law laws,</v>

787
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 3>the legal infrastructure protecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>endangered species.</v>

788
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happened one like,</v>

789
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.473
<v Speaker 3>like just a flurry of laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things with big responses to like </v>

790
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 3>everyone's fogged out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

791
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Lots of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about what happened in</v>

792
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:42.754
<v Speaker 3>the Great Depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you think there was a huge </v>

793
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:44.870
<v Speaker 3>number of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

794
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.753
<v Speaker 3>we better start now because there's too </v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them on my off the Second World </v>

795
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.330
<v Speaker 3>War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

796
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.870
<v Speaker 3>we've just killed millions of people.</v>

797
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.580
<v Speaker 3>We better do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like these things are like isn't</v>

798
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.580
<v Speaker 3>in a way while suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>numerous positive benefits,</v>

799
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.820
<v Speaker 3>just a way of power maintain in itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>like centralized power going,</v>

800
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 3>well this is the bare minimum we can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bare minimum we can do.</v>

801
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.903
<v Speaker 3>There's just got a bit higher for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment they're going to need to help </v>

802
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after that we can probably carry on </v>

803
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:08.930
<v Speaker 3>doing what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

804
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 3>What we actually need is a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>deconstruction of power.</v>

805
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.863
<v Speaker 3>Like isn't it like anything that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be good to have some big </v>

806
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:17.194
<v Speaker 3>jazzy global campaigns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very visually effective and </v>

807
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:22.580
<v Speaker 3>potent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we are going to destroy apple logo,</v>

808
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.433
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're going to take one big </v>

809
00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 3>corporation and we organize a global </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

810
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.604
<v Speaker 3>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It probably sounds a bit less popular </v>

811
00:41:28.571 --> 00:41:29.404
<v Speaker 3>and brilliant products got off that </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone or gm or something where you can </v>

812
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>say like that thing</v>

813
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 1>that's digital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 1>so fruit globalize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking of the brand,</v>

815
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 1>protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just to demonstrate,</v>

816
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but at the same way like to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potency of mobilization,</v>

817
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 1>to take one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one victory to one symbol,</v>

818
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 1>one thing go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we attack that thing?</v>

819
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That was the plot of the TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that hacker show?</v>

820
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Russell branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it what Mr.</v>

821
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:58.303
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot.</v>

822
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Mr Roberts said what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it go well for Mr.</v>

823
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Robot was the second series of Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robot,</v>

824
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.293
<v Speaker 1>get back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me if the revolutionary idea of </v>

825
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>bringing down one massive bluechip </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation works.</v>

826
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Not Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good idea,</v>

827
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.893
<v Speaker 1>Naomi.</v>

828
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was interested in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with geodes about just,</v>

829
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the power and the being in </v>

830
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:26.594
<v Speaker 3>these rooms filled with supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful people in the power isn't </v>

831
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:29.744
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

832
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.640
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

833
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:32.474
<v Speaker 3>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people could see a deconstruction of </v>

834
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 3>one of these symbols of what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deep state,</v>

835
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be quite empowering.</v>

836
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.540
<v Speaker 3>But I also think it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this spell of powerlessness,</v>

837
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:48.284
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this extreme era of corporate power </v>

838
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

839
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 3>that in most parts of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Neo liberalism.</v>

840
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that really is dying.</v>

841
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.263
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

842
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 1>or is it mutating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

843
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 1>How do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

844
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 1>what evidence is there a bit dying?</v>

845
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

846
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.453
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a Zombie ideology because as it </v>

847
00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 3>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was it.</v>

848
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.063
<v Speaker 3>This was a project of ideas that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>true believers that would sit down and </v>

849
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.580
<v Speaker 3>earnestly tell you that if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>privatized,</v>

850
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

851
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.620
<v Speaker 3>the rails for energy and water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good things will happen,</v>

852
00:43:22.621 --> 00:43:23.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will work better,</v>

853
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:24.960
<v Speaker 3>they will be cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

854
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.033
<v Speaker 3>there aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody left to defend </v>

855
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.610
<v Speaker 3>deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privatization,</v>

856
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.370
<v Speaker 3>low taxes and cuts to social spending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

857
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.223
<v Speaker 3>it's stumbling around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you accurately described as </v>

858
00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:38.250
<v Speaker 3>kind of a Zombie ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

859
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.113
<v Speaker 3>Because it has its own momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is why we're in this very </v>

860
00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:43.524
<v Speaker 3>dangerous moment because there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacuum of ideas and these very </v>

861
00:43:46.471 --> 00:43:47.304
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing white supremacist type or </v>

862
00:43:49.741 --> 00:43:54.741
<v Speaker 3>misogynist ideas are surging represented</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the donald trumps of the world.</v>

863
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.120
<v Speaker 3>And the meeting the pens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough of them.</v>

864
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Or is it because we live in bubbles all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day?</v>

865
00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.993
<v Speaker 3>All I'd ever meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never made people who actually </v>

866
00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:03.210
<v Speaker 3>sincerely go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's a that Donald Trump.</v>

867
00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I never meet them or they just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say out loud.</v>

868
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

869
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're out there.</v>

870
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.340
<v Speaker 3>They're out there in the voting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

871
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.593
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the forces that he's tapping </v>

872
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:17.040
<v Speaker 3>into never went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't create it,</v>

873
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:17.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

874
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.580
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this vacuum is potent.</v>

875
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.443
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also is filled with </v>

876
00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:25.330
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

877
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.253
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like it's this very slow </v>

878
00:44:29.311 --> 00:44:33.020
<v Speaker 3>decomposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this slow and the part of the neoliberal</v>

879
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.990
<v Speaker 3>project that is slowest to die is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the policies we can.</v>

880
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:38.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

881
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:39.684
<v Speaker 3>I was on the BBC this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the fact that the </v>

882
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Tory government here is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>abolishing tuition fees.</v>

883
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody left to defend austerity,</v>

884
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.160
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

885
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.073
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that the piece of it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was sturdiest was there is no </v>

886
00:44:58.291 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 3>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

887
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.953
<v Speaker 3>More on the imagination is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlasted the policies themselves and </v>

888
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:06.114
<v Speaker 3>that's what starting to lift because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this whole generation of young </v>

889
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:09.564
<v Speaker 3>people who didn't get the indoctrination</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you got and that I got because </v>

890
00:45:13.591 --> 00:45:14.424
<v Speaker 3>their whole adult life is post 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial crisis when all the true </v>

891
00:45:18.601 --> 00:45:19.434
<v Speaker 3>believers fled for the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are still trying to oppose brutal </v>

892
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 3>imposed brutal austerity on Greece and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spain.</v>

893
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:26.873
<v Speaker 3>But there's nobody out there saying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be good and don't you dare </v>

894
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:31.270
<v Speaker 3>think anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

895
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 3>So they're free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're much freer than we were.</v>

896
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.103
<v Speaker 3>They never got the hard sell on </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment and I think I'll give him a </v>

897
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:43.180
<v Speaker 3>bit of an indoctrinating myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

898
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by the inner trump?</v>

899
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by the trump within?</v>

900
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this comes back to,</v>

901
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of treating trump as totally </v>

902
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I,</v>

903
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 3>when I first started working on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

904
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.103
<v Speaker 3>I just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a literary festival and they </v>

905
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.600
<v Speaker 3>seated me next to a real Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrat.</v>

906
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

907
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.910
<v Speaker 3>and I explained the book I was working </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and you know,</v>

908
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:10.763
<v Speaker 3>trump as sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the logical conclusion of all of these </v>

909
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:16.014
<v Speaker 3>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was sort of nodding along and </v>

910
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.211
<v Speaker 3>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:46:19.211 --> 00:46:19.831
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

912
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

913
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>these are American trans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>

914
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like we're Obama,</v>

915
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she wanted to just completely </v>

916
00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 3>disavow trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.090
<v Speaker 3>that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was only red states.</v>

918
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 3>It was only the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

919
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:37.300
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with the broader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

920
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the broader culture.</v>

921
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just don't buy it.</v>

922
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just see him as just this </v>

923
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of everything that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going wrong in our culture.</v>

924
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Just this for our fractured attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>span.</v>

925
00:46:51.191 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he doesn't read just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

926
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 3>give it to me in a list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

927
00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Alyssa is what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

928
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:07.870
<v Speaker 3>he's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is growing punishment.</v>

929
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Make another list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll be a good experiment.</v>

930
00:47:11.151 --> 00:47:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

931
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.720
<v Speaker 3>don't do things that run shorter list 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that room</v>

932
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.323
<v Speaker 1>that is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is symptomatic or not that </v>

933
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.723
<v Speaker 1>because how could it be otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like what people's unwillingness </v>

934
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 1>through revise the Obama presidency </v>
<v Speaker 1>because not now obviously comparatively,</v>

935
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>superficially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

936
00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 1>he seems like some sort of gorgeous </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

937
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:38.010
<v Speaker 1>But actually what he was doing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>laying the foundations for what happened</v>

938
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380
<v Speaker 1>subsequently because you can't ask trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what happened before it was nice.</v>

939
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.211
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

940
00:47:44.211 --> 00:47:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I think with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the,</v>

941
00:47:45.771 --> 00:47:46.604
<v Speaker 3>part of my argument that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is most uncomfortable for American </v>

942
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:51.323
<v Speaker 3>liberals is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the argument that I don't think we </v>

943
00:47:55.101 --> 00:47:59.250
<v Speaker 3>could have trump without Bill Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bill gates because the,</v>

944
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.460
<v Speaker 3>those two men more than any others </v>
<v Speaker 3>fostered this idea that billionaires are</v>

945
00:48:04.671 --> 00:48:05.850
<v Speaker 3>gonna save us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

946
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.780
<v Speaker 3>We don't have billionaires are countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

947
00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Richard Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to fix climate change right</v>

948
00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 3>in his spare time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

949
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.130
<v Speaker 3>and Bill Gates is going to fix malaria </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't need,</v>

950
00:48:19.131 --> 00:48:19.964
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had bill gates now has more power </v>

951
00:48:21.111 --> 00:48:22.520
<v Speaker 3>than the World Health Organization.</v>

952
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:22.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

953
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I went to this island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson's island,</v>

954
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owned it.</v>

955
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:33.720
<v Speaker 1>It was in the British Virgin Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a tax haven and on it there was a</v>

956
00:48:33.721 --> 00:48:34.554
<v Speaker 1>symposium being held that was about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>are we going to make the world a better </v>

957
00:48:38.811 --> 00:48:42.800
<v Speaker 1>place and one of the things I said so </v>
<v Speaker 1>while on the island and which expediated</v>

958
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>by hasty departure by teddy atlas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower like one.</v>

959
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:47.893
<v Speaker 1>This is a tax haven in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we just live like operate </v>

960
00:48:52.381 --> 00:48:53.214
<v Speaker 1>within the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the existing systems will be </v>

961
00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:55.554
<v Speaker 1>slightly better than this one and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend actually said like during the </v>

962
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.440
<v Speaker 1>eighties when everything was whoosh </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash,</v>

963
00:49:01.441 --> 00:49:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wallop,</v>

964
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:03.083
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson was bombing about not </v>
<v Speaker 1>air balloons and speed boats and </v>

965
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.800
<v Speaker 1>everyone's shitting themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

966
00:49:07.801 --> 00:49:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we should legalize drugs and you</v>

967
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.114
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sort of a bit more concerned for </v>

968
00:49:12.451 --> 00:49:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again an attempt to rebrand,</v>

969
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:20.570
<v Speaker 1>cooperate and appropriate the conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>energies of an awakening people,</v>

970
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but of course trump is intimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to a Bama,</v>

971
00:49:24.241 --> 00:49:25.074
<v Speaker 1>to Bill Gates to Bill Clinton because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one interconnected system that's </v>

972
00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:28.494
<v Speaker 1>feeding off itself.</v>

973
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Now the other risk we have is getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

974
00:49:30.361 --> 00:49:31.194
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering into what our call with love </v>

975
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:34.590
<v Speaker 1>and affection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ICC paddock,</v>

976
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.620
<v Speaker 1>where David Eick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

977
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.613
<v Speaker 1>like were sort of like if you've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to much about sort of interconnected </v>

978
00:49:40.291 --> 00:49:43.050
<v Speaker 1>global systems that feed each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold each other together,</v>

979
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.740
<v Speaker 1>have operated for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People's,</v>

980
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.470
<v Speaker 1>let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang on a second.</v>

981
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:50.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a big crack pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very much value research based,</v>

982
00:49:50.191 --> 00:49:51.024
<v Speaker 1>empirical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular sounding data because I think </v>

983
00:49:53.641 --> 00:49:54.474
<v Speaker 1>it's vital to be taken seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow there has to be a marriage </v>

984
00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.213
<v Speaker 1>between this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this academic data based researched </v>

985
00:50:04.291 --> 00:50:09.291
<v Speaker 1>proper academic staff and the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnection with people,</v>

986
00:50:09.421 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the ability to stir viscerally human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

987
00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:15.390
<v Speaker 1>to make them die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

988
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>

989
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:20.370
<v Speaker 1>which they're not going to do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia.</v>

990
00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.290
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

991
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

992
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:27.383
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in a beautiful moment where </v>

993
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.900
<v Speaker 3>these words worlds are converging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

994
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.013
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we're learning from </v>

995
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 3>science is intensely beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual.</v>

996
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.040
<v Speaker 3>We talk about it as if it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>dry and remote.</v>

997
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the study of life.</v>

998
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

999
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but because I suppose that that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself got colonized.</v>

1000
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.950
<v Speaker 1>The idea of scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1001
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:52.784
<v Speaker 1>endeavor became mechanized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that's the most research is </v>

1002
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:57.100
<v Speaker 1>funded is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the,</v>

1003
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>where the funding comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

1004
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 1>who does the grail serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does the grail serve Naomi.</v>

1005
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Now my producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not my producer.</v>

1006
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.243
<v Speaker 1>He's a free independent human being who </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be producing this show is </v>

1007
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>holding up a bit of paper that says No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically whiteboard says change.</v>

1008
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Or I come a normally we can do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1009
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter,</v>

1010
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.540
<v Speaker 1>recapturing the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he's not,</v>

1011
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 1>imagination isn't recaptured by my </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ranting.</v>

1012
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:24.224
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was wrong with him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Naomi's leap manifesto that's covered </v>

1013
00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 1>these topics before you go off to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>next appointment,</v>

1014
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:31.514
<v Speaker 1>probably the mainstream media little </v>
<v Speaker 1>snip your words of wisdom into some </v>

1015
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 1>actually meeting with some black lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter activists about Grenville Tower.</v>

1016
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my cell out appointment of the </v>

1017
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This and that.</v>

1018
00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not true with an entered Martin </v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>

1019
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.313
<v Speaker 1>There you go right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in a way you're creating </v>

1020
00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:51.490
<v Speaker 1>steadily more authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1021
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.333
<v Speaker 1>you to talk to other black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to commune with pure </v>

1022
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:54.854
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1023
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:56.721
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1024
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1025
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.073
<v Speaker 3>I think what that is a reference to as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>section in the book about the fact that </v>

1026
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.750
<v Speaker 3>social movements really are recovering </v>
<v Speaker 3>the utopian imagination,</v>

1027
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 3>really dreaming and public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just being an opposition.</v>

1028
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:12.884
<v Speaker 3>And one of them most inspiring examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this is the movement for black lives </v>

1029
00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:17.300
<v Speaker 3>and in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States,</v>

1030
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:21.710
<v Speaker 3>which came up with this policy platform </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the vision for black lives,</v>

1031
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1032
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a political platform without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political party.</v>

1033
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:28.783
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it came out about through a very </v>

1034
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:36.080
<v Speaker 3>participatory grassroots process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the,</v>

1035
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.173
<v Speaker 3>it is a response not only to police </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence though though it is that it </v>

1036
00:52:41.811 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 3>covers everything from abolishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons,</v>

1037
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 3>the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>restructuring the tax system,</v>

1038
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:51.680
<v Speaker 3>reparations for slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very,</v>

1039
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:52.514
<v Speaker 3>very bold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what we haven't seen from </v>

1040
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 3>progressive movements is coming together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying,</v>

1041
00:52:56.781 --> 00:52:57.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1042
00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:01.180
<v Speaker 3>what does the world look like after we </v>
<v Speaker 3>win a vision?</v>

1043
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:02.283
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I say the last piece of </v>

1044
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:08.530
<v Speaker 3>the neoliberal project to die is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>war on the imagination and the,</v>

1045
00:53:08.531 --> 00:53:12.410
<v Speaker 3>the leap manifesto is it is a project </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've been involved in in Canada,</v>

1046
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 3>which was an attempt to do this a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years ago.</v>

1047
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:20.021
<v Speaker 3>We helped host a meeting of 60 movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizers from a broad cross section of</v>

1048
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:22.400
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous rights,</v>

1049
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.200
<v Speaker 3>food justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate,</v>

1050
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:25.610
<v Speaker 3>labor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1051
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some faith organizations coming together</v>

1052
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.980
<v Speaker 3>and just trying to agree on the yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1053
00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:33.843
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what was so interesting about that </v>

1054
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:38.100
<v Speaker 3>at meeting was just how hard it was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be honest.</v>

1055
00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:39.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that muscle,</v>

1056
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have a muscle memory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreeing on what we want.</v>

1057
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 3>We had a memory of coming together to </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppose things.</v>

1058
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 3>We'd come together to say we don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>this free trade deal.</v>

1059
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 3>We hate this politician.</v>

1060
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 3>We don't want this austerity bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1061
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 3>but we did not have experience of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1062
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 3>what does it look like when we win?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1063
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.920
<v Speaker 3>what do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we agree on about what the world</v>

1064
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:02.754
<v Speaker 3>should look like in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that we had to do </v>

1065
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.613
<v Speaker 3>was not rely on some easy nostalgia of </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like this idea that everything was </v>

1066
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.414
<v Speaker 3>great in the 19 seventies because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous people in the room and the </v>

1067
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:18.300
<v Speaker 3>people representing immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations in the room,</v>

1068
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:19.134
<v Speaker 3>we're just having none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not romanticizing the </v>

1069
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:22.254
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to have to gain our left </v>

1070
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:28.380
<v Speaker 3>movements have done that for far too </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

1071
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to have to be inspired by</v>

1072
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 3>a world we haven't seen yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't created yet.</v>

1073
00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:35.071
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

1074
00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 3>if people are interested they can go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the leap.org.</v>

1075
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested and I'm a people and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>include the whole manifesto at the,</v>

1076
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:43.680
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the book too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not long,</v>

1077
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 3>it's 1400 words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people are rewriting it,</v>

1078
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 3>that some people are using it to run </v>
<v Speaker 3>slates of candidates to take over.</v>

1079
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:52.520
<v Speaker 3>City Council will use that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

1080
00:54:52.521 --> 00:54:53.354
<v Speaker 3>you're not waiting for a politician to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come along and figure all this out </v>

1081
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:58.703
<v Speaker 3>because I think we are in a moment where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are maybe a little vulnerable to </v>

1082
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:06.870
<v Speaker 3>save yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of trouble because,</v>

1083
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you this,</v>

1084
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.333
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my joke about your Messiah tour is not </v>

1085
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.280
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long shot.</v>

1086
00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It's people like you who I worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1087
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit of archive that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get pulled up in 20 years.</v>

1088
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Here's Naomi Klein is fueled in a brand </v>
<v Speaker 1>archive is a.</v>

1089
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.700
<v Speaker 1>don't call me that in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1090
00:55:27.701 --> 00:55:30.070
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

1091
00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the main things I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this conversation and really,</v>

1092
00:55:33.071 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed was allowed to miss him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lot the idea that we got the twitching</v>

1093
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:37.984
<v Speaker 1>Zombie corpse of capitalism lunging </v>
<v Speaker 1>about now lashing about all baffled and </v>

1094
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:45.640
<v Speaker 1>confused and bereft of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a necessity for New Vision.</v>

1095
00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:46.623
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we got from Naomi </v>
<v Speaker 1>client and what you were saying about </v>

1096
00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:49.754
<v Speaker 1>like some of those protests we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people is a reimagining of </v>

1097
00:55:52.241 --> 00:55:56.380
<v Speaker 1>interconnectivity and oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which previously has been regarded.</v>

1098
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.320
<v Speaker 1>The terrain of what I noticed you call </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith organizations.</v>

1099
00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:00.243
<v Speaker 1>I think more of them kind of summarize </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people diverse people to come up </v>

1100
00:56:02.411 --> 00:56:07.411
<v Speaker 1>with an opposing on subsequent vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real powerful.</v>

1101
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:09.003
<v Speaker 1>I like that and we're going to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap dot Org and learn more to see if </v>

1102
00:56:12.071 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 1>people can run that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch out for.</v>

1103
00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't follow leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch your pocket.</v>

1104
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.083
<v Speaker 1>Me Watch out for Messiah Masonic figures</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of the other things we've </v>

1105
00:56:18.251 --> 00:56:19.084
<v Speaker 1>learned as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1106
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have free people like don't point</v>

1107
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.140
<v Speaker 1>is rude to point and say you enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that big bucket of customers.</v>

1108
