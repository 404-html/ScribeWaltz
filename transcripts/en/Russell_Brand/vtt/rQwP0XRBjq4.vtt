1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>One imagines that perhaps we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>created through society for what is </v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.944
<v Speaker 1>society butter pattern patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward behaviors in patterns within us </v>

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>that are either negligent or detrimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>or toxic or psychopathic.</v>

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.253
<v Speaker 1>Do you think of many of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in positions of power and the </v>

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>structures that surround them and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that they perpetuate,</v>

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.613
<v Speaker 1>that these are the product of negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent thinking and the kind of </v>

7
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>spiritual shift taking place on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual level if significantly spread</v>

8
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.494
<v Speaker 1>could bring about the kind of change </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's required and indeed would be </v>

9
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>called revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>so when I look at it,</v>

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.913
<v Speaker 2>people who are in power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was interesting because I was </v>

12
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.634
<v Speaker 2>listening to your podcast or Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he and then he was kind of </v>

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>rationalizing the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.823
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I look at actually who forms </v>

15
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>the epics of the hierarchy in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>society is largely traumatized people.</v>

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

17
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>if you believe you live in a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

18
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be aggressive,</v>

19
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 2>grandiose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoid,</v>

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 2>a selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

21
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:09.794
<v Speaker 2>you'd be the president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States because he's the one who said in </v>

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>so many words that the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible place,</v>

23
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's the world he lives in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Buddha said,</v>

24
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

25
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that was a miser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create the world,</v>

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.003
<v Speaker 2>but my contention is that before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our minds to create the world that </v>

27
00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:25.564
<v Speaker 2>will create some mines and trump's brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>was formed in a family where he was </v>

28
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:34.541
<v Speaker 2>demeaned and punished and attacked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>humiliated by his father.</v>

29
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And so he believes he lives in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible world.</v>

30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 2>That's what he acts out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his brother drank himself to death.</v>

31
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.293
<v Speaker 2>So is this traumatized people now his </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent I could go into that was also </v>

32
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>traumatized,</v>

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that in here,</v>

34
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were too traumatized people.</v>

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Doumergue fighting to govern a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized world.</v>

36
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

37
00:01:59.411 --> 00:01:59.801
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

38
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:00.634
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hillary's drama showed up in when </v>

39
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 2>she had pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wouldn't even acknowledge it because</v>

40
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 2>as a child she'd been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to suck up her pain.</v>

41
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>She mustn't be vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She puts up with the philandering of her</v>

42
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 2>husband who is as much of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explorative women is Donald Trump over,</v>

44
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 2>was just not as egregious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she's still justifies it.</v>

45
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.803
<v Speaker 2>And so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

46
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 2>her messages to become inauthentic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck it all up.</v>

47
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's her form of trauma.</v>

48
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about British politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

49
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I could talk about what did everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're on a roll.</v>

50
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I could talk about this repressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

51
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was so in denial of own trauma that </v>

52
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 2>she's willing to traumatize the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable people in society.</v>

53
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Her name was Margaret Thatcher.</v>

54
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>What was head trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this.</v>

55
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of,</v>

56
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>a bit like in the Matrix when neo Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's made out a numbers.</v>

57
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 1>You look at people and you see all their</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma and damage.</v>

58
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.880
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

59
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.713
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw in her a tremendous oppressed </v>

60
00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

61
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.923
<v Speaker 2>I saw then you have a bland faced </v>
<v Speaker 2>schoolboy who's willing to murder </v>

62
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never taken any responsibility for it.</v>

63
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.973
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it still doesn't deal with the </v>

64
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>impact of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is Tony Blair,</v>

65
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>who's quite willing to go to a bomb drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

66
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.940
<v Speaker 2>drop bombs on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

67
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 2>on Arabs for away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll do it in,</v>

68
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.091
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

69
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:24.924
<v Speaker 2>in the service of lies that if schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>could see through and these are </v>

70
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 2>traumatized people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they couldn't do it.</v>

71
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:32.854
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be that split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these are the people that our </v>

72
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 2>society rewards with power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a sign of a traumatized society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my next book.</v>

74
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>It's good that asking to be a smash hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one.</v>

75
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Banging to that already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to write it first.</v>

76
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 2>You've done the hot book will come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a concept.</v>

77
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.393
<v Speaker 2>The restaurants itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what about the can we carry on with </v>

78
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>this game of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm marking off the powerful because I'm</v>

79
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 2>loving this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what can we say like,</v>

80
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Barack Obama.</v>

81
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a continuum.</v>

82
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama is a fascinating case going.</v>

83
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>People talk about trump is destroying </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>

84
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>His legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

85
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Trump is Obama's legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

86
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I read his biography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a person that's very chameleon like</v>

87
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.323
<v Speaker 2>he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not deliberately and not even </v>

88
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>necessarily consciously a the identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>with whoever,</v>

89
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>so so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can sound like a white man or you</v>

90
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 2>can sound like a black man depending on </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's at.</v>

91
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So he appealed to both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think his biggest,</v>

92
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.983
<v Speaker 2>his biggest sin was to have enrolled a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people in the possibility of </v>

93
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 2>transformation and change without </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering any of it.</v>

94
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 2>For the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the inability of these</v>

95
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>individuals to manifest real change is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration.</v>

96
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.643
<v Speaker 2>What we have are deeply entrenched and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatized systems that are predicated </v>

97
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.073
<v Speaker 2>on unconscious choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious drives and that the system </v>

98
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.963
<v Speaker 2>cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not alter itself from within </v>

99
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:04.414
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will sustain itself and it's only </v>

100
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 2>sort of new radical ideas that can alter</v>
<v Speaker 2>it well.</v>

101
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Any system is designed in such a way as </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make change impossible.</v>

102
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>That that's just the nature of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization in the system so that.</v>

103
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't matter what.</v>

104
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Even if Obama came along fully committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his agenda,</v>

105
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 2>which I believe on some level he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sincere book.</v>

106
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.083
<v Speaker 2>That would have been a million reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why the system and how the system would </v>

107
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 2>have prevented him from carrying an </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda,</v>

108
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>but let me ask you something.</v>

109
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Were assert something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama got into par,</v>

110
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 2>funded heavily by Wall Street is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>street stupid or do they or do they know</v>

111
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>which side they're butter bread is </v>
<v Speaker 2>buttered on.</v>

112
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.683
<v Speaker 2>They knew what they were getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't buy into the whole pre </v>

113
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.873
<v Speaker 2>changing kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you exactly what a what a fast </v>

114
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.734
<v Speaker 2>style and inefficient servant of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>status quo he would be and those </v>

115
00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>students is again to power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then your bills out Wall Street,</v>

116
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.223
<v Speaker 2>he was transferred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was responsible for one of the </v>

117
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 2>greatest transfers of wealth upwards in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and and and,</v>

118
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.683
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the system you what they were </v>

119
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the rest of us,</v>

120
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.183
<v Speaker 2>because we want to believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive side of his persona because </v>

121
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 2>sucked in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never got sucked in by him.</v>

122
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.863
<v Speaker 1>Why this but wielded clinging to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives that have clearly been </v>

123
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:31.360
<v Speaker 1>exposed is erroneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why now post trump do we.</v>

124
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.253
<v Speaker 1>Why are we seeing from the liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment and a sort of a nostalgia </v>

125
00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:36.694
<v Speaker 1>for something that was basically about </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes ago rather than an </v>

126
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.820
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement and a recognition of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>need for meaningful,</v>

127
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>significant change that addresses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of essentially the poor.</v>

128
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the,</v>

129
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.043
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you look at see American politics </v>

130
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>or economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

131
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Obama was as ready as anybody to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>people abroad.</v>

132
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was as,</v>

133
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.710
<v Speaker 2>as anybody to send troops overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

134
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than American history </v>
<v Speaker 2>has always been.</v>

135
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was smoother about it.</v>

136
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>He was more urbane about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a more articulate about it.</v>

137
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.380
<v Speaker 2>He also knew how to speak to people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>better sides.</v>

138
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Along comes trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's agregious.</v>

139
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.640
<v Speaker 2>He's a highly traumatized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utterly self unrestrained,</v>

140
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.313
<v Speaker 2>a troubled schoolyard bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's offensive to the </v>

141
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.663
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sensibilities of the liberal </v>

142
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:46.560
<v Speaker 2>establishment to have somebody like </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump represent them.</v>

143
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to genuine policy,</v>

144
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference between these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

145
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the system wants people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can make it more palatable and trump</v>

146
00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 2>makes it very unpalatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so trump has woken us up,</v>

147
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.820
<v Speaker 2>but it unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the liberal outreach has been a</v>

148
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.340
<v Speaker 2>trump personally rather than at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

149
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.720
<v Speaker 2>and rather than at the system that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents no bursts or no better,</v>

150
00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:14.970
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've represented more worse than,</v>

151
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.673
<v Speaker 2>even a Bush or Clinton or Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly can be much more effective in </v>

153
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.080
<v Speaker 2>representing the system.</v>

154
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And trump is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Thompson is.</v>

155
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.253
<v Speaker 2>Trump's son is not in what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump's son is in his personal </v>

156
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:32.670
<v Speaker 2>egregious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a in your face.</v>

157
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.593
<v Speaker 2>This function.</v>

158
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it that trump is not an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is revelation.</v>

159
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Trump reveal sales.</v>

160
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what trump does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they can't forgive him.</v>

161
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

162
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

163
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 2>That's that personally I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

164
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.893
<v Speaker 2>And by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way I'm speaking of all of them </v>

165
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 2>are traumatized people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an Obama was abandoned by his father</v>

166
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and he idealize this father in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs my father or,</v>

167
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I forget what the title of it was.</v>

168
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Something quite sentimental songs but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

169
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:05.611
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

170
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

171
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.923
<v Speaker 2>but he was a traumatized person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then his mother was a high troubled </v>

172
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 2>individual and he was going to buy his </v>
<v Speaker 2>white grandparents.</v>

173
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy suffered,</v>

174
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lacquered is suffering with this.</v>

175
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 2>But with this pattern of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rationality.</v>
