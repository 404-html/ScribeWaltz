1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v Speaker 1>Commonly referred to as the rock star </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist has been described as the </v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:05.424
<v Speaker 1>natural successor for BBC scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>programming by both David attenborough </v>

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.043
<v Speaker 1>and Patrick Moore on by some as </v>
<v Speaker 1>England's equivalent to Neil degrasse </v>

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must feel good,</v>

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>does it if you're a scientist to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>described in that way.</v>

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.203
<v Speaker 1>Not by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by David attenborough and I was there </v>

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>when he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he said it,</v>

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>actually I was presenting him with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>award.</v>

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It was a radio times awards I think as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented him with the,</v>

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>with the award and he stood up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone and then said,</v>

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>if I had a torch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I pass it to you?</v>

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.973
<v Speaker 1>And then went and sat down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's nothing you can </v>

13
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought about it since the.</v>

14
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.863
<v Speaker 1>The real answer is that the Columbia </v>
<v Speaker 1>successor in the way that can't be a </v>

15
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>successor to Neil Armstrong because </v>
<v Speaker 1>David attenborough was the.</v>

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>He invented the form really naturally be</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary was pioneered by him.</v>

17
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>So he's the first and still the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched blue planet two,</v>

18
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>that he's still making groundbreaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>So there will ever be another one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 50 years of natural history,</v>

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.343
<v Speaker 1>possibly what he's referring to in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of succession is a sort of </v>

21
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.214
<v Speaker 1>popularization and humanization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it could be such word of data and </v>

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>information that can have previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>been somewhat esoteric and inaccessible.</v>

23
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.124
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that must be one aspect of </v>

24
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>your work that's difficult to quantify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your personal charisma,</v>

25
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.313
<v Speaker 1>your particular success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that you have as much </v>

26
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>impact on you psychologically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.863
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first thing is humanization </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a good word actually because I think </v>

28
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that science is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

30
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the study of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

31
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a humble pursuit.</v>

32
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.893
<v Speaker 1>It's about just looking at essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>small things and asking very simple </v>

33
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a childlike questions now,</v>

34
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>why is the sky blue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that leaf green?</v>

35
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of those little points of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sky.</v>

36
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the things we find out a demand I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think demand the response there,</v>

37
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>especially when talking about cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.553
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the size and scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>and origin of the university theater </v>

39
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:13.824
<v Speaker 1>return or questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think they demand the human </v>

40
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>response and that's the thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>always felt I've went out when I was </v>

41
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.261
<v Speaker 1>little dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

42
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is looking up at the sky,</v>

43
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.513
<v Speaker 1>the feelings that you get from looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at those points of light and </v>

44
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>understanding they were the worlds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how far they are away.</v>

45
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

46
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our deep and challenging feelings.</v>

47
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I think people miss that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think of science as the thing you</v>

48
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>do in the lab with some batteries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

49
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.093
<v Speaker 1>You know that science is a switch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not questions about the origin of the </v>

50
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.044
<v Speaker 1>universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're precisely correct that </v>

51
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.843
<v Speaker 1>actually we don't spend enough time </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing that feeling and to continue </v>

52
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 2>comparison between yourself and David </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and borrow what one sense is,</v>

54
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.933
<v Speaker 2>is that he has a deep love of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject and it means something to him </v>

55
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>and he wants people to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you've just described,</v>

56
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 2>is that when you are for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the study of the cosmos is not about </v>

57
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>mathematics and relationships between </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical phenomena.</v>

58
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.453
<v Speaker 2>Abstract from the emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very much as if somehow the </v>

59
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.424
<v Speaker 2>experience of that emotion or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization of that motion or suddenly </v>

60
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.060
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between those emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you explain that a little bit of.</v>

61
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

62
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.363
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that signed the act of doing </v>

64
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.094
<v Speaker 3>science is an emotional response to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature and you said you see it with </v>

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 3>David attenborough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves life on earth.</v>

66
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 3>That living things he finds them </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>

67
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.564
<v Speaker 3>has a connection to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands that the idea that we are </v>

68
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.094
<v Speaker 3>part of one unbroken chain of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretching back 4 billion years is a </v>

69
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 3>powerful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I always think that you know when,</v>

70
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 3>when you look a blade of grass in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pavement,</v>

71
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>probably sticking up through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete,</v>

72
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.453
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of life on earth is written </v>

73
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 3>into that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the more,</v>

74
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 3>the more you understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you think about the things that</v>

75
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:09.964
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more powerful the experiences and </v>

76
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 3>the more challenging the thoughts are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sentence.</v>

77
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that in order to understand the</v>

78
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.264
<v Speaker 3>blade of grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand the history of </v>

79
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 3>life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four billion year timescales,</v>

80
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

81
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

82
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I think a challenging ideas immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

83
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 3>and they're emotionally challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

84
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.923
<v Speaker 3>So I think science is an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to the universe because you </v>

85
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 3>become a scientist when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you latch onto an idea like that.</v>

86
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.464
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what the origin of life </v>

87
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 3>was so I can understand the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I see</v>

88
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.633
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see in the minutiae of life at </v>

89
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 2>the continuum of nature and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

90
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that aperture,</v>

91
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 2>the most profound questions conceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 2>we have to imagine answers to them.</v>

93
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.223
<v Speaker 3>I think they all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the roads of inquiry leads to </v>

94
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 3>profound ideas and not always actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the statement we don't know.</v>

95
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 3>So we don't know yet if we ever will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

96
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 3>how life began probably began on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

97
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:20.074
<v Speaker 3>there are theories that it came the </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Panspermia that he began </v>

98
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else and then was brought here</v>
<v Speaker 3>by cometry.</v>

99
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Impact or asteroid is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unlikely though,</v>

100
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.533
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

101
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.393
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is there any significance to those </v>

102
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 2>theories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just philosophically,</v>

103
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:36.734
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that if life was at some point</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his stellar or an eclectic that it </v>

104
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.073
<v Speaker 2>interrupts the narrative of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of on at this point is they </v>

105
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:46.764
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are profound philosophical </v>

106
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.523
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it relevant and is there any reason </v>

107
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:50.384
<v Speaker 2>to believe it might be true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it doesn't matter so </v>

108
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>philosophically</v>

109
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.243
<v Speaker 3>because it had to begin someone because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know the universe was hot and 13 </v>

110
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:58.964
<v Speaker 3>point 8 billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a thing we called the big bang </v>

111
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>and we know that they wouldn't have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>any life around.</v>

112
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Then we just the physical conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>with far too extreme,</v>

113
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Speaker 3>so life began somewhere and the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to look at it,</v>

114
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:10.620
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lets,</v>

115
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 3>lets say began on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter though.</v>

116
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 3>It could have be going to Mars or </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else,</v>

117
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:14.834
<v Speaker 3>but the arguments the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means that geochemistry became </v>

118
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens somewhere most likely on</v>

119
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:24.254
<v Speaker 3>earth is that a dead planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in planet with a hot core and </v>

120
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.243
<v Speaker 3>volcanoes and those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chemical reactions happened in the </v>

121
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:39.821
<v Speaker 3>oceans which changed from geology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>geochemistry to biochemistry.</v>

122
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's a profound thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

123
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 3>The planet did almost certainly gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>birth to us,</v>

124
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 3>which is quite a nice age.</v>

125
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 3>It's an ancient philosophical idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very Atlantic gave birth to us,</v>

126
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's very light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>

127
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 3>guyer idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that,</v>

128
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.004
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the mother earth in a very literal </v>

129
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to have certain.</v>

130
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 3>What about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distinction between a geo and bio,</v>

131
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a life.</v>

132
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that so significant by one meter?</v>

133
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.133
<v Speaker 3>By what metric are we understanding life</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was a meteorological system </v>

134
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 3>that can produce life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that not in itself life?</v>

135
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

136
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.310
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost a semantic distinction in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way.</v>

137
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

138
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.124
<v Speaker 3>it still just chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when does Geo Chemistry become </v>

139
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.294
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the standard answer would be when </v>

140
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 3>molecules begin to self replicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be.</v>

141
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 3>So information can be passed from </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation to generation.</v>

142
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Once you've got that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have evolution,</v>

143
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have live,</v>

144
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to have some physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical,</v>

145
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.533
<v Speaker 3>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some molecule that can reproduce itself </v>

146
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.373
<v Speaker 3>and the inflammation in the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the molecule is passed on to the copy </v>

147
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.713
<v Speaker 3>and once you've got that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you basically got life guys </v>

148
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 3>determined as biology.</v>

149
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.113
<v Speaker 3>We can see that as biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self-replicate in molecules prior to </v>

150
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:03.344
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be tracked or understood in </v>

151
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've.</v>

152
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a system which can't pass </v>
<v Speaker 3>information on,</v>

153
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 3>then you can't have evolution and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't have evolution,</v>

154
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 3>you can't get the life that we see today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might.</v>

155
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:18.284
<v Speaker 3>You can't even get single celled </v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms because they are very </v>

156
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.624
<v Speaker 3>complicated bits of chemistry and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>key thing is how did chemistry gets so </v>

157
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.124
<v Speaker 3>complicated and I think the key to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you get something that can pass </v>

158
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>information so you don't lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

159
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 3>You add the information from generation </v>
<v Speaker 3>to generation.</v>

160
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.913
<v Speaker 3>Physical risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This distinction between geological </v>

161
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:37.394
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological life seems contingent on its </v>

162
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>relationship with us as the observer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we narrate that transition.</v>

163
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 3>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a semantic distinction as it</v>

164
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>is in both forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is chemistry,</v>

165
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.633
<v Speaker 3>is it not possible that our role as </v>
<v Speaker 3>observer and the way that we narrate </v>

166
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>information is the true determinant as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed</v>

167
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 1>to the observable and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely significant fact that cells </v>

168
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>are now self replicating to us as </v>
<v Speaker 1>observers.</v>

169
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.283
<v Speaker 1>That's extremely significant but only </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops to us as observers given in the </v>

170
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>great scope of 13 point 8 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this happening is some great,</v>

171
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aria of creation.</v>

172
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a really important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

173
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in the universe,</v>

174
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the value of civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know of one place in the universe</v>

175
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>where there in Richard fineman words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atoms that can contemplate atoms.</v>

176
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.243
<v Speaker 1>That's what we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is that we are the most </v>

177
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>valuable structures that we know of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

178
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say that,</v>

179
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people get very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.293
<v Speaker 1>people are liable to say things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I owe human to damaging the planet and </v>

181
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>we're better off without them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense,</v>

182
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

183
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:51.954
<v Speaker 1>the most remarkable thing about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical universe is that there are </v>

184
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>places where atoms can contemplate atoms</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one place that we know of,</v>

185
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>and that might be.</v>

186
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 1>We might be quite rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

187
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>We've looked a bit and we've seen no </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign of anyone else.</v>

188
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>We we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the great silence.</v>

189
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.043
<v Speaker 1>Astronomers call it the great silence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we listened with radio </v>

190
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.444
<v Speaker 1>telescopes and we look out into space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see no sign of any other civilizations </v>

191
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and so it could be quite a lonely </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence that we have here,</v>

192
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.543
<v Speaker 1>but therefore very valuable indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whilst I understand the necessity for </v>

193
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>science as the study of nature to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on evidence,</v>

194
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>in fact indeed that is its essence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is its modus operandi.</v>

195
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.104
<v Speaker 1>That is what defines it does not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement that until there is </v>

196
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:39.624
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stay with the assumption that there </v>

197
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.114
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we don't know is </v>

198
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>parenthesized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that lead to a sort of.</v>

199
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.343
<v Speaker 1>Do you not think that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitates the dogmatic aspect of </v>

200
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:49.884
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has meant that it's sort of </v>

201
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.624
<v Speaker 1>science has become somewhat doctrinaire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and informative of areas beyond the </v>

202
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 1>humble study of nature and it's becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

203
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 1>a kind of ideology that leads to </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialism,</v>

204
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and all of the other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are on that particular evolutionary</v>

205
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:06.910
<v Speaker 1>chain?</v>

206
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.743
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

207
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I hope not because it shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't,</v>

208
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about great scientists.</v>

209
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I've just not been able to drink tea </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

210
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Good professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't put that in your nose if you're </v>

211
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.763
<v Speaker 1>inhaling into your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know I've read about that because it's </v>

212
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:24.894
<v Speaker 1>got to go straight down into the tummy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's and lemonade and </v>

213
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>made it a later point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the science itself,</v>

214
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

215
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.463
<v Speaker 1>it's humble in the sense that it's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to small things and </v>

216
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about it.</v>

217
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>An example would be Einstein's theory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>general relativity,</v>

218
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 1>which is the framework within which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do cosmology,</v>

219
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.170
<v Speaker 1>which is the study of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are grandiose aimed,</v>

220
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the origin and evolution</v>

221
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big idea,</v>

222
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v Speaker 3>but Einstein's theory of general </v>
<v Speaker 3>relativity was conceived as a theory of </v>

223
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:58.444
<v Speaker 3>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a theory of how things move </v>

224
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 3>around in the vicinity of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

225
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 3>So it's talking about if you throw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball in the air,</v>

226
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.434
<v Speaker 3>what happens to it now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It perhaps had the moon goes around the </v>

227
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:12.301
<v Speaker 3>earth or the earth goes around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became a theory of the structure,</v>

228
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 3>the large scale structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe afterwards.</v>

229
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are very few scientists who try to</v>

230
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:21.904
<v Speaker 3>begin by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to answer the great </v>

231
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the theory of everything.</v>

232
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I want to understand the whole universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not the road to wisdom.</v>

233
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Actually in science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roadster,</v>

234
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 3>roadster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and knowledge.</v>

235
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:36.124
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge first and then wisdom is by </v>

236
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to small things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what we find.</v>

237
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I think because the universe appears to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be simple at its very basic level,</v>

238
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.033
<v Speaker 3>there are laws of nature that seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be accessible to us when we seem to be </v>

239
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 3>able to understand and there are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>few of them.</v>

240
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Then virtually all road roads of inquiry</v>
<v Speaker 3>lead you to,</v>

241
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 3>if you followed them to some depth to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

242
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.073
<v Speaker 3>well the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't call them truth because </v>

243
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 3>we have to say that we don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>full set of fundamental laws of nature.</v>

244
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:12.784
<v Speaker 3>We certainly know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the laws that we have at the moment </v>

245
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.183
<v Speaker 3>are incomplete now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they break down in certain </v>

246
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

247
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.734
<v Speaker 3>Einstein's theory doesn't work at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center of a black hole or the origin of </v>

248
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:24.574
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have the theoretical tools </v>

249
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 3>to talk about what happens right in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of a black hole,</v>

250
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

251
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.723
<v Speaker 3>So it was more the observation of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditional pattern as opposed to an </v>

252
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.934
<v Speaker 3>absolute truth because we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's on the reverse side of that </v>

253
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:36.790
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

254
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 3>do you think it would be there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just be models.</v>

255
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.950
<v Speaker 3>They are going to send models,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

256
00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way that reality works.</v>

257
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>What about mask?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

258
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.270
<v Speaker 3>we're with the thing that you said about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oppenheimer,</v>

259
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

260
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.063
<v Speaker 3>I was very intrigued by Oppenheimer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said that it was his discoveries </v>

261
00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:59.380
<v Speaker 3>that lead to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

262
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.214
<v Speaker 3>he ran the Manhattan project so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he became haunted by it as many </v>

263
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:05.900
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know,</v>

264
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.773
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he felt that the first bomb on </v>

265
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Hiroshima was so horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost justifiable in the sense that</v>

266
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 3>it was a act to end the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second one on Nagasaki,</v>

267
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:20.044
<v Speaker 3>I think he thought which gratuitous and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he felt the power that scientists and </v>

268
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:25.654
<v Speaker 3>engineers had given to politicians were </v>
<v Speaker 3>so great that the politicians wouldn't </v>

269
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.700
<v Speaker 3>be able to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be able to control it.</v>

270
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.743
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually said in the 19 fifties that </v>

271
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 3>he was surprised that we were still </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

272
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.423
<v Speaker 3>as did many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Feynman oil mentioned also </v>

273
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:38.944
<v Speaker 3>worked on the Manhattan project and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said he was very surprised that we were </v>

274
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:42.664
<v Speaker 3>here in the mid 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought that we would not control </v>

275
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:45.994
<v Speaker 3>this power and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually we have a remarkably up to </v>

276
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

277
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 3>70 years after we got that power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were still here,</v>

278
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 3>so we haven't used it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

279
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

280
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:00.824
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that oftentimes felt that there are </v>

281
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:08.170
<v Speaker 3>great lessons for the way that we run </v>
<v Speaker 3>society in the approach,</v>

282
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 3>the scientific approach which was abide </v>
<v Speaker 3>by analogy almost.</v>

283
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.574
<v Speaker 3>So these ideas that I've spoke about </v>
<v Speaker 3>already that we don't have absolute </v>

284
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:16.904
<v Speaker 3>truth in science and we don't think we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know anything for certain and we are </v>

285
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.453
<v Speaker 3>humble with the way that we approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature and crucially that our opinion </v>

286
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 3>counts for nothing in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

287
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.220
<v Speaker 3>If we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be shown to be wrong.</v>

288
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.310
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we should be delighted when we shown</v>

289
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:35.144
<v Speaker 3>to be wrong because it means we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned something and that's at the </v>

290
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:37.994
<v Speaker 3>heart of the scientific and Debra and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt those things could be translated </v>

291
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 3>from science to politics and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we run societies.</v>

292
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:46.484
<v Speaker 3>And then if we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would have the wisdom to control the </v>

293
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very beautiful ideology.</v>

294
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's sort of not underwritten by,</v>

295
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.933
<v Speaker 3>as you say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the idea of approaching nature </v>

296
00:15:57.531 --> 00:15:59.630
<v Speaker 3>with humility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with grace,</v>

297
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 3>with an understanding of our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations seems to me like a,</v>

298
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.780
<v Speaker 3>a spiritual doctrine that should be used</v>
<v Speaker 3>in precisely in politics,</v>

299
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:14.540
<v Speaker 3>in domestic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>familial life.</v>

300
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 3>This is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

301
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:16.424
<v Speaker 3>that is almost a universal idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach nature up with love and </v>

302
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.104
<v Speaker 3>compassion because obviously what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>very curious about what the one of the </v>

303
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 3>reasons I went to meet you for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect you enormously.</v>

304
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.293
<v Speaker 3>I respect what you've done and the depth</v>
<v Speaker 3>breadth of knowledge that you have and </v>

305
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 3>the way that you've conveyed it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

306
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 3>But I know that as a man of science that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

307
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I said Sova famously atheistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

308
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

309
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

310
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:40.731
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

311
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I reject the label because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's divisive and uh,</v>

312
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.183
<v Speaker 3>so I genuinely think that science does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not rule out the existence of a creator </v>

313
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by definition,</v>

314
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know how the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>began full stop.</v>

315
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.670
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

316
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.043
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a theory of what might've </v>

317
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 3>happened before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Big Bang theory called inflation,</v>

318
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 3>which says that the universe was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>around but doing something else,</v>

319
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 3>but we still left with the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did that start?</v>

320
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.310
<v Speaker 3>How did the universe have a beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if so,</v>

321
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:14.144
<v Speaker 3>how did it begin?</v>

322
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 3>The entries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

323
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.543
<v Speaker 3>Full Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't read it from a scientific </v>

324
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:20.564
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is wrong to say that science has </v>

325
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:26.260
<v Speaker 3>anything to say at all about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

326
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.741
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

327
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 3>the nature of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a creator or the,</v>

328
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

329
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the can be that because we don't know.</v>

330
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 3>That's all I say is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally have any faith.</v>

331
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I'd have a personal faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can dig into that.</v>

332
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.723
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean faith as in preexisting </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological structure that you use as a </v>

333
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:46.844
<v Speaker 3>framework for your understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality or do you mean faith as sort of </v>

334
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.214
<v Speaker 3>an inward that there is beauty and great</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when you said that humility and </v>

335
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:53.300
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounded like a faithful.</v>

336
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

337
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 3>so I suppose it depends and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about this more actually,</v>

338
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

339
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 3>how you define the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to me all,</v>

340
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I say that is I don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion that I adhere to.</v>

341
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.003
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not know what the origin of the </v>

342
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 3>laws of nature is and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's enough for me.</v>

343
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>

344
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel compelled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

345
00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel compelled to go further</v>

346
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.064
<v Speaker 3>than the statement that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's certainly one of my </v>

347
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the greatest of mysteries.</v>

348
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 3>We are part of the greatest mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for me that's enough.</v>

349
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

350
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.233
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a very beautiful humility in </v>

351
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:32.454
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

352
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.633
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful because what I was gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>say is that like that all I do have </v>

353
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.633
<v Speaker 2>faith and if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have to sort of unpack it and I'll </v>

354
00:18:43.241 --> 00:18:46.150
<v Speaker 2>move for us to continue our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

355
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:46.984
<v Speaker 2>What I'm fascinated by perennialism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns that are found consistently </v>

356
00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:51.184
<v Speaker 2>throughout human mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're dislocated geographically that </v>

357
00:18:53.441 --> 00:18:54.274
<v Speaker 2>seemed to have universal themes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and that I later discovered to </v>

358
00:18:56.801 --> 00:19:01.450
<v Speaker 2>have relationships that can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree be described by science,</v>

359
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:03.370
<v Speaker 2>by the language of science and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit of science,</v>

360
00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:06.250
<v Speaker 2>particularly as you describe it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a,</v>

361
00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:07.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would I say?</v>

362
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Spirit of love egg for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was curious to me that oppenheimer as</v>

363
00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:13.744
<v Speaker 2>I understand and can remember I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous territory and anytime I step </v>

364
00:19:16.601 --> 00:19:19.400
<v Speaker 2>towards science review and never cited </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me like the [inaudible],</v>

365
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I think he quoted the back of our gator </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the point that the,</v>

366
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the of those tests,</v>

367
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 2>those nuclear tests and indeed buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 2>attacks is it.</v>

369
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I am become death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The destroyer of worlds.</v>

370
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

371
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And for me that there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that they're in like,</v>

372
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing I can't get my head </v>

373
00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 2>around and this is gcse stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that campaign within the,</v>

374
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.430
<v Speaker 2>as it was then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.443
<v Speaker 2>one of the smallest components of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical reality with the capacity for </v>

376
00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:47.134
<v Speaker 2>such enormous destruction that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inconceivable energy with health like </v>

377
00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:51.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like that one there.</v>

378
00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:51.964
<v Speaker 2>The reason is I'm curious about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are influences in </v>

379
00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:59.170
<v Speaker 2>religious scripture that seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to describe that,</v>

380
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:03.190
<v Speaker 2>that within the infantile and Somali </v>
<v Speaker 2>small there is great power that there is</v>

381
00:20:03.191 --> 00:20:04.024
<v Speaker 2>limitless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all things were endowed with </v>

382
00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:05.794
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the sort of like when I </v>

383
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 2>approach religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't sort of pick one particular book</v>

384
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and God right on with these guys and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who's not with it,</v>

385
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see them killed.</v>

386
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Luckily it's much more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

387
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 2>they seem to be describing stuff without</v>
<v Speaker 2>the language,</v>

388
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:19.834
<v Speaker 2>without the language or the capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very sort of somewhat trite example </v>

389
00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:25.810
<v Speaker 2>when dealing with her mind such as yours</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the,</v>

390
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recent discovery of the benefits of </v>

391
00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:32.230
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness and meditation for Millennia</v>

392
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.123
<v Speaker 2>have been spoken of as valuable for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human condition to have an access to an </v>

393
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:36.634
<v Speaker 2>aspect of your own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely not about rationalism </v>

394
00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:39.634
<v Speaker 2>and materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about access to perhaps the </v>

395
00:20:41.201 --> 00:20:44.770
<v Speaker 2>systems that very kindly run your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kidneys for you and all of that.</v>

396
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>And so when that's discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrable,</v>

397
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.160
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

398
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.673
<v Speaker 3>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes popularized or underwritten </v>

399
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.633
<v Speaker 3>by dogma excellence at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were communities and </v>

400
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:57.844
<v Speaker 3>ideologies that knew that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies were powerful without the </v>

401
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:03.364
<v Speaker 3>apparatus we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think contained throughout </v>

402
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 3>scripture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talking about oneness,</v>

403
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.800
<v Speaker 3>unity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for nature,</v>

404
00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 3>the nature of the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nature of consciousness.</v>

405
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 3>And it's only from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

406
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:14.914
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>background or religious background is </v>

407
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 3>only when it becomes doctrinal or people</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

408
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 3>this is definitely the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

409
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.780
<v Speaker 3>That it becomes problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

410
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

411
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would say that I don't think the,</v>

412
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I think the way to access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

413
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 3>the way to build models about the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nature works is to observe nature,</v>

414
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.053
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is essentially the scientific </v>

415
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 3>method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You observed nature,</v>

416
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 3>you come up with some model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you test it,</v>

417
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 3>and if it doesn't agree with what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

418
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 3>then it's wrong when you throw it away </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you that.</v>

419
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.563
<v Speaker 3>So I suppose really if you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the human condition for many thousands </v>

420
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 3>of years from the time when we first had</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a thing,</v>

421
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.913
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a responds to nature to everything </v>

422
00:21:57.611 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 3>about being human is about responding to</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

423
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.490
<v Speaker 3>So I would be surprised if if people </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't in that,</v>

424
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.740
<v Speaker 3>in those responses that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

425
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:09.603
<v Speaker 3>didn't observe things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns and discover things that you </v>

426
00:22:12.741 --> 00:22:13.574
<v Speaker 3>know you don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need modern science to allow </v>

427
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:16.924
<v Speaker 3>you to discover the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a regularity in the passage of </v>

428
00:22:19.241 --> 00:22:20.370
<v Speaker 3>the seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

429
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 3>because you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's most of what it means to be human.</v>

430
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not surprised that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also as you say,</v>

431
00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 3>in terms of how to exist as as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a human being,</v>

432
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.660
<v Speaker 3>than the scientists not going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that actually it can tell you,</v>

433
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.863
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be better review a little bit </v>

434
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:43.801
<v Speaker 3>less fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to tell you about how</v>

435
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 3>to be content and happy.</v>

436
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 3>What would it does is I think provides a</v>
<v Speaker 3>framework of.</v>

437
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the word truth,</v>

438
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.400
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to get at because we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

439
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:02.670
<v Speaker 3>We can always discover things a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way,</v>

440
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 3>but it provides you a framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

441
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:05.831
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

442
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:06.664
<v Speaker 3>the earth goes around the sun now and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>tells us that there are a hundred </v>

443
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 3>billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

444
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 3>That's one of 2 trillion galaxies in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>observable universe getting heavy now,</v>

445
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>but that's challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

446
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:19.911
<v Speaker 3>But then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

447
00:23:19.911 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we to make of that humility.</v>

448
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.323
<v Speaker 3>Let listeners and and I think that's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most interesting things that we </v>

449
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.614
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We discovered that we are at it </v>

450
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 3>physically and insignificant speck in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>

451
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.644
<v Speaker 3>so you can't argue with otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are 2 trillion galaxies in a bit </v>

452
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:36.154
<v Speaker 3>we can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time there's the idea </v>

453
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:40.834
<v Speaker 3>that consciousness at contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 3>atoms might be very rare and therefore </v>

454
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 3>we can be valuable and insignificant at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

455
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.030
<v Speaker 3>And this is what Oppenheimer meant by </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

456
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.903
<v Speaker 3>In his lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoke about them not on the podcast </v>

457
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.234
<v Speaker 3>actually running this show earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he talks about an idea called </v>

458
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.120
<v Speaker 3>complementarity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which comes from.</v>

459
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 3>It came from the early quantum mechanics</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

460
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.260
<v Speaker 3>People are Niels Bohr and others and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually,</v>

461
00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:09.094
<v Speaker 3>it comes from eastern philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this idea that you have to hold </v>

462
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.513
<v Speaker 3>mutually contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently mutually contradictory ideas </v>

463
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:17.414
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to in order to get a full </v>

464
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.474
<v Speaker 3>picture of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's true in interpreting quantum </v>

465
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:24.824
<v Speaker 3>mechanics and what he said is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've already referred to is that </v>

466
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.670
<v Speaker 3>people have known this for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you.</v>

467
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.523
<v Speaker 3>You also have to do it to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human condition run society and it's a </v>

468
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 3>very good example of how science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper philosophical thinking.</v>

469
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Intersex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

470
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

471
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.313
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating and beautiful because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose what's implicit in that are </v>

472
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 2>quite fundamental ideas around </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectivity and subjectivity.</v>

473
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.183
<v Speaker 2>The inner and outer world and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they relate and the a is out out </v>

474
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.560
<v Speaker 2>our tendency to regard that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

475
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.343
<v Speaker 2>from an individualistic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Po lead potentially to quite a lot of </v>

476
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.603
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'm very curious </v>

477
00:25:07.801 --> 00:25:08.634
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that your rationalism reason </v>

478
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.880
<v Speaker 2>and what's demonstrable is hugely </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant and important,</v>

479
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.953
<v Speaker 2>but what fascinates me is that it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that certainly in earlier times people </v>

480
00:25:19.711 --> 00:25:20.544
<v Speaker 2>were relating to their own consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ways that somewhat define our </v>

481
00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:25.014
<v Speaker 2>rational understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were having sort of yoga </v>

482
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 2>meditative trips and now people like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

483
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.683
<v Speaker 2>for ios going pio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting romantic plants that people </v>

484
00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:34.554
<v Speaker 2>have always used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have different experiences within </v>

485
00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:37.164
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that tackle this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that you're saying science deals </v>

486
00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 2>with now imperiously and rationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessarily,</v>

487
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that there might be other </v>
<v Speaker 2>avenues to know.</v>

488
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.033
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be reluctant to use a word as </v>

489
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:50.754
<v Speaker 2>absolute truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are different avenues to </v>

490
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.573
<v Speaker 2>understanding different avenues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>incite fascinates me with the </v>

491
00:25:57.331 --> 00:25:59.610
<v Speaker 2>construction of mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you said,</v>

492
00:25:59.611 --> 00:26:02.010
<v Speaker 2>man is continually relating to his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

493
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.290
<v Speaker 2>shaping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped by his environment.</v>

494
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.920
<v Speaker 2>The basis of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

495
00:26:05.921 --> 00:26:06.754
<v Speaker 2>one of the bases I'm sure over evolution</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the way that we relate to </v>

496
00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:09.714
<v Speaker 2>external conditions and of course those </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions very and for political </v>

497
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.640
<v Speaker 2>couches that were early adopters of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture,</v>

498
00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:18.474
<v Speaker 2>have myths that demonstrate that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>God to sacrificed and put in the ground </v>

499
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.850
<v Speaker 2>and hunt SSR is as tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualistic.</v>

500
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.080
<v Speaker 2>They know the myths evolve to represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural circumstance,</v>

501
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.840
<v Speaker 2>demonstrable demonstratively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm interested in,</v>

502
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>

503
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.373
<v Speaker 2>is how can we use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've just touched upon with that </v>

504
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.990
<v Speaker 2>idea that opened said that itself echoed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual,</v>

505
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.753
<v Speaker 2>how can we use what we learn in science </v>
<v Speaker 2>to inform our societies in bloody </v>

506
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 2>difficult times politically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>globally?</v>

507
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 2>What values can we extract?</v>

508
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.233
<v Speaker 3>I'll answer that and then going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to something you said we should </v>

509
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.131
<v Speaker 3>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Routes to.</v>

510
00:26:58.131 --> 00:26:58.964
<v Speaker 3>Insight for thought was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting because the answer that </v>

511
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 3>question directly is that oftentime </v>
<v Speaker 3>appointed.</v>

512
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I said it'd be think about political </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

513
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.800
<v Speaker 3>the way that we organize our society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might think that they're mutually</v>

514
00:27:09.801 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 3>contradictory axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>

515
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:14.060
<v Speaker 3>one could be a freedom of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

516
00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:16.820
<v Speaker 3>If you're a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme libertarian,</v>

517
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.803
<v Speaker 3>you think that individual freedom is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most important thing and you might be </v>

518
00:27:21.081 --> 00:27:24.800
<v Speaker 3>prepared to compromise a bit and build </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in of have a society with.</v>

519
00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately you're talking about freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the base,</v>

520
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas if you're on the,</v>

521
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.170
<v Speaker 3>if you're a communist or further to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

522
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:34.004
<v Speaker 3>you might be thinking that society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that matters and you might </v>

523
00:27:36.771 --> 00:27:40.040
<v Speaker 3>reluctantly build a bit of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom in and will often.</v>

524
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.873
<v Speaker 3>Jaime was saying when this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complementarity is the two ideas of </v>

525
00:27:43.971 --> 00:27:47.630
<v Speaker 3>freedom and society are inextricably </v>
<v Speaker 3>linked,</v>

526
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.870
<v Speaker 3>they feed off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are both necessary for deal.</v>

527
00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:51.704
<v Speaker 3>That's who exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can't have freedom without a </v>

528
00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:54.434
<v Speaker 3>society and you can't have a society </v>
<v Speaker 3>without freedom and it's just the idea </v>

529
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.660
<v Speaker 3>that you don't start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

530
00:28:01.661 --> 00:28:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a Marxist,</v>

531
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.853
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

532
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.873
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>society and its interaction with </v>

533
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.970
<v Speaker 3>individualities very complicated and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to.</v>

534
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.863
<v Speaker 3>You need to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to be comfortable with holding </v>

535
00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:18.104
<v Speaker 3>those two ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We called them orthogonal in physics at </v>

536
00:28:19.971 --> 00:28:22.250
<v Speaker 3>right angles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mutually contradictory ideas.</v>

537
00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing a little as good,</v>

538
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:24.643
<v Speaker 3>orthogonal 90 degrees to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to hold both of them in your </v>

539
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:31.940
<v Speaker 3>head and be comfortable and understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you need them both to get a full</v>

540
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.770
<v Speaker 2>sure thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antithesis,</v>

541
00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:36.320
<v Speaker 2>synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another spiritual ideas</v>

542
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.340
<v Speaker 3>contradictory and you have to do it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in understanding quantum mechanics,</v>

543
00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:44.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's the great thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature forces you to think like that,</v>

544
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 3>so it's no longer optional animas key </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

545
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.490
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're trained,</v>

546
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you're forced to think in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's very valuable.</v>

547
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also say Brian,</v>

548
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.283
<v Speaker 2>that the way that semantics and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems of taxonomy actually operate is </v>

549
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:07.210
<v Speaker 2>a word like freedom is determined by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

550
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.020
<v Speaker 2>So freedom ultimately becomes in where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say in our society,</v>

551
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.610
<v Speaker 2>freedom within limits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ultimately freedom to consume,</v>

552
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.840
<v Speaker 2>freedom to behave in accordance with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideologies.</v>

553
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:20.674
<v Speaker 2>This is what freedom means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When political figures talk about they </v>

554
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:25.580
<v Speaker 2>hate our freedoms or they're attacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>our freedoms,</v>

555
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:26.643
<v Speaker 2>wha wha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they mean by freedom is often </v>

556
00:29:28.091 --> 00:29:33.091
<v Speaker 2>indicated by the maxims they spout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in crises,</v>

557
00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:34.564
<v Speaker 2>Eg go out and shop after nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>or there is no such thing as society </v>

558
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:41.703
<v Speaker 2>from Margaret Thatcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These like these sort of a momentary </v>

559
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 2>fishes with ever fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we can glance what they mean.</v>

560
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 2>What is the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it,</v>

561
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.313
<v Speaker 2>what is their truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like we were discussing earlier </v>

562
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>in my summer intentionally to aft radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

563
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

564
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 2>um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

565
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what I was saying there.</v>

566
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was operating on a level that was.</v>

567
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you said that you've given examples</v>

568
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:13.070
<v Speaker 3>of people who are convinced that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are right now is the point.</v>

569
00:30:13.071 --> 00:30:13.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainty.</v>

570
00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You said beware of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>served and I think that,</v>

571
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:17.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really,</v>

572
00:30:17.841 --> 00:30:19.940
<v Speaker 3>if you think about what a free society </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

573
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.350
<v Speaker 3>that it means that there's a spectrum of</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoints on every issue.</v>

574
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:25.543
<v Speaker 3>And so you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd call it a distribution with the </v>

575
00:30:28.251 --> 00:30:30.560
<v Speaker 3>mathematics recall the tails of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution,</v>

576
00:30:30.561 --> 00:30:31.394
<v Speaker 3>which are the bits at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most people might believe this stuff </v>

577
00:30:33.471 --> 00:30:35.840
<v Speaker 3>in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are people on either side that</v>

578
00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:38.660
<v Speaker 3>believe other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have to,</v>

579
00:30:38.661 --> 00:30:39.494
<v Speaker 3>by definition in a free society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find yourself occasionally at odds with </v>

580
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:45.290
<v Speaker 3>the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a signal that you live in a free</v>

581
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:46.124
<v Speaker 3>society and you should celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the key lesson for me </v>

582
00:30:50.301 --> 00:30:51.134
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from just thinking rather more </v>

583
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.943
<v Speaker 3>scientifically about things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that is to understand that when you </v>

584
00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:58.910
<v Speaker 3>find yourselves in disagreement with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>

585
00:30:59.150 --> 00:30:59.670
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

586
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:00.503
<v Speaker 3>It is a signal of a healthy democracy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a healthy society and you should </v>

587
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:07.400
<v Speaker 3>celebrate every time you find you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlier.</v>

588
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.790
<v Speaker 3>You should be waving a flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be running down the street</v>

589
00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:13.160
<v Speaker 3>cheering going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't live in North Korea.</v>

590
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.040
<v Speaker 3>That's what you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that has been lost.</v>

591
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:16.874
<v Speaker 3>You do live in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which case don't run down the flag if </v>

592
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should not create.</v>

593
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.420
<v Speaker 3>But I think we've lost that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see on Yammer,</v>

594
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.263
<v Speaker 3>we both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're both on twitter and we see that </v>

595
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.540
<v Speaker 3>the polarization of debates means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just not thinking.</v>

596
00:31:32.541 --> 00:31:33.374
<v Speaker 3>They're not stopping and thinking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that this person is saying </v>

597
00:31:36.201 --> 00:31:40.580
<v Speaker 3>something with which I disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>signals to me that our societies healthy</v>

598
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.623
<v Speaker 3>and the moment that nobody's saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I disagree with is the </v>

599
00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:48.410
<v Speaker 3>moment you should actually then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should leave the country and run.</v>

600
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.553
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnessing now is the time of </v>

601
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.603
<v Speaker 2>foreclosure around discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that more and more things are becoming </v>

602
00:31:56.401 --> 00:31:57.234
<v Speaker 2>to booth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a reemergence of censure </v>

603
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.670
<v Speaker 2>and the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you just indicated,</v>

604
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.980
<v Speaker 2>is a very good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the things that are unsayable.</v>

605
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that the art,</v>

606
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.780
<v Speaker 2>we have to say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies.</v>

607
00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Ideals are being said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is such a thing as power.</v>

608
00:32:12.811 --> 00:32:13.644
<v Speaker 2>We're not living in a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly fluctuating and according to </v>

609
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:17.124
<v Speaker 2>the will of the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were living in a democracy where the </v>

610
00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:20.034
<v Speaker 2>function of democracy is to limit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity of people to impact its </v>

611
00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:24.624
<v Speaker 2>objectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one of the problems of </v>

612
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>globalization is that it has meant the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a.</v>

613
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.740
<v Speaker 2>they're not subject to sort of national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of a regional law by.</v>

614
00:32:34.351 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 2>They seem to live in a kind of what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

615
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.300
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a rarefied protected space</v>

616
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 3>that and what you've seen with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brexit votes and I,</v>

617
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:46.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's the right route at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

618
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:46.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

619
00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm a great fan of the European </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union.</v>

620
00:32:50.671 --> 00:32:53.670
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've seen with the brexit vote is</v>

621
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Speaker 3>extremely positive in the sense you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking because what you've seen is a,</v>

622
00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.053
<v Speaker 3>a statement by the majority of people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country that they reject the status </v>

623
00:33:02.341 --> 00:33:03.174
<v Speaker 3>quo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

624
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.750
<v Speaker 3>And I think they have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have rejected the status quo.</v>

625
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.803
<v Speaker 3>A prime minister resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's now a absolute flux in politics </v>

626
00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that we.</v>

627
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to note two things here.</v>

628
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a massive anomaly.</v>

629
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen very often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like brexit.</v>

630
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:23.050
<v Speaker 2>That's why everyone's wearing themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all giggly and excited about that.</v>

631
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Brexit in itself was an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction or rational reaction.</v>

632
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 2>People won't go more because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see these trade laws or emotions,</v>

633
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 3>but it showed you that the status quo </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be overturned in a democracy because</v>

634
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:37.170
<v Speaker 3>at the moment we don't have this.</v>

635
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I would say within certain guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

636
00:33:40.361 --> 00:33:41.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when's the vote for now we're going to </v>

637
00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>tax corporations at this rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to,</v>

638
00:33:44.321 --> 00:33:44.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

639
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.160
<v Speaker 2>this is how we want to pay mortgages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how we want our societies.</v>

640
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.820
<v Speaker 3>You can argue that it may be that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

641
00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.100
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister,</v>

642
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:59.110
<v Speaker 3>which would have been absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unthinkable and two years ago,</v>

643
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.130
<v Speaker 3>and if he does become prime industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be as a result of the brexit vote,</v>

644
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:08.310
<v Speaker 3>that that will be the route that a more </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical politician managed it.</v>

645
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.560
<v Speaker 3>That's how a radical politician will </v>
<v Speaker 3>have got into number 10.</v>

646
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

647
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

648
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

649
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I think brexit is a mistake because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that it,</v>

650
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.480
<v Speaker 3>that the people that voted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.563
<v Speaker 3>to challenge the status quo are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer the most from this and the </v>

652
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.970
<v Speaker 3>removal of the freedoms that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move around Europe.</v>

653
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.873
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the removable of access to single </v>

654
00:34:30.011 --> 00:34:30.671
<v Speaker 3>market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>

655
00:34:30.671 --> 00:34:32.920
<v Speaker 3>so I think actually it's the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

656
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:33.993
<v Speaker 3>Possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they are interested in </v>

657
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.460
<v Speaker 3>democratically that it can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can</v>

658
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:39.403
<v Speaker 2>still happen unless it does lead to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>left wing government who use it as an </v>

659
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:42.404
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to create new legislation </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the behavior of transnational </v>

660
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:46.930
<v Speaker 2>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different taxation or something.</v>

661
00:34:46.931 --> 00:34:47.764
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there is.</v>

662
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to someone in here </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently about like a possible left wing</v>

663
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.470
<v Speaker 2>outcome for Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

664
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.313
<v Speaker 2>We dragged down at bloody brexit </v>
<v Speaker 2>quagmire when a man who understands the </v>

665
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 2>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't plan to talk about that,</v>

666
00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a good demonstration</v>

667
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.153
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about it you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>see as a healthy attack on the status </v>

668
00:35:05.761 --> 00:35:06.411
<v Speaker 3>quo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>

669
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it'll have that result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

670
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:09.583
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that it's an anomaly is </v>

671
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:16.040
<v Speaker 2>what concerns me and the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower the threshold of what's acceptable</v>

672
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 2>for democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got democracy once in a while.</v>

673
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:22.340
<v Speaker 2>We can have a Miss God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Misguided carnival of disruption instead</v>

674
00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:23.174
<v Speaker 2>of democracy is why don't we control our</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities and controlled so that the </v>

675
00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:30.710
<v Speaker 2>most vulnerable people have access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

676
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 2>That's democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not,</v>

677
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:33.284
<v Speaker 2>that is not democracy is a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater and like I don't settle for </v>

678
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:38.080
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember like</v>

679
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 1>because of you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about because you</v>

680
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:41.634
<v Speaker 1>were very keen to encourage young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a point where I was saying it's </v>

681
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 1>pointless and like it was a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intern because I,</v>

682
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I sense that you and I have a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>in common ideologically.</v>

683
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:51.744
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the separation even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a scientist and I'm a religious </v>

684
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:55.164
<v Speaker 1>maniac and you often pro democracy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud mass decentralization and </v>

685
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of power where possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.993
<v Speaker 1>but I feel that we're both driven by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that we're essentially optimistic </v>

687
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 1>is what I would say about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem like an optimistic man.</v>

688
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be.</v>

689
00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Because we go back to what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier about the value of</v>

690
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 1>this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth and I think one of the.</v>

691
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 1>If I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one message that I would like</v>

692
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:23.994
<v Speaker 1>people to take away from anything that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is to is to value this place and </v>

693
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:27.770
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

694
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 1>That's not some kind of like a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippy type thing.</v>

695
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Is it just based on the observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

696
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

697
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.940
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of life on earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may well be.</v>

698
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It may make us quite a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can be unique in a galaxy,</v>

699
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

700
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there'll be other civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there in the billions of galaxies in</v>

701
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be that the average is that</v>

702
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 1>there's about roughly one civilizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>per galaxy at any one time,</v>

703
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.103
<v Speaker 1>and imagine that Arthur c Clarke once </v>
<v Speaker 1>famously said that there are two </v>

704
00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either we are alone or we're not in both</v>

705
00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:04.784
<v Speaker 1>a terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need to proceed on the </v>

706
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 1>basis that we are now an imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people thought about that,</v>

707
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.073
<v Speaker 1>which is just a matter of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people thought actually that if we </v>

708
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.663
<v Speaker 1>decided to have a nuclear war tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally perhaps and destroyed </v>

709
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.200
<v Speaker 1>intelligent life on the planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be that we destroy meaning in the</v>

710
00:37:27.301 --> 00:37:32.110
<v Speaker 1>galaxy and meaning I use advisedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about it,</v>

711
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 1>meaning obviously exists in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means something to us,</v>

712
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
<v Speaker 1>so there are collections of atoms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow of of the property of meaning as</v>

713
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:42.900
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>

714
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It means something to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go,</v>

715
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.790
<v Speaker 1>then there will be no meaning in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner of the university.</v>

716
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is local and it's temporary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think accepting that but by which I </v>

717
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:54.954
<v Speaker 1>mean it it had in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I say I think it's global way </v>

718
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.493
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way it's irrelevant whether there </v>

719
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 1>are other civilizations or this one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique in empirically.</v>

720
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's up to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

721
00:38:05.171 --> 00:38:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even life is beautiful.</v>

722
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.733
<v Speaker 1>Life is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not someone's over there </v>

723
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:09.864
<v Speaker 1>having a beautiful time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me sort of irrelevant and also terms </v>

724
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.943
<v Speaker 1>such as local and ton portal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a highly subjective terms as we have </v>

725
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:17.964
<v Speaker 1>already established that refer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns themselves that exist within a </v>

726
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>context and our consciousness relates </v>
<v Speaker 1>only to that context,</v>

727
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 1>so the meaning that emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like,</v>

728
00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:28.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever this thing is that transition </v>

729
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 1>from online to live for various </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradients,</v>

730
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:33.594
<v Speaker 1>geological to biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever proceeded and whatever follows </v>

731
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that meaning is one of its components.</v>

732
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It exists as organically as trees.</v>

733
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well physicists are.</v>

734
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Some scientists refer to as an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>property which is something that emerges</v>

735
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:51.424
<v Speaker 1>from some more fundamental structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is probably the difference </v>

736
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:54.814
<v Speaker 1>between us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ask you a question because because I </v>

737
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:57.304
<v Speaker 1>think that the great challenge of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence is to come to terms with the </v>

738
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 1>fact that the meaning exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

739
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.793
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's local in the sense that it's not </v>

740
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 1>universal and I think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

741
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.014
<v Speaker 1>If I was to define the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a religious person or a non </v>

742
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.430
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's a question to you,</v>

743
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that religion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching for global meaning and I think</v>

744
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:20.494
<v Speaker 1>it's local and I think there will come a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the life of the universe when </v>

745
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:24.184
<v Speaker 1>there is no meaning left because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as far as they were approaching it </v>

746
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 1>won't mean.</v>

747
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I think though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my truck.</v>

748
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:30.184
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>material materialism and rationalism </v>

749
00:39:32.911 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 1>lead to individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and consumerism.</v>

750
00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:39.490
<v Speaker 1>We can see in real time what it leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically and socially.</v>

751
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:40.324
<v Speaker 1>I mean more brutal than that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the in the far future of the </v>

752
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There won't be any sons left shining,</v>

753
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.940
<v Speaker 1>so there won't be any atoms that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate at of course the universe.</v>

754
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I understand that and that is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous thing to say,</v>

755
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Brian and and I've got absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody kit to argue with prince.</v>

756
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.670
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually graduate.</v>

757
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 1>What does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you feel like?</v>

758
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:05.041
<v Speaker 1>If I say there will come a time in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future when there is no consciousness in</v>

759
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 1>the universe and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all possibility of meaning has gone,</v>

760
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.080
<v Speaker 1>but the universe will still be there.</v>

761
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.063
<v Speaker 1>I would say that within my philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and matter have the </v>

762
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 1>reverse relationship too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In yours.</v>

763
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I believe that emerges from </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

764
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:24.603
<v Speaker 1>not vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even where the astrophysical context </v>

765
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.170
<v Speaker 1>or in evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

766
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.940
<v Speaker 1>brilliant men such as yourself and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessors have demonstrated that will</v>

767
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:34.774
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me is essentially irrelevant </v>

768
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.210
<v Speaker 1>because it's just part of the cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballet.</v>

769
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Continuing within the framework of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

770
00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and I underwrite this of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculative lake,</v>

771
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.943
<v Speaker 1>like all theories that are that bookend </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation it speculative as anybody </v>

772
00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:56.020
<v Speaker 1>else's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me in the proceeding,</v>

773
00:40:56.021 --> 00:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>the Big Bang there is consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that is not individualized</v>

774
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:00.904
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no expressed through matter and </v>

775
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:03.214
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrativize or used to underwrite or </v>

776
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:06.634
<v Speaker 1>support any particular ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like in our consciousness for </v>

777
00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:11.710
<v Speaker 1>white people or a consciousness for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>

778
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.860
<v Speaker 1>pure consciousness expressing itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Mata and that these patterns and</v>

779
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 1>habits that are so beautifully </v>
<v Speaker 1>delineated,</v>

780
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:20.494
<v Speaker 1>these rules that discovered with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that Herman Melville describes as </v>

781
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.753
<v Speaker 1>all human sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but passing fables as we discover what </v>

782
00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:29.134
<v Speaker 1>lies beyond them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these are an expression of this </v>

783
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when eventually whatever</v>

784
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it is that exist instead of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>are consumed by the sun,</v>

785
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't matter to me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuation I believe is temporal.</v>

786
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.670
<v Speaker 2>The I am just part of a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness temporarily occupying this</v>

787
00:41:45.671 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 2>individual or I can't put it any better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Bill Hicks.</v>

788
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 2>We are one consciousness experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself subjectively and I would say that</v>

789
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>the reason that geology becomes biology </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because the geology is conscious.</v>

790
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.470
<v Speaker 2>That consciousness is in all things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that we should love nature.</v>

791
00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:02.304
<v Speaker 2>I love the earth and love one another is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we are all one and there are </v>

792
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 2>motifs for this through our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we moved by heroism?</v>

793
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Because a person's sacrificing </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves for another why?</v>

794
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:14.324
<v Speaker 2>Because they know inadvertent commerce </v>
<v Speaker 2>on some deeper level that there is no </v>

795
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 2>distinction between self and other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is mainly the greed of the senses,</v>

796
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 2>dealing with physical information.</v>

797
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 2>The experience are receives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is inside,</v>

798
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.213
<v Speaker 2>this is outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately in essentially those </v>

799
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 2>distinctions are animalistic attempts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand limitless phenomena.</v>

800
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I would say like you,</v>

801
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 2>we have to regard these thing with love </v>
<v Speaker 2>because love in a very Christian sense,</v>

802
00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 2>actually let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cs Lewis says,</v>

803
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.553
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're rewarded when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do a good thing and when you do a bad </v>

804
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that was bad,</v>

805
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 2>so let's just go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be kind to one another.</v>

806
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:53.324
<v Speaker 2>Love one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let people believe what they want to </v>

807
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:55.990
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mine comes from that.</v>

808
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.133
<v Speaker 2>I'm not ashamed of the bits that sounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit hippy because for me love is an </v>

809
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love is a force,</v>

810
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:03.710
<v Speaker 2>and whilst it's difficult to quantify </v>
<v Speaker 2>and measure without it,</v>

811
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:04.544
<v Speaker 2>we are nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

812
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.660
<v Speaker 3>the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my view is it certainly bleaker,</v>

813
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pointing,</v>

814
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that actually the road see,</v>

815
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.983
<v Speaker 3>I would say that the road to wisdom is </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the most challenging question that I </v>

816
00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:24.934
<v Speaker 3>face given the I'm saying that matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>and energy in the laws of nature exist </v>

817
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.843
<v Speaker 3>and then life emerges from them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will come and sign when there's no </v>

818
00:43:34.241 --> 00:43:39.241
<v Speaker 3>life so that that challenges you to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the value then of life and given</v>

819
00:43:40.841 --> 00:43:45.841
<v Speaker 3>that it is temporary and this emerges </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it will go away again and it will be</v>

820
00:43:45.911 --> 00:43:50.911
<v Speaker 3>time when the universe is dark and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nothing left and I think that you get</v>

821
00:43:50.951 --> 00:43:51.784
<v Speaker 3>some sort of delight from what I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think in the sense that the </v>

822
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.063
<v Speaker 3>the piece is a human being I think comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>from finding your accommodation with </v>

823
00:44:05.411 --> 00:44:10.411
<v Speaker 3>your temporary existence and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning that it's so.</v>

824
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.283
<v Speaker 3>The temporary nature of it to me makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it more valuable is a fine as a tiny </v>

825
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:19.630
<v Speaker 3>amount of time is nothing in the light </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe.</v>

826
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:20.683
<v Speaker 3>A tiny amount of time when we not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>individually but as a human race can </v>

827
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:25.564
<v Speaker 3>exist and explore and love the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a finite tiny amount of time and I </v>

828
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>think</v>

829
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodation to come to it,</v>

830
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.093
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what reality is and so </v>

831
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>we've got to come to accommodation with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think in that accommodation is the</v>

832
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:46.074
<v Speaker 1>way you learn to love the planets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people on it because you learned </v>

833
00:44:49.371 --> 00:44:51.280
<v Speaker 1>that they are temporary and valuable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise.</v>

834
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 1>As long as it leads to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of doesn't really matter.</v>

835
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.480
<v Speaker 1>But what we'll say is we've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already acknowledged in the,</v>

836
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:57.683
<v Speaker 1>in this brief interview that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the temporal framework </v>

837
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and the spatial framework of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking down the more we examined them,</v>

838
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:06.203
<v Speaker 1>so why would we continue to use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework to conjecture billions of </v>

839
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 1>years in the future when it's breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>

840
00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we do it by the way,</v>

841
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 1>is to get to say it's a thing called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom in equation,</v>

842
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 1>which comes from general relativity from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's theory Republican in Nineteen</v>

843
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:21.804
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

844
00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.773
<v Speaker 1>And what Einstein's theory tells us is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a a given thing which is </v>

845
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called space time.</v>

846
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So there's a thing and it doesn't tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you where it came from,</v>

847
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:33.324
<v Speaker 1>it tells you there is such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does tell you how that thing </v>

848
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:37.404
<v Speaker 1>stretches and warps and deforms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in response to the matter and </v>

849
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:43.860
<v Speaker 1>energy that are present in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

850
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:44.903
<v Speaker 1>So you can calculate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given this amount of matter in this </v>

851
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:51.170
<v Speaker 1>amount of radiation and dark matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark energy.</v>

852
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Now I've given all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

853
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.113
<v Speaker 1>what will it do in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the response of the fabric of </v>

854
00:45:56.461 --> 00:45:57.294
<v Speaker 1>the universe to this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what enables us to say with </v>

855
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.670
<v Speaker 1>some confidence that unless the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics that we don't understand it,</v>

856
00:46:03.671 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 1>there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but given what we know now,</v>

857
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 1>the university is accelerating in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion,</v>

858
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 1>which we observe and he will come to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where we think it will just double</v>

859
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 1>continually in size every 20 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or so forever.</v>

860
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And we can make that prediction given </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know now.</v>

861
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.963
<v Speaker 1>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the baseline sort of baseline </v>

862
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:23.634
<v Speaker 1>prediction is we are in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will end up in what's called an </v>

863
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:26.874
<v Speaker 1>exponential expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubling in size every 20 billion years </v>

864
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:34.191
<v Speaker 1>or so for ever because life cannot exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely in such a universe,</v>

865
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.903
<v Speaker 1>of course not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not necessarily a linear </v>

866
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And reality may be fractal,</v>

867
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.303
<v Speaker 1>maybe spiral right at the basis of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Theorem is the acceptance and we don't </v>

868
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:45.534
<v Speaker 1>know where it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's going and it infers that </v>

869
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:48.151
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:51.550
<v Speaker 1>as I know you've talked about a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your programs is expanding into apparent</v>

871
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 1>nothingness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you see that our linguistic and</v>

872
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:55.524
<v Speaker 1>indeed psychological tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological thoughts I would imagine </v>

873
00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>from your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to break down.</v>

874
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And so this is again where I sort of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>invite sort of faith say one thing.</v>

875
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.153
<v Speaker 1>It is a theory that is tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is the theory that allows us to </v>

876
00:47:10.471 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

877
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:12.144
<v Speaker 1>the satellite navigation system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quite I'm not having a go at bloody </v>

878
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Einstein or satellite navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does work within,</v>

879
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:20.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's a model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

880
00:47:20.121 --> 00:47:20.954
<v Speaker 1>But Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say satellite navigation </v>

881
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 1>systems are fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic,</v>

882
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:24.684
<v Speaker 1>though they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not tools that we're going to </v>

883
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 1>use to measure the expanse of a dabbling</v>

884
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.023
<v Speaker 2>in millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a localized bit of information </v>

885
00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.380
<v Speaker 2>that applies to us as corn or beans.</v>

886
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Just a quick explanation of how we know </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's expanding.</v>

887
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.753
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is is simple observation that if you </v>

888
00:47:43.891 --> 00:47:44.724
<v Speaker 3>look at the light from a distant galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you find that it stretched so </v>

889
00:47:48.331 --> 00:47:50.970
<v Speaker 3>quite literally mean the color changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called red shift.</v>

890
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's a lie as a wavelength and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>long wave.</v>

891
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 3>So rather than the short wave lengths </v>
<v Speaker 3>are blue and what you find is light that</v>

892
00:47:56.851 --> 00:47:57.684
<v Speaker 3>should have been blue because you see it</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from a particular kind of answer </v>

893
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.773
<v Speaker 3>in that galaxy is actually now red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the explanation is that space has </v>

894
00:48:04.591 --> 00:48:07.350
<v Speaker 3>been stretching during the time the </v>
<v Speaker 3>light has been traveling.</v>

895
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And what you find is the further the </v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxy is away,</v>

896
00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.030
<v Speaker 3>the more delight you're stretched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should exactly what you'd expect.</v>

897
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.873
<v Speaker 3>If you live in an expanding universe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>by making those measurements she can </v>

898
00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:17.484
<v Speaker 3>measure how fast the universe has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding over billions of years and </v>

899
00:48:20.371 --> 00:48:21.204
<v Speaker 3>then this is a sim,</v>

900
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:23.663
<v Speaker 2>no one could refute it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely beautiful and I only I know </v>

901
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:26.944
<v Speaker 2>that already and the reason I know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is because I've watched you explain </v>

902
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 2>it elegantly and in a way that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to me and is meaningful to me,</v>

903
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.340
<v Speaker 2>but what I would add to that is we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>red,</v>

904
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.313
<v Speaker 2>we see blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We somehow within our minds experience </v>

905
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we experienced blue,</v>

906
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 2>we have eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have senses.</v>

907
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:46.534
<v Speaker 2>We live in this realm where something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing something and like you </v>

908
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atoms experiencing other atoms.</v>

909
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:53.854
<v Speaker 2>Now what we have to continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledges that there is a finite </v>

910
00:48:56.831 --> 00:48:57.664
<v Speaker 2>ability to understand information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is evidently limitless </v>

911
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:00.964
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point we're going to hit a wall </v>

912
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.083
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue the war and what exists beyond </v>

913
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his theories,</v>

914
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.060
<v Speaker 2>conjecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>

915
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's curious to me that is steeped </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our theological history.</v>

916
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:17.800
<v Speaker 2>There were people speculating in similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and reaching similar conclusions.</v>

917
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can accurately say that's because</v>

918
00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:22.054
<v Speaker 2>space is stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you experienced read is different </v>

919
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:24.424
<v Speaker 2>because why you've traveled different </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the different density of spite and </v>

920
00:49:25.931 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 2>people aren't saying stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are speculating and trying to</v>

921
00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:33.730
<v Speaker 2>understand the phenomena of </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitlessness</v>

922
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.710
<v Speaker 3>reminded me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

923
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.800
<v Speaker 3>and you remind about something you said </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier site which is this,</v>

924
00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:40.790
<v Speaker 3>which is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say that I would.</v>

925
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I would disagree with you in a sense in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the finding out the way that nature</v>

926
00:49:47.761 --> 00:49:48.594
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is the is is is only done </v>

927
00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.610
<v Speaker 3>through what we might loosely call the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific method,</v>

928
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:57.503
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is which is making observations </v>

929
00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:01.290
<v Speaker 3>and building theories and checking them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

930
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not surprising to me that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a thought a few thousand years ago,</v>

931
00:50:06.961 --> 00:50:10.470
<v Speaker 3>which turns out to be in accord with </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we discover.</v>

932
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.203
<v Speaker 3>Where I would disagree is I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they had those thoughts by some </v>

933
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.760
<v Speaker 3>royal road to the truth or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that.</v>

934
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:23.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say these.</v>

935
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:27.350
<v Speaker 3>You say in some context a religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>context or theological context.</v>

936
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Few thousand years ago,</v>

937
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 1>we think for the sake of argument in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koran,</v>

938
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it back in that gates of Ellis Larry</v>

939
00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.600
<v Speaker 1>say we say we think that we live in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding universe.</v>

940
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So we think there's points of light in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky or other worlds as,</v>

941
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.913
<v Speaker 1>as people did say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think they're all rushing away </v>

942
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:47.030
<v Speaker 1>from each from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

943
00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:47.864
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

944
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.063
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

945
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>certainly for the galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>

946
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that someone said that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you could imagine saying,</v>

947
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine looking at those points </v>
<v Speaker 1>of light in dreaming,</v>

948
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.700
<v Speaker 1>that there are other worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually Giordano Bruno famously did</v>

949
00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 1>that and got burned at the stake in Rome</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and his ashes thrown into the Tiber.</v>

950
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:06.734
<v Speaker 1>I think as part of the new year's </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrations that could very well that </v>

951
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 1>grow and expand across the Tiber </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitless particles because he said that</v>

952
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these are the worlds and,</v>

953
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and wells without end limitless.</v>

954
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And now he had no reason to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pure thought,</v>

955
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:22.933
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine someone saying very politically </v>

956
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turned out to be right,</v>

957
00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that he was right,</v>

958
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:30.404
<v Speaker 1>it was coincidental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he had some path route to </v>

959
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 1>knowledge through meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

960
00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there is a route to knowledge of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>through meditation.</v>

961
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 1>There may well be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is a route to inner peace</v>

962
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and a better understanding of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your relationship with nature,</v>

963
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not think that you can find out a.</v>

964
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 1>You could build new physical theories </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

965
00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 1>by meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

966
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.890
<v Speaker 1>by meditating alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinking.</v>

967
00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have to just crap when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a flash of intuition or inspiration,</v>

968
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:05.894
<v Speaker 1>all these things and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is entering the world </v>

969
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 1>through people's consciousness check it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is by doing science.</v>

970
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Definitely check it through science yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just dreaming about something.</v>

971
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to check it and that is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of like,</v>

972
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:18.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think from whatever angle you </v>

973
00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 1>approach it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into Dogma and doctrine and</v>

974
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 1>telling people what to do and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be and what they can't be.</v>

975
00:52:24.261 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you get into really dicey </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory from my perspective,</v>

976
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 1>where the bias is is has gone towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of science,</v>

977
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 1>particularly economics and particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>political science.</v>

978
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Like what I'll watch your programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch you talk about the way that </v>

979
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:42.360
<v Speaker 1>was is behaving and pebbles in lakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life of strawberries of me.</v>

980
00:52:42.361 --> 00:52:43.194
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome and beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious and precisely what we need to </v>

981
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:47.804
<v Speaker 1>examine and track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I feel is is somehow the same </v>

982
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:51.720
<v Speaker 1>way as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 1>one could say the philosophy of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 1>was used to underwrite a great big,</v>

984
00:52:57.111 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 1>powerful economic institution that ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>up saying,</v>

985
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:00.883
<v Speaker 1>don't put back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will revisit v people for Anatomy is </v>

986
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people use science to say don't </v>

987
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:09.640
<v Speaker 1>think that live there a bay these rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is this.</v>

988
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.573
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is entirely wrong because </v>

989
00:53:12.081 --> 00:53:17.081
<v Speaker 1>science science is a body of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't tell you anything really.</v>

990
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't tell you anything about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

991
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:21.523
<v Speaker 1>what to make of that knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it can tell you there are 2 </v>

992
00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>trillion in the observable</v>

993
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.510
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>full stop.</v>

994
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't tell you what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

995
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you to make it that doesn't tell</v>

996
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:33.384
<v Speaker 3>you it's the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to go back to </v>

997
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 3>oppenheimer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

998
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 3>the idea that so you can build an atomic</v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb and science tells you,</v>

999
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 3>it gives you the knowledge so that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can build an atomic bomb.</v>

1000
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.070
<v Speaker 3>It certainly does not tell you what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with it right now.</v>

1001
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:49.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually we would argue that common </v>

1002
00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 3>sense tells you not to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't press that button.</v>

1003
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1004
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 3>so I think that's a key point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

1005
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1006
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 3>the proper interaction between science </v>
<v Speaker 3>and religion and philosophy and theology</v>

1007
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:05.544
<v Speaker 3>and art and music and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this data is that they go together </v>

1008
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:14.210
<v Speaker 3>to allow us to build a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a view of what our place in the universe</v>

1009
00:54:15.621 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 3>is and what it means to be human.</v>

1010
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 3>None of them on the own will allow you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build that idea,</v>

1011
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 3>to come to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean to be human?</v>

1012
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.990
<v Speaker 3>But you need them all for so beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1013
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antithesis,</v>

1014
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 3>synthesis that you have to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1015
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And that means that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've mentioned a lot,</v>

1016
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:35.454
<v Speaker 3>Bryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is humility that that there needs to be </v>

1017
00:54:37.531 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 3>humility in all these communities and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense,</v>

1018
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 3>an idea of an objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

1019
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 3>about sort of a with the libertarianism </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate individualism,</v>

1020
00:54:46.381 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 3>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so of aversion of the subjugation of the</v>

1021
00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 3>individual in favor of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to,</v>

1022
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.753
<v Speaker 3>in order to build systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human systems that make sense to us is </v>

1023
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.350
<v Speaker 3>going to need to be a collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 3>between science,</v>

1024
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.360
<v Speaker 3>spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our theology,</v>

1025
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 3>and all these taxonomies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interchangeable.</v>

1026
00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Because one man spirituality is another </v>
<v Speaker 3>man's science night.</v>

1027
00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I recognize that what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the bandwidth of material energy that</v>

1028
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 3>can be measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnified,</v>

1029
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 3>shrunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weighed out,</v>

1030
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 3>double blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested.</v>

1031
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 3>There are certain things that we can say</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this plane of factual at this time,</v>

1032
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 3>at this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this level.</v>

1033
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.413
<v Speaker 3>I think the crisis that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>through at the moment that a </v>

1034
00:55:25.801 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 3>civilization is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have a point.</v>

1035
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a meaning to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and I just made a program a</v>

1036
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:34.083
<v Speaker 3>while ago about commercial spaceflight </v>
<v Speaker 3>until it's people like Elon Musk and </v>

1037
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:37.554
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bezos and the these entrepreneurs </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were trying to go out beyond the </v>

1038
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 3>earth and they all share a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain philosophy,</v>

1039
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.044
<v Speaker 3>which is that humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking for meaning what </v>

1040
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 3>drives us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need frontiers,</v>

1041
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.083
<v Speaker 3>frontiers of knowledge there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you might call intellectual or </v>

1042
00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 3>spiritual frontiers and physical from </v>
<v Speaker 3>tears.</v>

1043
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.713
<v Speaker 3>We need somewhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl Sagan once said that somewhere out </v>

1044
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something waiting to be known in</v>

1045
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:03.003
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

1046
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1047
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.940
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1048
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.823
<v Speaker 3>we don't have that on the earth anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no frontiers rather obviously </v>

1049
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.833
<v Speaker 3>both political borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are no places that we haven't </v>

1050
00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no wild west push into.</v>

1051
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.790
<v Speaker 3>And so they think that the next step to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go out upwards to the stars to step onto</v>

1052
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 3>the moon and to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And beyond that,</v>

1053
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 3>the place where</v>

1054
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.350
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we will find meaning again.</v>

1055
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Well I hope possibly there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1056
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:28.864
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly very intrepid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would query the idea that we are </v>

1057
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:32.794
<v Speaker 1>without frontiers because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain ideological and physical spaces </v>

1058
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 1>that we have not tried to access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have not here on what value is it?</v>

1059
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 1>If we start building new societies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

1060
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:46.000
<v Speaker 1>if down here on bloody earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're treating each other appallingly.</v>

1061
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.043
<v Speaker 1>There are basic principles that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>found their way into common </v>

1062
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly for spirituality with long,</v>

1063
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:52.684
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before monotheism pantheistic </v>

1064
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:55.923
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All find versions of look after one </v>

1065
00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.014
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say there isn't a you and </v>

1066
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you would know much more than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of brutality in nature,</v>

1067
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:07.420
<v Speaker 1>whether it's zoology or astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a brutality and a finality,</v>

1068
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 1>but are these the principles that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be governed by human beings?</v>

1069
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:12.003
<v Speaker 1>For the frontiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be interested in traversing and </v>

1070
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:18.730
<v Speaker 1>heading toward a quality love new </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that give us,</v>

1071
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:19.564
<v Speaker 1>once again a vision so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of space becomes valid but </v>

1072
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.900
<v Speaker 1>not once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of economic power,</v>

1073
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the pursue of dominions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominions new.</v>

1074
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 1>We've conquered and subjugated mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1075
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>They see what other planets we can fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1076
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:34.663
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ideas is that how do you </v>

1077
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:38.870
<v Speaker 1>develop new political systems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>

1078
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1079
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:41.221
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1080
00:57:41.221 --> 00:57:41.781
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1081
00:57:41.781 --> 00:57:42.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1082
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.153
<v Speaker 1>the movement from Europe into America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that ended up with the American </v>

1083
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:49.020
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>

1084
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:54.060
<v Speaker 1>there are obviously there were pros and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cons of this steady Brian Slavery,</v>

1085
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.393
<v Speaker 1>but you got to sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you got was this </v>

1086
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:02.890
<v Speaker 1>document which I think is widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized as one of the,</v>

1087
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1088
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the most important statements of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might send nice poems,</v>

1089
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but if it doesn't relate to the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>run a society,</v>

1090
00:58:08.771 --> 00:58:09.604
<v Speaker 1>then what value is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is precisely the problem now </v>

1091
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.120
<v Speaker 1>which is not put it into practice if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

1092
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And even then Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was except for these people,</v>

1093
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for women except for these people</v>

1094
00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:18.754
<v Speaker 1>that live here already.</v>

1095
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.693
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this certainly there is a relationship </v>

1096
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 1>between the physical and the spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1097
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:24.934
<v Speaker 1>if we grow into new territory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically there is a possibility that </v>

1098
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 1>will somehow help us to discover within </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves new notions.</v>

1099
00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:32.130
<v Speaker 1>But like we can do that without getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a spaceship,</v>

1100
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:32.973
<v Speaker 1>we could just start saying that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge people couldn't what they look </v>

1101
00:58:34.781 --> 00:58:35.614
<v Speaker 1>like or some of the ideas is that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>system on this planet now it's become </v>

1102
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:40.950
<v Speaker 1>quite ossified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that mean?</v>

1103
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Not Fossil and locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you go to,</v>

1104
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:46.923
<v Speaker 1>if you imagine that in a hundred years' </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or something we have the Mars </v>

1105
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:50.974
<v Speaker 1>colony is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is looking to become independent and </v>

1106
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.233
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1107
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1108
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.813
<v Speaker 1>the act of going to a new place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning again can allow you to access </v>

1109
00:58:59.171 --> 00:59:00.004
<v Speaker 1>different ways of being in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of interacting that might not be </v>

1110
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:06.640
<v Speaker 1>possible here because of the historic </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders and,</v>

1111
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and problems they may have.</v>

1112
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:09.743
<v Speaker 1>I sort of agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make me want to get on </v>

1113
00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:13.570
<v Speaker 1>a spaceship that makes people want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the barricade.</v>

1114
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:14.613
<v Speaker 1>It makes me want to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me say if we've reached a sort </v>

1115
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:20.230
<v Speaker 1>of a point of crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for me it's not like,</v>

1116
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 1>oh bloody hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go somewhere else.</v>

1117
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 1>For me it's like we're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1118
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You will know that the one area where </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is not being allowed to a,</v>

1119
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 1>not the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I an area where science is not being</v>

1120
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 1>allowed to inform the way we treat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet is with climate change.</v>

1121
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 1>People are not going right steady </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for me,</v>

1122
00:59:37.671 --> 00:59:39.200
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've learned over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of this podcast,</v>

1123
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:40.034
<v Speaker 1>and I must say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ones that have been like a </v>

1124
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:44.150
<v Speaker 1>great big iceberg of inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing into my consciousness.</v>

1125
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.713
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I can stay afloat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely every other vessel in that </v>

1126
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:48.920
<v Speaker 1>analogy is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1127
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all our ideologies are caveated by.</v>

1128
00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 1>And as long as it doesn't affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of the powerful,</v>

1129
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>we must do something about climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

1130
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 1>As long as it doesn't affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of the powerful,</v>

1131
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.310
<v Speaker 1>we must have says as long as it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact later.</v>

1132
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.273
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about finding ways of impact the </v>

1133
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:07.034
<v Speaker 1>interests of the powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until we are prepared to do that and to </v>

1134
01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:10.754
<v Speaker 1>ever better address that frontier is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in jumping on Elan Musk space </v>

1135
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>craft or saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1136
01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it is a virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

1137
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>We have to start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening?</v>

1138
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>These people are behaving in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1139
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:21.584
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be regulated and stopped </v>

1140
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and stripped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1141
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that Jeff Bezos,</v>

1142
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon Ceo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got a company blue origin,</v>

1143
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>and he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1144
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>why is this company called blue origin?</v>

1145
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Because it refers to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue origin of humanity,</v>

1146
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:35.803
<v Speaker 1>and he said that the one thing we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned in our exploration of the solar </v>

1147
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>system and beyond is that this planet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best one,</v>

1148
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've learned that number one,</v>

1149
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:44.893
<v Speaker 1>and that means that is a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls it a jewel of a planet and </v>

1150
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>therefore we must protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

1151
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.493
<v Speaker 1>we have a large population which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making increase in depends on the </v>

1152
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the solution?</v>

1153
01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>How do you support an expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

1154
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.743
<v Speaker 1>all of whom want a better life for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their children at the same time is </v>

1155
01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:04.214
<v Speaker 1>protecting this beautiful blue planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is to get the resources from </v>

1156
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>

1157
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:11.723
<v Speaker 1>Answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one would be to start </v>

1158
01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>prioritizing the health of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>above economic needs.</v>

1159
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>As long as you've got a capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1160
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.873
<v Speaker 1>in the form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's now way in which many people would </v>

1161
01:01:20.691 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>argue is way beyond capitalism.</v>

1162
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:22.993
<v Speaker 1>Then then it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what Marx is critical theory that </v>

1163
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the first discovery page one is this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a limited resource we are.</v>

1164
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>It cannot provide limited growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's got to go there.</v>

1165
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>May well have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can argue that you have a point in,</v>

1166
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:37.664
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America and the West that you </v>

1167
01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>might call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you talk about sub Saharan Africa</v>

1168
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.173
<v Speaker 1>or India or large parts of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is difficult to see how you can </v>

1169
01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>lift those people out of poverty at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

1170
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.673
<v Speaker 1>That reducing the demand on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those people are there and they </v>

1171
01:01:55.371 --> 01:01:56.204
<v Speaker 1>live in poverty and it's right that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspire to a better life for their </v>

1172
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1173
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer can,</v>

1174
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>can be innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1175
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:05.234
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in China about two weeks ago and </v>

1176
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>they just canceled the building of 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal fired power stations.</v>

1177
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Canceled it and the reason they </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancelled it was because solar power is </v>

1178
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was purely,</v>

1179
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.433
<v Speaker 1>it was partly market driven decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they have a problem with </v>

1180
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:22.374
<v Speaker 1>pollution in the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is the innovation has </v>

1181
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>delivered a solution because solar power</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes no impact on the planet.</v>

1182
01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:29.624
<v Speaker 1>It's too shuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like once you know that wisdom is </v>

1183
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>acting on knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we have that,</v>

1184
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the facts just in the next thing should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be around a phone calls like,</v>

1185
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

1186
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Now solar power only as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1187
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.513
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose interests do you challenge when </v>

1188
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you make that edict?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So?</v>

1189
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I've got side very quickly.</v>

1190
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I know you've got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess where I'm going.</v>

1191
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally going to church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know I was talking to Brian Cox </v>

1192
01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:57.894
<v Speaker 1>early to do in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a guy who sat next to me on </v>

1193
01:03:00.281 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the panel and he was in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a property developer and he said,</v>

1194
01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1195
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about China that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rather,</v>

1196
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>which is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

1197
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.071
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1198
01:03:10.071 --> 01:03:10.904
<v Speaker 1>the interests that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fossil fuel interests that those </v>

1199
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>big companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1200
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist in China.</v>

1201
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:19.710
<v Speaker 1>The ruling party make the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made the decision based on we don't</v>

1202
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 1>want pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want less pollution.</v>

1203
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Could it's killing our people and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want cheap,</v>

1204
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:24.653
<v Speaker 1>accessible power that is solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So immediately I will draw a line </v>

1205
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.463
<v Speaker 1>through 105th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contract for 150 coal fired power </v>

1206
01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>stations and I'll change it to solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>panels.</v>

1207
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.733
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1208
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.780
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1209
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>he argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do obviously counter arguments,</v>

1210
01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but he argued that that's why he said to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1211
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 1>that's why China will beat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat you,</v>

1212
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:46.260
<v Speaker 1>because we will make decisions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1213
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Now we could debate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting.</v>

1214
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that's always is distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that China,</v>

1215
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it comes from a different philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

1216
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:55.584
<v Speaker 1>has a completely different Veltin Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's able to make decisions like </v>

1217
01:03:58.561 --> 01:03:59.394
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because of Maoism and post </v>

1218
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.853
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the philosophies that </v>

1219
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>proceeded it.</v>

1220
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:04.923
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said just because when people are </v>

1221
01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:06.954
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there are big problems with </v>

1222
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:09.024
<v Speaker 1>human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking I'm not waving the flag </v>

1223
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:11.034
<v Speaker 1>for the Chinese system and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems within which those interests </v>

1224
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>matter a lot less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1225
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

1226
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:18.324
<v Speaker 1>And that's what is interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I feel Brian Cox is that you have </v>

1227
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>been kind of I in my language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I profit and an educator and a Swami for</v>

1228
01:04:29.551 --> 01:04:30.384
<v Speaker 1>such valuable beautiful information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who knows what the future holds for </v>

1229
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.121
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1230
01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you get my vote on the next David </v>
<v Speaker 1>attenborough deal.</v>

1231
01:04:38.651 --> 01:04:39.121
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1232
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:39.954
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see he was very much the human voice </v>

1233
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

1234
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:43.704
<v Speaker 1>like as you have indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be many voices in the </v>

1235
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>human conversation for us to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

1236
01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1237
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.323
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I feel like is that there is much </v>

1238
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 1>to learn from the realms that can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>be empirically demonstrated.</v>

1239
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And now like I know that sounds quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>high minded by simply talking about love</v>

1240
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and kindness and the ability for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people for,</v>

1241
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>to have their needs met and to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on the power Sagan said,</v>

1242
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.403
<v Speaker 1>for small creatures such as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vastness is variable only through </v>

1243
01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1244
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's given to us.</v>

1245
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Where Brian Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to on record,</v>

1246
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>make a commitment to come back and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed again.</v>

1247
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1248
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it very much.</v>

1249
01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I will be back tomorrow with you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really loved it.</v>

1250
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Might get intense because we're coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at things from quite different </v>

1251
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:26.963
<v Speaker 1>impositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I absolutely adore you and I'm very </v>

1252
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>grateful to you for the education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1253
01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed it very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

1254
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:32.314
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>
