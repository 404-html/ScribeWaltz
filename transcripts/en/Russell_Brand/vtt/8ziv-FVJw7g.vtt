<v Speaker 1>intrepid hero since Scott of the </v>

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Ed Stafford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank,</v>

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you for very much for coming on under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin.</v>

11
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.543
<v Speaker 1>Absolute pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fascinates me most about your work </v>

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.873
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of a survivalist or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventurer is the way that you talk </v>

13
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.663
<v Speaker 1>sort of conscious and spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>component of surviving in extreme </v>

15
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:50.704
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a way your background is </v>

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 1>traditional in the sense that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the military,</v>

17
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>is straight into the skin then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it really?</v>

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.673
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the world of adventure.</v>

22
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Have done it off the back of a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

24
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the obvious parts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure that crossing rivers,</v>

25
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 2>climbing mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of toughing it out,</v>

26
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really interest me as merchant the</v>

27
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 2>psychological aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly I think,</v>

28
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 2>there is a very physical element in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I do,</v>

30
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 2>but the whole thing since the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>onwards has been,</v>

31
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been a bit of a spiritual journey.</v>

32
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:30.474
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

33
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.683
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting for me how such a sort </v>

34
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.554
<v Speaker 2>of stereotypical blokey bloke's job has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up being actually one which has </v>

35
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:39.204
<v Speaker 2>been quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>quite okay.</v>

37
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Sort of spiritual journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perhaps what fascinates me most.</v>

39
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.893
<v Speaker 1>Was that something that it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superficially seems to be about over </v>

40
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>modes of masculinity such as toughness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>

41
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>survival optimally in your view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes down to our spirituality.</v>

42
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's evolved at the most.</v>

43
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:00.374
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

44
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 2>when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

45
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to walk the length of the Amazon,</v>

46
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.383
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a lot of ego involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I really wanted to prove to the </v>

47
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 2>world that I was super turf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat my chest and um,</v>

48
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 2>do something that everyone was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>was impossible.</v>

49
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:15.214
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

50
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 2>in fact that really annoyed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.734
<v Speaker 2>everyone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

52
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.933
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they laughed at me or they didn't </v>

53
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 2>think it was possible and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

54
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to prove him wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was literally a two finger salute to,</v>

55
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>to those sort of naysayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

56
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:28.384
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because it started in quite a sort </v>

57
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:35.011
<v Speaker 2>of a macho way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's taken me by surprise,</v>

58
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>the journey it's taken me on because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing macho about what I do is</v>

59
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't need to prove anything to</v>

61
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

62
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.130
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is just an age thing.</v>

63
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:46.964
<v Speaker 2>I'm 41 now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think as you get older you don't </v>

64
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 2>need to show off quite as much as he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kid.</v>

65
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

66
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

67
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 2>certainly I think that what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>now is quite a,</v>

68
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.510
<v Speaker 2>it's quite meaningful and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't,</v>

69
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

70
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it keeps me learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps me in a position of being quite</v>

71
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>humble as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were in the military,</v>

72
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.163
<v Speaker 2>my superficial and inexperienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive understanding of life in the </v>

73
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.164
<v Speaker 2>military is that a must be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing on you physically and mentally </v>

74
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>and it must be a lot about making </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals behave in a cohesive way and</v>

75
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.774
<v Speaker 2>respond well to all 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that like for you as an </v>

76
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.784
<v Speaker 2>individual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you like for your mental </v>

77
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>health at the time you spent in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>army?</v>

78
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I,</v>

79
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took to the army at all.</v>

80
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.854
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm a joins because I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll around in the burden throughout an </v>

81
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:41.960
<v Speaker 2>outdoor job and not sit behind a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

82
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 2>and in that respect it's always correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never really.</v>

83
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.323
<v Speaker 2>There's a fear that I don't know whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand when we even see a </v>

84
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>military camp and all that barbwire </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the outside.</v>

85
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.963
<v Speaker 2>When I go into Cam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get properly scared inside on </v>

86
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:56.344
<v Speaker 2>the left as a captain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't arguably be scared of the </v>

87
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>campus if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

88
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 2>if you're at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

89
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 2>and yet I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very disciplined environment.</v>

90
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It was a very strict environment and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one that is run on,</v>

91
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 2>run on discipline and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

92
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of regime.</v>

93
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And that wasn't me at all.</v>

94
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have taken a lot from the </v>

95
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've always been quite a free spirit</v>

96
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.284
<v Speaker 2>and I've always liked the ability to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want to do and get up in the </v>

97
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>morning and I'd like to plan my own day </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>

98
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next six months in advance has </v>

99
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>been planned for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was never really me.</v>

100
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.843
<v Speaker 2>Even in training at Santa Stowe was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>counting the days til I finished </v>

101
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the other recruits were.</v>

102
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I was counting the days to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>could leave the military because I could</v>

103
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 2>tell it wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet it was something I almost did as</v>

104
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.423
<v Speaker 2>a of finishing school and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's given me the skills I needed to do </v>

105
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:42.904
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you flourish in an environment </v>

106
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.353
<v Speaker 2>that was so counter to the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be in the way you saw </v>

107
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

108
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you obviously succeeded,</v>

109
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>you've got to the rank of captain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many years were you in the military?</v>

110
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in for four years.</v>

111
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I didn't flourish if I'm honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

113
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've come into myself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>more recent years.</v>

114
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my early thirties rather than I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mid twenties.</v>

115
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was when I was in the military.</v>

116
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:09.334
<v Speaker 2>I remember telling my commanding officer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was gonna leave and he just </v>

117
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:14.171
<v Speaker 2>smiled and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

118
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>that's probably best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

119
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

120
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't that good because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I was into it,</v>

121
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any interest in guns.</v>

122
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:23.524
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go on Stag do's to Las Vegas and </v>

123
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>she just leaves me cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in.</v>

124
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I did spend time in Afghanistan and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other consultants,</v>

125
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

126
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't wait to decommission the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons off the Afghans so they could go</v>

127
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.234
<v Speaker 2>into the middle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the middle of the desert and shoot </v>

128
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>bazookas and stuff and that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not me at all.</v>

129
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.440
<v Speaker 2>And invariably you can bluff your case </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a little while and then after awhile</v>

130
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 2>reached the rank of captain and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

131
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>this is about as senior as I want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bluff in my case,</v>

132
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.373
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's more to life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the battalion was going back to </v>

133
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Northern Ireland for two more years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a really quite difficult</v>

134
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>jobs to keep the soldiers motivated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sort of environments.</v>

135
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided it was time to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I personally,</v>

136
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:04.804
<v Speaker 1>I have tremendous respect for anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can endure the military because </v>

137
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>when I imagined myself in those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments,</v>

138
00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:13.990
<v Speaker 1>when you took right individuality in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a necessity respond to discipline.</v>

139
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:14.824
<v Speaker 1>That makes me feel really scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you said about the </v>

140
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:18.254
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also have this sense that the </v>

141
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd refer to it as a finishing school,</v>

142
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:22.684
<v Speaker 1>might be a place where greatness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>accessed in that you are tested as an </v>

143
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:27.604
<v Speaker 1>individual and like the whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can overcome and some mount certain </v>

144
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:32.200
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair?</v>

145
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was like in some ways in</v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospect?</v>

146
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the explorers around the world </v>

147
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.660
<v Speaker 2>have been in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a runoff fines and you know,</v>

148
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 2>all of the people who have made a name </v>
<v Speaker 2>for themselves.</v>

149
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.730
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it gave me a set of skills.</v>

150
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:52.990
<v Speaker 2>It gave me not just the physical skills </v>
<v Speaker 2>packing a work site and navigating those</v>

151
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:53.824
<v Speaker 2>sort of very obvious wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it allowed me to think </v>

152
00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:57.790
<v Speaker 2>flexibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarrely.</v>

153
00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And you'd think that the military would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be quite,</v>

154
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:02.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regimented with the way it thinks.</v>

155
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:03.670
<v Speaker 2>But they have got this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission command,</v>

156
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:04.504
<v Speaker 2>which essentially means if you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end state of what you're trying to </v>

157
00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.620
<v Speaker 2>achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your commanding officers told you the</v>

158
00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:11.454
<v Speaker 2>end state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's up to you as to how you do it and </v>

159
00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it does allow a lot of flexibility,</v>

160
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>conquer that area or get you to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

161
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>attack that trench and it's up to you as</v>
<v Speaker 2>to whether you go,</v>

162
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:23.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the stream,</v>

163
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.240
<v Speaker 2>straight up the middle or around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest and to recover or whatever it is.</v>

164
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>So enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That side of things.</v>

165
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I think when I came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started leading expeditions,</v>

166
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:34.864
<v Speaker 2>it was good to be able to know that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could deal with situations and I can be </v>

167
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.324
<v Speaker 2>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did massively have to take my </v>

168
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>military hat off in many respects </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

169
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people that I was dealing </v>

170
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>with were local people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people from potentially third</v>

171
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 2>world countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't just go in there with your</v>

172
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:51.304
<v Speaker 2>sort of army hat on telling people what </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do or expecting things to run like </v>

173
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:55.054
<v Speaker 2>clockwork because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll just end up exploding out of </v>

174
00:07:56.951 --> 00:07:57.784
<v Speaker 2>sheer frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to completely take that off </v>

175
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.840
<v Speaker 2>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chuck it all away quite frankly.</v>

176
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.723
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

177
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.613
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to share that side of the </v>

178
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:07.200
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 2>as I go on year by year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military has less and less influence</v>

180
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 2>over who I am today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

181
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

182
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:19.861
<v Speaker 1>while you were in the military question </v>
<v Speaker 1>the agenda and the objectives and this I</v>

183
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 1>suppose that inherently what is within </v>
<v Speaker 1>military is,</v>

184
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of force,</v>

185
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the idea of coercion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of control.</v>

186
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 1>So there are a lot of things like on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the level of our national identity,</v>

187
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 1>we have to conceal about the role of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

188
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to individual soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is very,</v>

189
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:37.804
<v Speaker 1>very brave that anyone's prepared to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself through that kind of suffering </v>

190
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:40.714
<v Speaker 1>and I admire them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about like the sort of </v>

191
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the political objectives of a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

192
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:45.994
<v Speaker 1>for example in Northern Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll just take one very complex </v>

193
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 1>subject to that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble you.</v>

194
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

195
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:55.424
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really believed in the Northern </v>

196
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Ireland occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.214
<v Speaker 2>when we're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was therefore difficult to put </v>

198
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.910
<v Speaker 2>on a and official face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in charge of 30 soldiers.</v>

199
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.050
<v Speaker 2>They were looking to me to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

200
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.433
<v Speaker 2>lead them through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this experience of occupying a </v>

201
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.280
<v Speaker 2>another nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Speaker 2>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we weren't fighting,</v>

203
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were unwanted there,</v>

204
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was spit in the face.</v>

205
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kidding me.</v>

206
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You've had that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

207
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.273
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every and every British army soldier </v>

208
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.233
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's done any patrols in Northern </v>

209
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Ireland would have had that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

210
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.813
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was your back yard and suddenly </v>

211
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.333
<v Speaker 2>observation Qataris are going up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are spying on your houses and </v>

212
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be pretty outraged to.</v>

213
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't feel any negativity </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards anything.</v>

214
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.933
<v Speaker 1>No people that did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe in what I was doing if </v>

215
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that must be.</v>

216
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:44.774
<v Speaker 1>I imagine it'd be hard enough if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one had the mentality of queen and </v>

217
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:52.210
<v Speaker 1>country and the right of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire to Ra and occupy other territory.</v>

218
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So it would still be out if someone spit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your face.</v>

219
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you sort of felt it was wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

220
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>did it just feel like the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of your own doubts?</v>

221
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.513
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you sign up for some things </v>

222
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.990
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is really tricky,</v>

223
00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:06.830
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you,</v>

224
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.643
<v Speaker 2>because everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I've developed over the course of </v>

225
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.703
<v Speaker 2>years and ability to tell whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>something's right or wrong by sort of </v>

226
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>trusting my gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.640
<v Speaker 2>intuitively know whether you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something that didn't.</v>

228
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.853
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd signed up to an organization which </v>

229
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.110
<v Speaker 2>it's got nothing to do with feelings or </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuition.</v>

230
00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:23.944
<v Speaker 2>It was just literally this is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>orders and this is what you've got to </v>

231
00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of just,</v>

232
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.213
<v Speaker 2>I've got to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of just accepted that this is a </v>

233
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:33.490
<v Speaker 2>role that you've got to fulfill for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next year or two years or whatever.</v>

234
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.110
<v Speaker 2>And once you've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

235
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Then you can then break free and live </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life as you want to do it.</v>

236
00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:40.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think I just sucked it up and got </v>
<v Speaker 2>on with it</v>

237
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go back to it now.</v>

238
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it then?</v>

239
00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:46.690
<v Speaker 1>So having been schooled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardened,</v>

240
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught by the military,</v>

241
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 1>or how was it that you found yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to the seemingly impossible?</v>

242
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.324
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you were strongly advised </v>

243
00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:57.874
<v Speaker 1>against trying to walk the Amazon not </v>
<v Speaker 1>least because it's made of water and </v>

244
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:02.650
<v Speaker 1>then new cheeses can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

245
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 1>that you were at five today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were insurmountable challenges.</v>

246
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.653
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to you in a period from </v>

247
00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:09.274
<v Speaker 1>leaving the military term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on these great physical and </v>

248
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.870
<v Speaker 1>psychological trials?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

249
00:11:13.871 --> 00:11:15.700
<v Speaker 1>what made you think you could do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you want to do?</v>

250
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I think as much as the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

251
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.053
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get on with it for the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've explained what I did like is </v>

252
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:24.860
<v Speaker 2>being outdoors and what I did like his </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical challenges and,</v>

253
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and spending time next to nature,</v>

254
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.464
<v Speaker 2>I've got to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the first job I took when coming </v>

255
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 2>out of the military was taking gap year </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids on,</v>

256
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on trips into the rain forest.</v>

257
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So they were building a new visitor </v>
<v Speaker 2>center for National Park or something.</v>

258
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 to 24 year olds,</v>

259
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:41.214
<v Speaker 2>they're having a life changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and I got the chance to use </v>

260
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>the knife skills that come out with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

261
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 2>have been able to take them into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle safely.</v>

262
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.443
<v Speaker 2>There'd be sleeping in hammocks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington rivers and maybe doing a </v>

263
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 2>project which has got an ecological aim </v>
<v Speaker 2>or community based Damon.</v>

264
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.593
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was perfect as far as I was </v>

265
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living at almost,</v>

266
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got paid next to nothing for that </v>

267
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:02.974
<v Speaker 2>job because it was charity work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was using all the really nice </v>

268
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:06.304
<v Speaker 2>touchy feely part of it was taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was taking the army or expedition </v>

269
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and actually putting it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>good purpose.</v>

270
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:15.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was always a conservation or,</v>

272
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 2>or community aim and mission to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to each one of the expeditions.</v>

273
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>And I flourished in that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

274
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I did it for about eight or nine years </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

275
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really enjoyed it.</v>

276
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn during that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

277
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:32.610
<v Speaker 2>it was more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not ordering people around</v>

278
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 2>paying volunteers coming on these trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

279
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:39.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more just about letting go of all</v>

280
00:12:39.211 --> 00:12:40.044
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the worries and all of the fears </v>

281
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Speaker 2>that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd had building,</v>

282
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 2>being in the military.</v>

283
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.213
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly people are all around me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were having an amazing life changing </v>

284
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

285
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.593
<v Speaker 2>if when you pull people into the jungle </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and everyone's wearing the </v>

286
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 2>same grubby trousers and shirt and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

287
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fashion,</v>

288
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's everything stripped away.</v>

289
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:00.454
<v Speaker 2>And yet people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every single person on these </v>

290
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.684
<v Speaker 2>expeditions at the time would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been the most amazing thing </v>

291
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I've ever done in my life because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>come together.</v>

292
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 2>They bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really hard.</v>

293
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>They're living in this almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commune in the middle of it,</v>

294
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

295
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it was extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewarding.</v>

296
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 2>It taught people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.660
<v Speaker 2>what life's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to look after each other,</v>

298
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 2>how to work as a team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

299
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 2>it was a youth development charity as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

300
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:26.524
<v Speaker 2>So it was all about these people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably didn't know anything about </v>

301
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

302
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is the first time they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly traveled away from home,</v>

303
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.583
<v Speaker 2>but they've done it in quite a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organized way because it's led by </v>

304
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 2>someone like me who is ex military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

305
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost.</v>

306
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost every single person that I'm in </v>

307
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:43.234
<v Speaker 2>contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the volunteers that came on </v>

308
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>those trips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

309
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.083
<v Speaker 2>it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed their attitudes towards each </v>

310
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change their attitudes towards nature,</v>

311
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:53.400
<v Speaker 2>and they've got a huge amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People began to feel connected when they</v>

312
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 2>talk to each other and to nature and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they really are,</v>

313
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.713
<v Speaker 2>I suppose with what we ca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's implicit in that is that living </v>

314
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 2>in a civilized culture disconnects you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from yourself.</v>

315
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 2>One Star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two star,</v>

316
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:08.694
<v Speaker 2>or we start to form attachments to </v>
<v Speaker 2>material objects to things that aren't </v>

317
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:13.564
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way that we envisage people </v>

318
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 2>isn't investigated for when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>put into an environment that is stripped</v>

319
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:21.420
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason they feel so grateful,</v>

320
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 2>so connected is because they discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of truth.</v>

321
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.833
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose the spirituality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence is about the discovery of truth </v>

322
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is beautiful.</v>

323
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 2>The truth is connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not alienation.</v>

324
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Last despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And I think you hit the nail on the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>by saying it's not really.</v>

326
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't adding anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just stripping stuff away.</v>

327
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the nonsense,</v>

328
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>all of the phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the distractions,</v>

329
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 2>things that will turn to when we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling good drugs,</v>

331
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate,</v>

332
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There aren't any of those,</v>

333
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone was having to deal with a </v>

334
00:14:57.061 --> 00:15:00.540
<v Speaker 2>very raw version of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was lovely for star and</v>

335
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day people used to tell </v>

336
00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:08.160
<v Speaker 2>stories didn't and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would light a fire in the evening and</v>

337
00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:10.350
<v Speaker 2>cook on it and then sit around and chat </v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

338
00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:11.184
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're looking up at the stars </v>

339
00:15:12.961 --> 00:15:15.150
<v Speaker 2>you're contemplating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was again,</v>

340
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.490
<v Speaker 2>a world stripped away of the nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

341
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

342
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.040
<v Speaker 1>his trip to have a nonsense means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go within themselves,</v>

343
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:23.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't imagine it's just plain </v>
<v Speaker 1>sailing or sort of,</v>

344
00:15:23.831 --> 00:15:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a communal trumpton about people</v>

345
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:29.230
<v Speaker 1>go through a lot of English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

346
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean I filled a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very attracted to what you do.</v>

347
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I admire it very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's with myself.</v>

348
00:15:36.401 --> 00:15:38.910
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a lot of fear in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I think right,</v>

349
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go and live in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have your phone.</v>

350
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.150
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a phrase,</v>

351
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.250
<v Speaker 1>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We become prisoners of comfort.</v>

352
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.263
<v Speaker 1>I feel that I am in many ways a prisoner</v>
<v Speaker 1>of comfort that I have not tested </v>

353
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:50.134
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do this thing and this seems </v>

354
00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like a mad thing to tell her survival </v>
<v Speaker 1>explorer because it's so lightweight,</v>

355
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.693
<v Speaker 1>but like I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out with this woman who had an </v>

356
00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:00.610
<v Speaker 1>amazing state in the grounds of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>estate was a well beautiful.</v>

357
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Well the east stinking marsh pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

358
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And I have to jump in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

359
00:16:05.321 --> 00:16:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And when you jump in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really cold.</v>

360
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It was freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you got in there,</v>

361
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.753
<v Speaker 1>when I got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go there and I'd think well like that </v>

362
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:14.944
<v Speaker 1>my body is capable not only of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing that cold but also capable </v>

363
00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:18.934
<v Speaker 1>of making that noise and all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not experiencing that code on </v>

364
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:22.754
<v Speaker 1>making that noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disconnected from the guy that can </v>

365
00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:26.224
<v Speaker 1>handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like bobbing about just on the </v>

366
00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:29.224
<v Speaker 1>surface of who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never experiencing the truth of just as </v>

367
00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:35.350
<v Speaker 1>me as an individual on a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anatomical,</v>

368
00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:36.184
<v Speaker 1>physical and essential way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagining that in that is a tiny </v>

369
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>pipsqueak scrap of the thing that you're</v>

370
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 2>in a right that you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

371
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's A.</v>

372
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.243
<v Speaker 2>There's a movement at the moment I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>with amongst disillusion people working </v>

373
00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:54.630
<v Speaker 2>in London called going on a micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure and people will literally sort</v>

374
00:16:54.631 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 2>of five to nine I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catchphrase.</v>

375
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.563
<v Speaker 2>They'll leave work at five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll take a train out into the </v>

376
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.200
<v Speaker 2>countryside though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run up a hill,</v>

377
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.063
<v Speaker 2>sleep on top of a hill in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and jump in a river and then get it </v>

378
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.424
<v Speaker 2>back on the train and being for work the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day and I think that's quite </v>

379
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 2>indicative of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

380
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.203
<v Speaker 2>of just people not being satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of mundane life and they want </v>

381
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:15.780
<v Speaker 2>to eat really experienced life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's uncomfortable sleeping on</v>

382
00:17:15.781 --> 00:17:16.614
<v Speaker 2>the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's know bloody cold jumping into the </v>

383
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.390
<v Speaker 2>water and none of these things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually conventionally good fun and yet</v>

384
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.710
<v Speaker 2>it somehow does press a reset button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It somehow does enable them to go in the</v>

385
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.133
<v Speaker 2>next day to work with a smile on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and feeling like they've actually </v>

386
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.524
<v Speaker 2>done something and it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually explain why they're doing </v>

387
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm certainly,</v>

388
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I feel there is more to life than just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

389
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 2>getting on the tube and going to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sitting at a desk.</v>

390
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in being a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

391
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to experience as much of life as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

392
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So like in a way we can sort of build an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that urbanization,</v>

393
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.063
<v Speaker 1>industrial industrialization and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological society is a way of </v>

394
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 1>turning people into kind of the fuel for</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant factory.</v>

395
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.063
<v Speaker 1>Your role just becomes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a producer and as a consumer in many </v>

396
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:09.534
<v Speaker 1>cases more a consumer than a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your connection to nature and reality </v>

397
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>has been severed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on the tube,</v>

398
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.793
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying that these micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures are examples of people have </v>

399
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:19.824
<v Speaker 1>this yearning for what's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you saying that this year and </v>

400
00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:23.614
<v Speaker 1>any something you always add that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt I don't want to do some job where </v>

401
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically in some version of prison</v>

402
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.673
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reckon I reckon feelings more </v>

403
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.023
<v Speaker 2>personally now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reckon feeling is more important than </v>

404
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.113
<v Speaker 2>than thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we all get lost in our </v>

405
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:40.070
<v Speaker 2>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

406
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.710
<v Speaker 2>we all anxieties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fears,</v>

407
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:44.720
<v Speaker 2>all this sort of nonsense going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our heads all the time.</v>

408
00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:45.554
<v Speaker 2>And I think what I'm talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just experiences which sometimes aren't </v>

409
00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:49.454
<v Speaker 2>logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I going to go in jumping out </v>

410
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.510
<v Speaker 2>stream the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's having a very,</v>

411
00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:54.344
<v Speaker 2>very visceral experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly shocking or your body </v>

412
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:59.690
<v Speaker 2>senses it's making you feel alive again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

413
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's very hard to describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>logically.</v>

414
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:04.550
<v Speaker 2>And I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got some really,</v>

415
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>really good aboriginal Australian </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and um,</v>

416
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.930
<v Speaker 2>and they went toe to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

417
00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:12.230
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time I met this guy,</v>

418
00:19:12.231 --> 00:19:13.064
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

419
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.293
<v Speaker 2>we sat in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody sat in the room for about five </v>

420
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>minutes and obviously thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>

421
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.983
<v Speaker 2>I know of two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes he went and will you shut </v>

422
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:20.694
<v Speaker 2>the fuck up?</v>

423
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Because there were so many thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>going around my brain.</v>

424
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:24.654
<v Speaker 2>And like from an aboriginal perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll try and tell this story quite </v>

425
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.040
<v Speaker 2>shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

426
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.740
<v Speaker 2>they believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

427
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you've got three brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest brain being your,</v>

428
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.893
<v Speaker 2>your gut and your instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second biggest brain being your </v>

429
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:36.444
<v Speaker 2>heart and your emotions in the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain being the logical brain and the </v>

430
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.130
<v Speaker 2>word that they use to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical brain is called Nando.</v>

431
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.373
<v Speaker 2>Nando is also the word that they use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe a fishing net that was all </v>

432
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Speaker 2>tangled beyond repair or fucked in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

433
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's the word they used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe the logical brain and they said</v>

434
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:54.834
<v Speaker 2>the reason that western people confused </v>
<v Speaker 2>live so much is that they live in this </v>

435
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 2>logical brain and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tool.</v>

436
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Everything is meant to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy,</v>

437
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of your,</v>

438
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 2>everything that you do or the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

439
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>your life is all starts down here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

440
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.260
<v Speaker 2>it gets filtered by your heart and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and then it Latin.</v>

441
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.103
<v Speaker 2>It gets filtered in the lesser manner by</v>
<v Speaker 2>your logic and your and your logical </v>

442
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:16.194
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this for me immediately explained </v>

443
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.503
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just made everything click into </v>

444
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:22.190
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

445
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to place.</v>

446
00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a filter on the way out.</v>

447
00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>But everything has to originate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

448
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.930
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got expressions in our,</v>

449
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.460
<v Speaker 2>in our own culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

450
00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you follow your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

451
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:35.270
<v Speaker 2>they really genuinely believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

452
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I have to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have taken on the same bullish.</v>

453
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I think everything should originate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I the thing you know,</v>

454
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.563
<v Speaker 2>to live your life in an urban society </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're constantly watching the </v>

455
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 2>clock and you're in time and stresses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this sort of stuff,</v>

456
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.463
<v Speaker 2>it's all in your head isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all they were doing was to try and </v>

457
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:54.364
<v Speaker 2>tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did it because I was going to go </v>

458
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>put myself on a desert island.</v>

459
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So I thought they will be good people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak to about this.</v>

460
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you live in your head,</v>

461
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.530
<v Speaker 2>the more problems you will have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more anxieties and fears and doubts.</v>

462
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.713
<v Speaker 2>And they were absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more you can come from an </v>

463
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 2>instinctual place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all of that.</v>

464
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 2>It just evaporates in and you can live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

465
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.753
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a decent time on the </v>

466
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris,</v>

467
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.203
<v Speaker 2>great wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you go from being the man in a </v>

468
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:18.934
<v Speaker 2>car that's like baptist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut the fuck up too because you're </v>

469
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 2>thinking too loudly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you.</v>

470
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn from them and how do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that?</v>

471
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.913
<v Speaker 2>And it's been a long journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Amazon was two and a half </v>

472
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 2>years that time isolated completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm earned on the island was 60 days,</v>

473
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:35.074
<v Speaker 2>which is a long time in complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation was 60 days in complete </v>

474
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 2>isolation.</v>

475
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be completely honest.</v>

476
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I was l twice and twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sent in a because I had a satellite</v>

477
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.304
<v Speaker 2>phone to call in case there was twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought in course of antibiotics </v>

478
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 2>but then left me again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than what did you feel like in</v>

479
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 2>the moments when someone drops off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics?</v>

480
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.220
<v Speaker 2>He talked to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold me.</v>

481
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 2>You would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that I got angry at myself</v>

482
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called use the satellite phone.</v>

483
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I got angry that I was breaking this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a rule that you'd say,</v>

484
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to have 60 days in isolation</v>

485
00:22:06.921 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you call?</v>

486
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

487
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:13.120
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what was wrong.</v>

488
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were you experiencing?</v>

489
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.413
<v Speaker 2>Cramps and pains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think the first one was trapped </v>

490
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.943
<v Speaker 2>when something so in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I'd obviously got myself and </v>

491
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:25.384
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether you've spent </v>

492
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 2>extended periods of time in isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

493
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 2>may bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes.</v>

494
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I started free out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's far from a,</v>

495
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.480
<v Speaker 2>from a spiritual perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most,</v>

496
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.883
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest catalyst I think I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever experienced because there was </v>

497
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 2>nowhere to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

498
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:44.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a mirror to yourself,</v>

499
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't distract myself in any way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was nobody else there that</v>

501
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.560
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like the enormity of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in my own presence was,</v>

502
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was overwhelming enormity.</v>

503
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's again,</v>

504
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>quite difficult to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

505
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:06.304
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all live our lives and I </v>

506
00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 2>certainly used to in a way where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounce off other people.</v>

507
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:15.964
<v Speaker 2>in this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly reading signals off year </v>

509
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 2>in order to get an interpretation of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm behaving,</v>

510
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.950
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the producer next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't,</v>

512
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping up and down.</v>

513
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.751
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

514
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 2>things are going okay so I can continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live my life in this way,</v>

515
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:34.260
<v Speaker 2>strip all of that feedback away so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just you certainly your sense of self is</v>

516
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

517
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:38.524
<v Speaker 2>who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody's giving me any </v>

518
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 2>reflective sense of who I am and almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>vomiting on the bees.</v>

519
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Genuinely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was almost sad because,</v>

520
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept of who I was just evaporated</v>

521
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>and I was scared that she stole all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairs on the end of I thought,</v>

522
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:55.360
<v Speaker 2>who am I?</v>

523
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And then other people provide your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters if there's no feedback,</v>

524
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 1>no bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>

525
00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:01.244
<v Speaker 1>I just had the image Ed of light that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self being like a radiator radiant </v>

526
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.490
<v Speaker 1>radiate in our energy in imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that secret,</v>

527
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never gets bounced back.</v>

528
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It's limitless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's infinite.</v>

529
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Once I met this man in America is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy.</v>

530
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it was around the Co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

531
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and he said once there's only so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon a man can stand either.</v>

532
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.533
<v Speaker 1>If there's just endless horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going on forever and no one's </v>

533
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 1>telling You who you are and you start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think as you were saying,</v>

534
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 1>how am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens next?</v>

535
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I did.</v>

536
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to say that the penny dropped </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the island,</v>

537
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was afterwards.</v>

538
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 2>But for you going from extreme anguish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone's on that island.</v>

539
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a knife edge of,</v>

540
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.103
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so filming a project for the </v>

541
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 2>discovery channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

542
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I was also going through this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation,</v>

543
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.183
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

544
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 2>extreme effects of being put in sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>solitary confinement.</v>

545
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Solitary confinement is a punishment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a prison for a reason.</v>

546
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:57.621
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

547
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>

548
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.683
<v Speaker 2>I came off the island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any sort of decompression </v>

549
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 2>therapy or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then about a year later was meant to</v>

550
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 2>be filming another series for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for discovery.</v>

551
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying.</v>

552
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:09.584
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

553
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my courage.</v>

554
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 2>It was through the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

555
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.940
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long story short,</v>

556
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 2>but I went into therapy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

557
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I found out because he invariably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do go through therapy,</v>

558
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 2>get this sort of terminology for certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and what I,</v>

559
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 2>the way I've lived my life they term as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflected sense of self.</v>

560
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 2>But what they tried to engender with </v>
<v Speaker 2>emea was my own sense of self.</v>

561
00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 2>So united.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you okay.</v>

562
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the concept of there being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon being you can only take so merge</v>

563
00:25:39.401 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the isolation being so enormous.</v>

564
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.710
<v Speaker 2>It's only because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

565
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.713
<v Speaker 2>I could only feel comfortable when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting reflected sensitive self if you </v>

566
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 2>have sense of self is coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>

567
00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:52.904
<v Speaker 2>Because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had just started developing a moral </v>

568
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:55.964
<v Speaker 2>compass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 2>if I was to steal your pen and walk out </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

570
00:25:59.151 --> 00:25:59.984
<v Speaker 2>it's not a big thing but I wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it anymore because it won't feel good </v>

571
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 2>about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't matter whether you're new</v>

572
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:05.954
<v Speaker 2>or whether like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now live my life in a really honest </v>

573
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:09.284
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think having to strip it back and </v>

574
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:11.714
<v Speaker 2>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work out who I was was about what I </v>

575
00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>stand for as well.</v>

576
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 2>So I won't steal off you and I won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheat and I won't lie.</v>

577
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.583
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the only true way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually really know who you are as a </v>

578
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:25.820
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what anyone else knows</v>

579
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 2>or understands or can find out or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

580
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:29.840
<v Speaker 2>And I now go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

581
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I can sit here knowing who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that I've now emotionally mature</v>

582
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 2>enough to I have a wife and have a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that because I know who I</v>

583
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:38.804
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if it was all based on how I </v>

584
00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 2>think I'm coming across to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes extraordinarily complicated</v>

585
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:45.774
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was in this chap and I would </v>

586
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 2>honestly say that I walked the amazon so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other people would say to me,</v>

587
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking incredibly tough,</v>

588
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.410
<v Speaker 2>tough because they told me I would</v>

589
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 1>investment in a way it's bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so many people do live their life in</v>

590
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>

591
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from that true sense of self,</v>

592
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to dig down deep to find</v>

593
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 1>out who you are and what you do stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

594
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a thing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

595
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:12.024
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a thing called </v>

596
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 1>codependency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:14.544
<v Speaker 1>like in 12 step circles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that your identity is a meshed </v>

598
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.960
<v Speaker 1>with other people's identity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of you.</v>

599
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.803
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing you just described of like </v>

600
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 1>needing the feedback and approval of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

601
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we have a culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fueled on that,</v>

602
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's running on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>

603
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:31.320
<v Speaker 1>What do I want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

604
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I am my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am my shoes,</v>

605
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I am my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not.</v>

606
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:36.570
<v Speaker 1>My wife thinks of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just describing myself now.</v>

607
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.403
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my journey has been about having like </v>

608
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 1>becoming an addict and haven't let go of</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

609
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to then behaviors that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was addicted to them.</v>

610
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Ways of treating people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 1>all these things have had to be sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly let go of.</v>

612
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.610
<v Speaker 1>What you realize is those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a job for you.</v>

613
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 1>They're holding you together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

614
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated in the way that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicalized and extreme eyes,</v>

615
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.310
<v Speaker 1>if that's a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I like those,</v>

616
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.950
<v Speaker 1>that principle by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.793
<v Speaker 1>like what say data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're saying the whole of the </v>

618
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 1>island experience was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't bring about tiffany.</v>

619
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>You came back from the island and sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of had a mental breakdown.</v>

620
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:10.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

621
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.760
<v Speaker 2>crikey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think being kind to myself,</v>

622
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I would have had to be pretty superhuman</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to do all of that self evaluation</v>

623
00:28:17.751 --> 00:28:18.584
<v Speaker 2>and come to those sort of aha moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and film program for discovery channel </v>

624
00:28:22.191 --> 00:28:24.980
<v Speaker 2>and find food and water and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

625
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.280
<v Speaker 2>There was only so much I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it opened a can of worms,</v>

626
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.563
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't manage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't manage to come to any sort of </v>

627
00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:33.794
<v Speaker 2>massive life conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm certainly not critical if </v>

628
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 2>you decide if you made a real mess of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>

629
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

630
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.350
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it again,</v>

631
00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:43.184
<v Speaker 2>because people who said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that Ireland was conducive to </v>

632
00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you being able to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no better mistakes.</v>

633
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've plentiful because you had coconuts</v>

634
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:50.534
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you make such a meal of it and </v>

635
00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:55.330
<v Speaker 2>yet you've clearly never been isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you?</v>

636
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And cranky some people manage it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

637
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:58.154
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's ocean rowers who go longer than </v>

638
00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I spent on the island and have absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.710
<v Speaker 2>problem is with falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must</v>

640
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.620
<v Speaker 1>be very strongly connected to purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and direction.</v>

641
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.483
<v Speaker 1>I reckon the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily since obviously purely </v>

642
00:29:10.781 --> 00:29:14.920
<v Speaker 1>speculative in my sense in except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this yet another micro example once I to</v>

643
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:15.754
<v Speaker 1>do this stunt where it's a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards off of a 30 foot feeling into </v>

644
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:19.900
<v Speaker 1>some crash mats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

645
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:20.734
<v Speaker 1>And I was so scared of doing it that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way I could persuade myself to do </v>

646
00:29:23.621 --> 00:29:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it was by focusing on the small details </v>
<v Speaker 1>of put your foot there.</v>

647
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Then put there and do tell him exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the stunt man told me in that </v>

648
00:29:31.511 --> 00:29:34.970
<v Speaker 1>moment with my religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do these things and that way that</v>

649
00:29:34.971 --> 00:29:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the fear could be navigated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinates of instruction.</v>

650
00:29:38.411 --> 00:29:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I've been offered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on that island,</v>

651
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 1>the way you what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you like?</v>

652
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.593
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking possibly the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you act to find food and keep yourself </v>

653
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 1>alive would have been in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structuring the experience,</v>

654
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.220
<v Speaker 1>giving you st hold onto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>

655
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely bang on and </v>

656
00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:56.690
<v Speaker 2>actually that's I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wear,</v>

657
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.560
<v Speaker 2>what I came to thInk afterwards is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't have a,</v>

658
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.980
<v Speaker 2>a lateral g,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 2>journey from a to b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't anything to strive for.</v>

660
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:04.684
<v Speaker 2>It was literally your plankton and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ireland and you've got to with yourself </v>

661
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and there is nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no time pressure.</v>

662
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:11.200
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 2>the no desperation to get food because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all around you.</v>

664
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was part of the problem.</v>

665
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't about achieving anything.</v>

666
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>This is about you just becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with yourself.</v>

667
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you candidly what coping </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms city developed?</v>

668
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.700
<v Speaker 1>BecauSe I know that like for me it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be,</v>

669
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.553
<v Speaker 1>that'd be obsessive about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think masturbation would become an </v>

670
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:30.154
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I would find things that were </v>

671
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:34.610
<v Speaker 1>like controlling my states of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were there things,</v>

672
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 1>because you said he vomited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

673
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 1>that was obviously very physicalized did</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like.</v>

674
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a very plain and roots </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

675
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 1>so I saw on ebay masturbation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he did,</v>

676
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:43.774
<v Speaker 1>things like that become that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I can tell you that or did </v>

677
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 1>that quickly become quite redundant?</v>

678
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's tackle that one first.</v>

679
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.123
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the one that interests me and I </v>

680
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:53.164
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't masturbate once in the ocean </v>

681
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:59.810
<v Speaker 2>and so it didn't occur to me one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're malnourished,</v>

682
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 2>your testosterone goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You aren't thinking in that way.</v>

683
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether it's something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with times of famine.</v>

684
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.913
<v Speaker 2>People weren't procreating because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't enough food around so that it </v>

685
00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>doesn't affect your libido.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

686
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Although it would've been a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>distraction.</v>

687
00:31:18.641 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You're roy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

688
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I kind of put it out of my brain as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

689
00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

690
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine this.</v>

691
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

692
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Studying for my a levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

693
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I would have done quite a lot and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can eat it.</v>

694
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.510
<v Speaker 2>You feel grabby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

695
00:31:32.511 --> 00:31:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Have yOu been doing that all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really want that to be the,</v>

696
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus of my,</v>

697
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.420
<v Speaker 2>of my paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man alone</v>

698
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.423
<v Speaker 3>with god now type for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those coconuts together and this </v>

699
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 3>seashell here</v>

700
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.433
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I did because I was so </v>

701
00:31:56.301 --> 00:32:00.020
<v Speaker 2>scared of spending time on my own and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending time with myself.</v>

702
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

703
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.870
<v Speaker 2>this is a really crude way of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very involved or uninvolved,</v>

704
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.500
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't do It today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I made my self so busy that I didn't</v>

705
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:12.690
<v Speaker 2>have time to sit with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

706
00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I decided I'd build a shelter and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally say,</v>

707
00:32:15.781 --> 00:32:16.141
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

708
00:32:16.141 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I could get up in the morning and I make</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a little cup of tea of on,</v>

709
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.203
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow 15 minutes for that and then I'm </v>

710
00:32:21.301 --> 00:32:22.134
<v Speaker 2>going to go to work and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend two hours at work and then at mid </v>

711
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.870
<v Speaker 2>morning on a comeback and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiebreaker and I literally scheduled out</v>

712
00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:30.270
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't have any time.</v>

713
00:32:30.271 --> 00:32:31.104
<v Speaker 2>And reflectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely think that's because I </v>

714
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:34.794
<v Speaker 2>was so scared of those times when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just reflecting when I was just sitting </v>

715
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:39.390
<v Speaker 2>with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

716
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 2>I kept myself extraordinarily busy</v>

717
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>to get around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want your survival technique,</v>

718
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 1>it mentally busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

719
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

720
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 1>When you did find yourself alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

721
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 1>what was the quality of the fear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the,</v>

722
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear in the light,</v>

723
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:56.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you think?</v>

724
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a good enough person.</v>

725
00:32:57.831 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I made mistakes when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>

726
00:32:59.961 --> 00:33:00.794
<v Speaker 1>I hate most of what was sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the frightening things that </v>

727
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 1>happened in your mind?</v>

728
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

729
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 2>this is far from a sub story too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's got their own story.</v>

730
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got stuff that gives some </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

731
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.080
<v Speaker 2>last year with a knife and familiar was </v>
<v Speaker 2>adoption.</v>

732
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid and um,</v>

733
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand this for many years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got up to buy very,</v>

734
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.403
<v Speaker 2>very loving middle class family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got sent to a good school and I have </v>

735
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a sob story to however,</v>

736
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a theory that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

737
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>why do you think you have to keep saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a sob story?</v>

738
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.173
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm not as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to maple sympathy and </v>

739
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I'm telling him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling it because it's,</v>

740
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.950
<v Speaker 2>I think because it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

741
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.110
<v Speaker 2>it kind of all doesn't make sense unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

742
00:33:47.111 --> 00:33:47.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on.</v>

743
00:33:47.711 --> 00:33:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why were you insecure?</v>

744
00:33:49.241 --> 00:33:50.074
<v Speaker 2>Why did you need to prove these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and personally I think that came from </v>

745
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:52.840
<v Speaker 2>adoption.</v>

746
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

747
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.690
<v Speaker 2>can you explain it quite briefly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos?</v>

748
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.180
<v Speaker 2>It is a theory that a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's born to move the,</v>

749
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.103
<v Speaker 2>the biggest trauma it could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience did the equivalent of death </v>

750
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:05.744
<v Speaker 2>is being separated from his mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it can't feed itself and it </v>

751
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 2>can't do anything to separate those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

752
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 2>On a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very core level,</v>

753
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:14.563
<v Speaker 2>you are experienced the trauma of death </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then your whole life Builds upon </v>

754
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:18.704
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that insecurity of being abandoned </v>

755
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:21.074
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had huge abandonment issues and </v>

756
00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 2>that would spill out and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways,</v>

757
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and you know,</v>

758
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>getting expelled for minor acts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vandalism to in my twenties,</v>

759
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:32.650
<v Speaker 2>in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

760
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.920
<v Speaker 2>drinking and getting into trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 2>plays and bits and bobs like that.</v>

761
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think of course every man's got,</v>

762
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:40.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone and every young man spills </v>

763
00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:46.360
<v Speaker 2>over and gets into trouble and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just shows spirit.</v>

764
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.580
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deeper insecurity,</v>

765
00:34:48.581 --> 00:34:49.414
<v Speaker 2>the reason I needed to go to the amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I needed to do something so </v>

766
00:34:52.001 --> 00:34:56.140
<v Speaker 2>big is because my insecurity was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so deep.</v>

767
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I suppose I just genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:34:59.110 --> 00:34:59.943
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole concept of not really knowing </v>

769
00:35:01.511 --> 00:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>who you are and not knowing what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand for.</v>

770
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd do anything for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dare me to do anything.</v>

771
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I literally do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no boundaries and you know,</v>

772
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:09.100
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.040
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just like,</v>

774
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.920
<v Speaker 2>they're scary because they will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

775
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything new.</v>

776
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I definitely fell into that category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sends you understand things like this.</v>

777
00:35:19.301 --> 00:35:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I think I say it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sob stories,</v>

778
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:23.830
<v Speaker 2>because once you understand your </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

779
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.083
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a chapter in your life and I </v>

780
00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:29.794
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't actually trade and any of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all the money in the world because </v>

781
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.803
<v Speaker 2>it's made me who I am today and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have achieved what I've </v>

782
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:36.534
<v Speaker 2>achieved in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably if it stayed in the same phone </v>

783
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 2>and been brought up in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional way.</v>

784
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:44.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's face it,</v>

785
00:35:44.441 --> 00:35:45.274
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a waste of energy to be anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than happy with everything that's </v>

786
00:35:47.921 --> 00:35:49.780
<v Speaker 2>happened to us because it's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

787
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:52.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but therefore it's just a chapter in the</v>

788
00:35:52.421 --> 00:35:53.254
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

789
00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 1>It was probably a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

790
00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.970
<v Speaker 1>it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became your gift.</v>

791
00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 1>The wound became your gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage,</v>

792
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the damage of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said it using your words to read.</v>

793
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.220
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing that could have happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to baby.</v>

794
00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It can be separated from the mother that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you.</v>

795
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And curiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life's agenda becomes,</v>

796
00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:16.100
<v Speaker 1>can I survive alone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question naked on island.</v>

797
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any doubt that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of,</v>

798
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self so,</v>

799
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 2>so fulfilled prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

800
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

801
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Luck and attempt to resolve the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drama of your personal metaphors.</v>

802
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am abandoned.</v>

803
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:34.794
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm abandoned I need to survive </v>

804
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:36.940
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I.</v>

805
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.403
<v Speaker 2>And then to do that in front of however </v>
<v Speaker 2>many $95 million people on discovery </v>

806
00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:42.730
<v Speaker 2>channel as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

807
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.760
<v Speaker 2>It was so deep that I somehow needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sometimes,</v>

808
00:36:45.761 --> 00:36:47.610
<v Speaker 2>which I haven't really quite got to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of this way.</v>

809
00:36:47.611 --> 00:36:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I need to do these things publicly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

810
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

811
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.713
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fully understand that famous and it's </v>

812
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.420
<v Speaker 2>a folly quite frankly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

813
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.960
<v Speaker 2>and not a purpose within it within </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

814
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

815
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I did want to do it on a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:03.791
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be.</v>

817
00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Would you be able to see it as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just an intern.</v>

818
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.191
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

819
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a person who's got the skills </v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive and survive,</v>

820
00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:11.654
<v Speaker 1>but if you interesting that you raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point that it was about community </v>

821
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.553
<v Speaker 1>and about connection and about possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>about exhibition or demonstration and I </v>

822
00:37:20.711 --> 00:37:24.710
<v Speaker 1>mean in a way perhaps all of us have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of need to be loved.</v>

823
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.573
<v Speaker 1>This needs to be connected and certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us have the need to somehow </v>

824
00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:33.960
<v Speaker 1>resolve the drama of our circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That drama of our childhood.</v>

825
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I must become this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must solve there.</v>

826
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 2>She does a another again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a therapy sort of,</v>

827
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay terminology.</v>

828
00:37:41.601 --> 00:37:42.434
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

829
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.983
<v Speaker 2>does this include developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>immaturity where you don't self parent </v>

830
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:47.404
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I definitely think I fell into that </v>

831
00:37:48.671 --> 00:37:50.160
<v Speaker 2>category so I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.093
<v Speaker 2>drive my car at absolute maximum speed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the motorway because there was no </v>

833
00:37:53.651 --> 00:37:56.710
<v Speaker 2>version of myself kicking in and we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different parts of our personality.</v>

834
00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:59.050
<v Speaker 2>But the adult version of myself wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick in again.</v>

835
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And this is not a terribly good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

836
00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:05.210
<v Speaker 2>when you've had however many pints in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people would go to,</v>

837
00:38:05.211 --> 00:38:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had enough.</v>

838
00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to bed and go home,</v>

839
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.000
<v Speaker 2>whereas that and that never kicked into </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

840
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.863
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and apparently there is a psychological </v>

841
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.480
<v Speaker 2>term for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

842
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not far off from codependency,</v>

843
00:38:16.551 --> 00:38:17.384
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same sort of thing which is </v>

844
00:38:18.891 --> 00:38:22.460
<v Speaker 2>literally just living in this childlike </v>
<v Speaker 2>state thinking that,</v>

845
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:24.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still be abandoned thinking that</v>

846
00:38:24.501 --> 00:38:25.334
<v Speaker 2>you need to almost be so volatile that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can ever reject you because you </v>

847
00:38:27.631 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 2>are rejecting them or by your outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

848
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

849
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing that has enabled me in</v>

850
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:35.304
<v Speaker 2>recent years because I got married two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and her little baby about six </v>

851
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:38.374
<v Speaker 2>months ago and I have no worries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a great dad and a great </v>

852
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:41.861
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

853
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

854
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.953
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that at the moment and don't </v>

855
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>doubt myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

856
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.043
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've come through this whole </v>

857
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:48.604
<v Speaker 2>journey because I genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meditate every day and part of my </v>

858
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 2>meditation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is literally,</v>

859
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.333
<v Speaker 2>it's called self parenting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's literally holding my own hand </v>

860
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 2>through life really rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglecting the,</v>

861
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how most people go,</v>

862
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 2>like british people especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like self love is quite a cringy</v>

863
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:08.900
<v Speaker 2>term isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

864
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 2>americans might say a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but british people,</v>

865
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to talk about self love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:14.194
<v Speaker 2>they take the piss out of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're far more comfortable putting </v>

867
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:16.924
<v Speaker 2>themselves down or taking the piss out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of themselves and they are loving </v>

868
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:20.284
<v Speaker 2>themselves and I've had to do it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of visualization when I meditate </v>

869
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 2>each day and it's just like looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>after myself,</v>

870
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 2>being kind to myself.</v>

871
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And that then enables me to stand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go,</v>

872
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 2>rIght,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my values,</v>

873
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking after myself and then I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely in life go look,</v>

874
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not lying to an or not harming </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

875
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean a really good position to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

876
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 2>he loved my wife and look after my child</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of stuff.</v>

877
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.090
<v Speaker 2>When did you start the meditation again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a therapy thing.</v>

878
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:46.924
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was offered whatever the medication </v>

879
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 2>was at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>

880
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.750
<v Speaker 2>but at what point your life is by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way as well.</v>

881
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.593
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't continue filming for </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery channel because I had </v>

882
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.413
<v Speaker 2>essentially a mini breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a year after coming off the island </v>

883
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 2>for 60 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done the island,</v>

884
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Speaker 2>the islands of success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come back and then when you get back</v>

885
00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 2>to normal domestic life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's sort of hits you.</v>

886
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 2>What was that experienced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was happening in your mind and life</v>

887
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.223
<v Speaker 2>then?</v>

888
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I was in at the time a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad relationship.</v>

889
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.370
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

890
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first call mode at the end of the </v>

891
00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Ireland experience was to my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

892
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.813
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend and we had an argument and I </v>

893
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:27.124
<v Speaker 2>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that she's having a go </v>

894
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:33.361
<v Speaker 2>at me 60 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that relationship,</v>

895
00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

896
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

897
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.690
<v Speaker 2>it was absolutely notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back and um,</v>

898
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I think with hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:45.724
<v Speaker 2>tv is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a scary thing that you go to </v>

900
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.240
<v Speaker 2>discovery channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

901
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put myself under the item </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 60 days.</v>

902
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:52.091
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

903
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>could you survive like no knife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

904
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

905
00:40:55.271 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>

906
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:56.974
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they want to embrace it from a </v>

907
00:40:59.080 --> 00:40:59.913
<v Speaker 2>televisual perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to make entertainment for </v>

908
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:02.014
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I struggled that would be really </v>

909
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:03.754
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>

910
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Nobody really went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

911
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:08.540
<v Speaker 2>but is this going to do any damage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

912
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly let alone the sort of physical</v>

913
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.520
<v Speaker 2>thing or that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why dId you choose six days on an island</v>

914
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.413
<v Speaker 2>alone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think I was forever sort of </v>

915
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:22.894
<v Speaker 2>gravitating towards an experience where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I really genuinely had to know that I </v>

916
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 2>could look after myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it wasn't abandoned that thing.</v>

917
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it was me needing to know that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was capable of,</v>

918
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of survIving on their own.</v>

919
00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:36.700
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think that's the end state </v>
<v Speaker 2>in life.</v>

920
00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:37.534
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone can be as independent and as </v>

921
00:41:38.381 --> 00:41:41.770
<v Speaker 2>they like and have as many survival </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills as ray mears,</v>

922
00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.643
<v Speaker 2>but that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you a happy person does </v>

923
00:41:45.271 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

924
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.663
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to come through to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state where I was confident enough in </v>

925
00:41:48.961 --> 00:41:50.850
<v Speaker 2>myself as a person too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

926
00:41:50.851 --> 00:41:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open my heart and,</v>

927
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and embrace the people around me.</v>

928
00:41:54.061 --> 00:41:56.040
<v Speaker 2>But I think I need to do one first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>

929
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.280
<v Speaker 1>she got back and you'd have a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental breakdown and you're like,</v>

930
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you have this argument with your then </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner for africans.</v>

931
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That relationship breaks up and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone</v>

932
00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 2>longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

933
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.223
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you liked being alone would be odd </v>

934
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:15.930
<v Speaker 1>for you after you've done 60 days on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>island to think that you're alone.</v>

935
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:16.783
<v Speaker 1>Proof.</v>

936
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I know people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

937
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best times in life have always been </v>

938
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 2>shared moments they've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm completely on my own,</v>

939
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can pick a moment when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

940
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if we're on a run or </v>

941
00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:34.320
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even that isn't.</v>

942
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have your endorphins are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through your mind,</v>

943
00:42:38.321 --> 00:42:39.154
<v Speaker 2>but it's in a certain parameters whereby</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to come home and </v>

944
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:43.630
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that you love and it.</v>

945
00:42:43.631 --> 00:42:44.464
<v Speaker 2>But I think in general you choose to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big moments of your life with the </v>

946
00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:48.874
<v Speaker 2>people that you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you choose to spend millennium </v>

947
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.980
<v Speaker 2>christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new year's eve with you know,</v>

948
00:42:52.981 --> 00:42:56.110
<v Speaker 2>your best mates or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what life's about for</v>

949
00:42:56.111 --> 00:42:56.831
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family,</v>

950
00:42:56.831 --> 00:42:57.910
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of stuff.</v>

951
00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 2>But you've got to get yourself right </v>
<v Speaker 2>first</v>

952
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.550
<v Speaker 1>to have a meaningful input to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and friends.</v>

953
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:05.384
<v Speaker 1>I think my book about 12 steps and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>12 steps themselves from which the book </v>

954
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 1>is derived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how you go on a journey to be</v>

955
00:43:12.531 --> 00:43:13.364
<v Speaker 1>able to be part of a community by </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing these issues without going </v>

956
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:20.243
<v Speaker 1>around Ireland for 60 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by going in yourself and knowing </v>

957
00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:23.634
<v Speaker 1>that you're probably being motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand and </v>

958
00:43:26.491 --> 00:43:27.324
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to drink and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you have to take drugs and that's </v>

959
00:43:28.711 --> 00:43:29.544
<v Speaker 1>why you have to gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or that's why you're shopping too much </v>

960
00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:32.310
<v Speaker 1>or that's why you're in bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

961
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:35.100
<v Speaker 1>so that's why you're doing your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like because you've never ever</v>

962
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.143
<v Speaker 1>asked yourself the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never stopped and done something </v>

963
00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:40.860
<v Speaker 1>as transformative or ritualistic as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being alone.</v>

964
00:43:40.861 --> 00:43:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the idea of isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a religious idea,</v>

965
00:43:43.831 --> 00:43:45.900
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in a monastic cultures,</v>

966
00:43:45.901 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>and I bet in them aboriginal cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were they able to go?</v>

967
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did sound a bit like that.</v>

968
00:43:50.011 --> 00:43:50.844
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a 15 year old boys sloughing off </v>

969
00:43:52.551 --> 00:43:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and talked to survive.</v>

970
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.491
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>

971
00:43:54.491 --> 00:43:55.324
<v Speaker 2>They go walkabout and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the absolute aboriginal </v>

972
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.583
<v Speaker 2>traditions is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to go off as a young man on your own </v>

973
00:44:01.511 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and spend extended periods of time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bush on your own and you know,</v>

974
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>that is a part of how they evolve into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

975
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's no coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So either I think,</v>

976
00:44:12.291 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

977
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need to sit there without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the distractions.</v>

978
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.463
<v Speaker 2>Addictions are not anything in life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>distracts you from just being able to </v>

979
00:44:21.011 --> 00:44:23.140
<v Speaker 2>sit with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's hugely important.</v>

980
00:44:23.141 --> 00:44:25.760
<v Speaker 2>If you don't quite know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've always like,</v>

981
00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.793
<v Speaker 2>people are so busy at work for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they come home and because </v>

982
00:44:29.881 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 2>there is that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in theory,</v>

983
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 2>my brain gets switched off now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that will be.</v>

984
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Or I could stop thinking about stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a bit scary.</v>

985
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 2>They'll have a glass of wine and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

986
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I need either to be stupidly busy or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>numb my brain,</v>

987
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 2>but the other bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.990
<v Speaker 2>that actually just sitting in</v>

989
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>and feeling how I'm genuinely feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'S the scary bit.</v>

990
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.193
<v Speaker 1>Holding reality being in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who was it that during this time of </v>

991
00:44:54.111 --> 00:44:57.260
<v Speaker 1>crisis suggested meditation to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get into that?</v>

992
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:58.123
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

993
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it was a neuro linguistic programming </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady who was operating in called malecon</v>

994
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:08.260
<v Speaker 2>who operated from a little little clinic</v>
<v Speaker 2>in knightsbridge I think at the time.</v>

995
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.153
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really get on with the neuro </v>

996
00:45:13.011 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 2>linguistic programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she goes,</v>

997
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:14.961
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

998
00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 2>this app is for cynics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:45:17.151 --> 00:45:19.310
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called headspace.</v>

1000
00:45:19.311 --> 00:45:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Went by a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who used to come from bristol a thing.</v>

1001
00:45:22.221 --> 00:45:24.170
<v Speaker 2>And he's a sports science guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1002
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.240
<v Speaker 2>he had dodgy part of his life and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>went off and became a,</v>

1003
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:31.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of buddhist monk and spent a huge amount</v>

1004
00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:35.810
<v Speaker 2>of his time actually studying meditation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it has,</v>

1005
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean hezbollah has earned him millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1006
00:45:38.181 --> 00:45:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's big in New York.</v>

1007
00:45:39.351 --> 00:45:39.831
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1008
00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's as big a lot of countries all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1009
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.113
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the meditation without the justice </v>

1010
00:45:45.501 --> 00:45:46.520
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.160
<v Speaker 2>the chanting and singing had an.</v>

1012
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And I needed it to be accessible at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage because if We rewind a few years I</v>

1013
00:45:55.401 --> 00:45:56.234
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very ex military and so I would </v>

1014
00:45:57.251 --> 00:46:00.830
<v Speaker 2>have taken the mickey out of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that I'd be meditating daily,</v>

1015
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now for 10 years ago I would have gone.</v>

1016
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.600
<v Speaker 2>That's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have a pint,</v>

1017
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do believe in god.</v>

1018
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't reAlly like the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious structure put around.</v>

1019
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I believe in something bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I suppose the,</v>

1020
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.220
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my belief is the,</v>

1021
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:21.223
<v Speaker 2>the closest to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I can describe it as the </v>

1022
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:23.510
<v Speaker 2>guy or principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:46:23.511 --> 00:46:24.344
<v Speaker 2>the concept of the earth acting like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living organism and therefore there is </v>

1024
00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:28.334
<v Speaker 2>something positive happening that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than me that is taking things on </v>

1025
00:46:30.981 --> 00:46:31.814
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a positive journey that has an </v>

1026
00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:37.961
<v Speaker 2>interest in things going well and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning together and operating as a,</v>

1027
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.250
<v Speaker 2>as an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a cohesIve unit.</v>

1028
00:46:40.251 --> 00:46:45.251
<v Speaker 2>And I think for me that's not religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's quite a crude way of people</v>

1029
00:46:45.321 --> 00:46:46.154
<v Speaker 2>trying to use the smallest brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the logical brain to actually put sort </v>

1030
00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 2>of parameters on something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't really talk about.</v>

1031
00:46:52.171 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1032
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I believe in something bigger than him.</v>

1033
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 1>There is some sort of harmonious </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection that these aboriginal mentors</v>

1034
00:46:58.201 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>and tutors that you found and made use </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1035
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 1>What is your understanding of what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality is based on?</v>

1036
00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>

1037
00:47:07.271 --> 00:47:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1038
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:10.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they believe that their ancestors</v>

1039
00:47:10.751 --> 00:47:11.584
<v Speaker 2>are still around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think sometimes the way it was </v>

1040
00:47:14.171 --> 00:47:15.004
<v Speaker 2>described to me is that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your life is like if you were a jug </v>

1041
00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 2>of water and you put it in one drop of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water falls out of the jug of water back</v>

1042
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:25.110
<v Speaker 2>into another job at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

1043
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're an individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>entity while you're that drop of water,</v>

1044
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 2>but you're just coming from,</v>

1045
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1046
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the sort of a source and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight by two and,</v>

1047
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's how they feel.</v>

1048
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:39.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly know that jeremy and my </v>

1049
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 1>aboriginal friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1050
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:43.503
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about communicating with the </v>

1051
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 1>ancestors and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1052
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1053
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 1>they walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a foot in,</v>

1054
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 1>in more than one world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1055
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think they believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1056
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they believe in the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces of the planet.</v>

1057
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.403
<v Speaker 1>They don't over complicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's because they don't </v>

1058
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 1>make it cerebral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't use that.</v>

1059
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.440
<v Speaker 1>What's that tangled mind called again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It nando nando parrado.</v>

1060
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a word of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1061
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.253
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a culture that lives in Peru </v>

1062
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 1>minds here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since you've learned all these skills,</v>

1063
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 1>does go in and being isolated or </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable survival programs.</v>

1064
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:22.324
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you continue to make these </v>

1065
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:23.704
<v Speaker 1>very successful programs at these as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as any other bit of kit or a </v>

1066
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:28.414
<v Speaker 1>purse orange personal ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically ensure these knowledge of </v>

1067
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 1>spirit and mind.</v>

1068
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>It's the most powerful to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got as as I would have.</v>

1069
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I used to say the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

1070
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:41.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

1071
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's greater than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the ability to control my state.</v>

1072
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.533
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1073
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:45.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1074
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:46.734
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely spent days and days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>days running around like a headless </v>

1075
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>chicken in survival situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a meal of things,</v>

1076
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:53.283
<v Speaker 1>but the time when you stop and compose </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and meditate that that's when </v>

1077
00:48:55.991 --> 00:48:56.824
<v Speaker 1>it starts going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is one thing thAt people that </v>

1078
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.484
<v Speaker 1>are not surviving in extreme conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn because we are all surviving </v>

1079
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.613
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mountains and terrains and </v>

1080
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 1>tundras of the inner space of the inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1081
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:15.121
<v Speaker 1>And we have to find a way of reflecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow finding an inner tree,</v>

1082
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 1>an inner connection where we can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>repos and like,</v>

1083
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with what you've said about sort</v>

1084
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 1>of conventional religion that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get to access,</v>

1085
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:25.474
<v Speaker 1>get to contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to connection through conventional </v>

1086
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:28.084
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1087
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.373
<v Speaker 1>But I believe that unless we have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of my struggle in my own life is </v>

1088
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:33.874
<v Speaker 1>being able to find a point of access </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and len maintain it because I </v>

1089
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 1>get distracted away from it if I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened or if I get full of desire,</v>

1090
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>like it very hard to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

1091
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.373
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose it's fascinating when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone distills it as you have done </v>

1092
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 1>into obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not obvious.</v>

1093
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of modern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna say epic survival conditions,</v>

1094
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can survive in this extreme.</v>

1095
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.353
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a slightly comical setting </v>

1096
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1097
00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a survival situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dropped off by a tv crew in an</v>

1098
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 1>area where they know there's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some water and there's going to be,</v>

1099
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 1>and you're making an entertaining show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the parameters are survival.</v>

1100
00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:13.654
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of fire without matches </v>

1101
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:15.790
<v Speaker 1>or a lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1102
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:16.624
<v Speaker 1>I've got to find food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is essentially a little snapshot </v>

1103
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:21.900
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just life into glorious technicolor</v>

1104
00:50:21.901 --> 00:50:22.734
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to do all of those </v>

1105
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.054
<v Speaker 1>components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still stressed about will I get </v>

1106
00:50:26.351 --> 00:50:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the right footage to make the program </v>
<v Speaker 1>run</v>

1107
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 2>by worrying about whether I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay next month's mortgage.</v>

1108
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:33.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the normal stuff was still there.</v>

1109
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And therefore I think with the added </v>
<v Speaker 2>component of,</v>

1110
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.943
<v Speaker 2>because obviously directing film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything myself with that component </v>

1111
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 2>and surviving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's huge control freak,</v>

1112
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.880
<v Speaker 2>a massive control freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly have been,</v>

1113
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

1114
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore meditation's really necessary.</v>

1115
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I'd just tie myself in knots </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and it would all become too</v>

1116
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:54.883
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be able to do the sustained </v>

1117
00:50:57.141 --> 00:51:02.141
<v Speaker 2>periods of isolation or even separation </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that you are a father and husband?</v>

1118
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I've got a new show started filming in </v>
<v Speaker 2>january,</v>

1119
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:10.940
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to have to do mate that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually got a another show,</v>

1120
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.400
<v Speaker 2>which I think they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>

1121
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Allowed to say it involves my </v>

1122
00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:17.330
<v Speaker 2>family involved In both of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1123
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>which could be very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing.</v>

1124
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.204
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that gets made because one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things I think my fantasies </v>

1125
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 2>version of this is it must be so amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know that it's society falls apart on</v>

1126
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it feels like it might or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue that you'd be out guy,</v>

1127
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:31.664
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>

1128
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 2>we're going here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do this,</v>

1129
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1130
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must be amazing.</v>

1131
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1132
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I actually quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1133
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do gain a little confidence that</v>

1134
00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I have known that confidence of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to go into the word,</v>

1135
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 2>take two bits of work together and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to make a fire.</v>

1136
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a cool thIng.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to say the mickey.</v>

1137
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:47.174
<v Speaker 2>So much of sort of geeks who watch star </v>
<v Speaker 2>trek and make fire by friction and used </v>

1138
00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:51.900
<v Speaker 2>to take the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1139
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 2>take the piss out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1140
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 2>having gone through that and I'm in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>mls cynical person now,</v>

1141
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a really nice wholesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic skill.</v>

1142
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:00.883
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it would be a lovely </v>

1143
00:52:01.641 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to know that.</v>

1144
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.093
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to be to know that this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to survive because I feel like </v>

1145
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 2>possibly the sense of abandoned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability that you described in your</v>

1146
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:12.524
<v Speaker 2>own personal drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us know our life is held </v>

1147
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 2>together by the power of other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

1148
00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1149
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 2>we need the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need the clothes.</v>

1150
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.023
<v Speaker 2>We need to say we need the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to advertise and we need the </v>

1151
00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>

1152
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.780
<v Speaker 2>We need the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't confront the banks.</v>

1153
00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:27.614
<v Speaker 2>Bring down the bloody government will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead in 10 minutes because there's no </v>

1154
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 2>one can see in the american survivalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1155
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:33.723
<v Speaker 2>The sheriff that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a sense of we want to be </v>

1156
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:35.984
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to live tribally wanting to be </v>

1157
00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 2>connected to nature in an hour like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1158
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:41.204
<v Speaker 2>So that's the impetus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no language to do it and </v>

1159
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:45.074
<v Speaker 2>there's no culture to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly no way of a </v>

1160
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.293
<v Speaker 2>correlate in a or conflate in the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is a spiritual as well as </v>

1161
00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 2>physical endeavor to be able to survive </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

1162
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you hit the nail on the head and</v>

1163
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.213
<v Speaker 2>think that's why my shows are successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because people want to vicariously </v>

1164
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:05.480
<v Speaker 2>live in this world where they don't need</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bank there.</v>

1165
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.150
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to go to the supermarket</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to buy the food.</v>

1166
00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 2>They want to be able to do it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1167
00:53:09.831 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>And yet you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no,</v>

1168
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't achieve that in this world.</v>

1169
00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't go off the grid really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the uk is it.</v>

1170
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:16.603
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly difficult to do so all </v>

1171
00:53:17.721 --> 00:53:20.920
<v Speaker 2>sorts of alternative cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1172
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 2>think that they can survive without </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1173
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And certainly in the uk,</v>

1174
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't</v>

1175
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.800
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're owned.</v>

1176
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also feel that if you try to do it,</v>

1177
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 1>forces would step in and prevent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1178
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 1>the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean travel is obviously a looked down</v>

1179
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:38.800
<v Speaker 1>upon and by a huge number of parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society aren't they?</v>

1180
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not contributing to the state,</v>

1181
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:41.454
<v Speaker 1>but we've got around culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to do this and making </v>

1182
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 1>their own choices and they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a part of the mainstream.</v>

1183
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think inherently a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a bit of that in them anyway.</v>

1184
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Those of us that don't have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>monumental will to survive an ambition </v>

1185
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.020
<v Speaker 1>that you have expressed and six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1186
00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved such success for what do,</v>

1187
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.500
<v Speaker 1>what can we do to access and learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your trials and your journeys?</v>

1188
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:09.970
<v Speaker 1>What would you suggest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even someone like me,</v>

1189
00:54:09.971 --> 00:54:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean my mate matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's such a fan,</v>

1190
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great fan of yours.</v>

1191
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:14.543
<v Speaker 1>You a great hero of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like staying or like we want to do </v>

1192
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:19.074
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going definitely in some suspended </v>

1193
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 1>10 in a private word in essex this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>

1194
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.190
<v Speaker 1>friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturday,</v>

1195
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:27.024
<v Speaker 1>and sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm debating whether or not to go </v>

1196
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it to my wife and she said,</v>

1197
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go.</v>

1198
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.220
<v Speaker 1>You should go to bloody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>

1199
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1200
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:36.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1201
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 1>like easy that we should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1202
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:38.963
<v Speaker 1>Some of my life has got to be like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold plunge in the pond moment where </v>

1203
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you're hit with the reality of what life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1204
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Would you suggest that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1205
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:48.443
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really good idea to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of structure a bit of that into your </v>

1206
00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether that's,</v>

1207
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:52.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1208
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:56.520
<v Speaker 1>walking in the peak district at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend or wherever it is getting out of</v>

1209
00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>london.</v>

1210
00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can do it in london,</v>

1211
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:00.144
<v Speaker 1>but it's really difficult to step out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that heady space when you were in </v>

1212
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:05.574
<v Speaker 1>london.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just so much energy with the </v>

1213
00:55:07.111 --> 00:55:07.944
<v Speaker 1>concentration of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be a bit like that </v>

1214
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 1>aboriginal man san shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be like that on him.</v>

1215
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:14.710
<v Speaker 1>There's times 12 million winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally.</v>

1216
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the energy.</v>

1217
00:55:16.591 --> 00:55:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And I hadn't said a word in that car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet he,</v>

1218
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:19.913
<v Speaker 1>he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just cannot think with all that noise </v>

1219
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 1>going on in your head a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloody jed.</v>

1220
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is a bit,</v>

1221
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but It was quite cool as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's welcome.</v>

1222
00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.293
<v Speaker 1>I think you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us need to get out in order to </v>

1223
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 1>get that clarity of thought or to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop thinking.</v>

1224
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think london confuses it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or very dense populations do confuse it.</v>

1225
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make space for yourself in some way,</v>

1226
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:44.550
<v Speaker 1>whether it's sort of like a walk in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick some way of interacting with nature</v>

1227
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.650
<v Speaker 1>in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very literal way.</v>

1228
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you thInk of this quote?</v>

1229
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:49.674
<v Speaker 1>I think about it sometimes chesterton </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to the truly adventurous man would </v>

1230
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.873
<v Speaker 1>it likes an interest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying this as a dick with </v>

1231
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1232
00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trekking across planes and </v>

1233
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 1>climbing mountains would simply jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>over these next door neighbors fence,</v>

1234
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:06.890
<v Speaker 1>meanIng I suppose that adventure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially all around us and what we're</v>

1235
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.733
<v Speaker 1>bound by in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's convention and we all live in </v>

1236
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:12.730
<v Speaker 1>restricted space that you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1237
00:56:12.731 --> 00:56:13.564
<v Speaker 1>that what you have learned as a literal </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivalist has had so many are evident </v>

1238
00:56:16.571 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>spiritual connotations and it's driven </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the direction of the spirit.</v>

1239
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.753
<v Speaker 1>That there are ways of crossing </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries that these techniques could </v>

1240
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 1>be applied to the way that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you curious about the way this could</v>

1241
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 1>affect societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've learned?</v>

1242
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1243
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1244
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that need to go and climb a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain or,</v>

1245
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1246
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conquer something that hasn't been </v>

1247
00:56:38.981 --> 00:56:39.814
<v Speaker 2>achieved before as much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone needs meaning in their </v>

1248
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:45.070
<v Speaker 2>life obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1249
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:45.904
<v Speaker 2>from having a baby recently as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that suddenly it just changes your </v>

1250
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:50.374
<v Speaker 2>perspective on life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not the center of the world </v>

1251
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something really meaningful that yes,</v>

1252
00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit of a cliche and everyone says</v>

1253
00:56:57.071 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 2>that your life changes when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>

1254
00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.314
<v Speaker 2>but for me it has all of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I still do and I'm not going to stop </v>

1255
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:03.544
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adventures feels like it has gotten </v>

1256
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.130
<v Speaker 2>meaning because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1257
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:06.964
<v Speaker 2>there's an analogy that our is like or </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship is like ships in the </v>

1258
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.574
<v Speaker 2>harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like built in a harbor and it's </v>

1259
00:57:13.571 --> 00:57:14.404
<v Speaker 2>safe in the harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't build a ship to stay in </v>

1260
00:57:16.351 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>their heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to go out and it has to go on</v>

1261
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.323
<v Speaker 2>journeys and it has to come back again </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's all part and parcel of </v>

1262
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:22.570
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1263
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.440
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to go away and adventures.</v>

1264
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.293
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to go and have experiences </v>

1265
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 2>outside of the nucleus of the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but invariably you're going to come back</v>

1266
00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:31.924
<v Speaker 2>and it makes going on those journeys or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more meaningful because you've got </v>

1267
00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 2>something wholesome and meaningful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to you.</v>

1268
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I think before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's called relationship.</v>

1269
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You're meant to go on a voyage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weren't meant to be a punk,</v>

1270
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but basically was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1271
00:57:46.281 --> 00:57:49.280
<v Speaker 1>So I think I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go and do this campaign.</v>

1272
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.010
<v Speaker 1>We can think what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

1273
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.040
<v Speaker 1>learn some surviving things off you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>

1274
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.670
<v Speaker 1>What should we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we do it.</v>

1275
00:57:56.671 --> 00:57:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Is there some way you can think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>format in that alternative into anything</v>

1276
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:00.763
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1277
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.200
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily for television but </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly for television,</v>

1278
00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but like I just like feel like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would you</v>

1279
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.910
<v Speaker 2>eclipse suggest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a difficult thing to,</v>

1280
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 2>to set up a survival scenario where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go in and teach you if he wants to</v>

1281
00:58:13.401 --> 00:58:14.630
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be all over it.</v>

1282
00:58:14.631 --> 00:58:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Some survival stuff and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then set he to It.</v>

1283
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that's as a two or individually </v>

1284
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:23.120
<v Speaker 2>on your own If you want to do experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>the isolation,</v>

1285
00:58:23.121 --> 00:58:25.610
<v Speaker 2>but as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I really do.</v>

1286
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do wow</v>

1287
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.000
<v Speaker 1>asset real good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clear.</v>

1288
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And is there anything and just to return</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1289
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.313
<v Speaker 1>So it was a simple thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People listen to this podcast to learn </v>

1290
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:37.600
<v Speaker 1>things in a later week here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have been absolutely fantastic.</v>

1291
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this because then like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time I'm doing it,</v>

1292
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking this is all information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing information.</v>

1293
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:45.064
<v Speaker 1>I need this information to other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually actually matt morgan is </v>

1294
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:53.341
<v Speaker 1>actually outside standing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corridor or looking for a nordic.</v>

1295

1297
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It's so under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listeners,</v>

1300
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:07.534
<v Speaker 1>But matt would you.</v>

1301
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:14.520
<v Speaker 1>He can't even get in the bloody studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's elevated stuff.</v>

1302
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.093
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So matt morgan and ed's come and share </v>

1304
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1305
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.913
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not try and pretend that we're </v>

1306
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 1>cool in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I told you I've already told it that</v>

1307
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 1>we're planning to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you are definitely the campaign.</v>

1308
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is you're he.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this was the,</v>

1312
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 1>would be the podcast I would most </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend that you listen to.</v>

1313
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll love it.</v>

1314
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:45.223
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of trials and what sort of </v>

1315
00:59:47.181 --> 00:59:51.230
<v Speaker 1>techniques and tips would you suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people listening to this now should</v>

1316
00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 1>try in our own lives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That without,</v>

1317
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:55.500
<v Speaker 1>as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a monument and adventure?</v>

1318
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me the thing that's helped me</v>

1319
00:59:58.041 --> 00:59:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and I do use it into over situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1320
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and outside is what we've already talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1321
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's meditation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the app that I spoke about,</v>

1322
01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>the headspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1323
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your cultural collateral 10 minutes </v>

1324
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.333
<v Speaker 1>20 pence with promoting genuinely don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>start our own ones that every day we're </v>

1325
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.251
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1326
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:17.084
<v Speaker 1>let's start with taking that time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get him as a guest to have some </v>

1327
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>perspective over being wrapped up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own,</v>

1328
01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>in your own life and being super </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in your own little stories.</v>

1329
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.913
<v Speaker 1>It's just stepping one step Back and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to have a bit of perspective and </v>

1330
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.044
<v Speaker 1>clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's helped me at home in </v>

1331
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>relationship since verbal situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that across the board,</v>

1332
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I just imagine it must be a phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson to know that you can survive,</v>

1333
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that you can survive emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can survive spiritually,</v>

1334
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that you can survive physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1335
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and the importance that you've placed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual component of that.</v>

1336
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And I say I wasn't pushing it in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction as being not much.</v>

1337
01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.043
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't shut up about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we talk about stuff that I know </v>

1338
01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>something about so I can complete in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this chat and.</v>

1339
01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's fantastic match.</v>

1340
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:08.870

<v Speaker 1>here in 87 bivy bags,</v>

1345
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.670

<v Speaker 1>attending in a tent you don't need.</v>

1346
