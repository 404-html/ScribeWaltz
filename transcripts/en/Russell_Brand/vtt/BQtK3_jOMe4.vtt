1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated by how particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like juror number free.</v>

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>She didn't like us by that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>How particular it becomes and that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a sway that person,</v>

4
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>she will be swayed by x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y,</v>

5
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>zed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes very sort of bespoke,</v>

6
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

7
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as when we're picking jurors,</v>

9
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

10
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 2>at least I view him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a certain jurors who I consider</v>

11
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 2>to be fillers</v>

12
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>just go with the flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

13
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to affect</v>

14
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 2>the jury deliberation a one way or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

15
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't worry terribly much about the</v>

16
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:34.520
<v Speaker 2>fillers.</v>

17
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you identify a Filler,</v>

18
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by talking to them?</v>

19
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.711
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's the key attributes of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>filler.</v>

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key attribute of a filler is,</v>

22
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 2>sort of a timid personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't seem to express any views in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of a strong way.</v>

25
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.624
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that sort of mousy person who's </v>

27
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 2>sitting in the corner and you just sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of know,</v>

28
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

30
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>if things get rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want</v>

31
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>void it conflict of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

32
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you want a few of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

34
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to have as many of them as we </v>

35
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>can in 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

36
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need at least one leader.</v>

38
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to leave now with the lead.</v>

39
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:26.704
<v Speaker 1>This guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself from a bisexual continually </v>

41
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>being accused of pushing people down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs I've had just about enough of,</v>

42
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

43
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generally</v>

44
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.551
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to focus in on and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be three or four people,</v>

46
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any group that gets selected,</v>

47
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 2>have 12 that are not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fillers.</v>

48
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

49
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to have various </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees of,</v>

50
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 2>of leadership qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

51
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.024
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all sort of armchair psychology </v>

52
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>

53
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's strictly enough now with social </v>

54
00:01:58.691 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>we get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the resources,</v>

57
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:03.904
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at people's social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media and you get really interesting </v>

58
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 2>insights into their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into their,</v>

59
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways of thinking</v>

60
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they attended that rally.</v>

61
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

62
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

63
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

64
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll get three or four people who </v>

65
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you think these are people who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>really affect the deliberation.</v>

66
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>there's the theater of the case itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the famous staircase or any</v>

68
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's this secondary reality that</v>

69
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:33.634
<v Speaker 1>takes place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>annexed off over there where the 12 </v>

70
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>jurors go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a sense that's,</v>

71
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.773
<v Speaker 1>you can't really can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can influence but not control what </v>

72
00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>takes place there.</v>

73
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 2>So then here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

74
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Peterson case,</v>

75
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 2>where was one juror in particular?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

76
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 2>an older black man who we just got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense all the way through,</v>

77
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.270
<v Speaker 2>was really skeptical of the and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

78
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just rolling his eyes.</v>

79
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

80
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Body language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

81
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

82
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

83
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.603
<v Speaker 2>and it was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody in the courtroom sort </v>

84
00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>of got the same sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

85
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the jury goes out to deliberate in,</v>

86
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 2>in North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not sequestered.</v>

87
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to stay in a hotel or </v>

88
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go home.</v>

89
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.473
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

90
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.323
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over that next weekend on a Saturday </v>

91
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.320
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 2>apparently this juror got stopped by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>

93
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and accused of a driving while </v>

94
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he claimed he wasn't.</v>

95
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got arrested.</v>

96
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we went into court that next Monday </v>

97
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.883
<v Speaker 2>morning and the DA stood up and move to </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse that juror on grounds that the </v>

98
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 2>juror had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

99
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

100
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>resistant to the police that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be angry,</v>

102
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>that he'd gotten arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he couldn't be fair to the state,</v>

103
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and succeeded in getting that you're,</v>

104
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked off the juror who took that </v>

105
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>person's place was a white female about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of Kathleen,</v>

106
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was an engineer,</v>

107
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>which Kathleen also was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

108
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 2>and we found out later and the juror </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

109
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the jury was split at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was I think three guilty,</v>

110
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>three not guilty and six undecided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

111
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 2>and then once a new jury joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to restart the node,</v>

112
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deliberations.</v>

113
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know know quite how they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

114
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 2>but they're supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

115
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 2>and that your ended up being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreperson of the jury,</v>

116
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 2>the one who came on a and she ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>leading the charge to convict Peterson.</v>

117
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

118
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.003
<v Speaker 1>and for all we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deliberately arrested that guy and </v>

119
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing's constructed</v>

120
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

121
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 2>the thought crossed my mind more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>once</v>

122
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>because there's a game because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay member as a game.</v>

123
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>There's so convoluted and so much of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is not explicit.</v>

124
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So much of it is masked necessarily mask</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're subject to influences.</v>

125
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>They're very difficult to account for to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point in fact were not only your own</v>

126
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:14.904
<v Speaker 1>attitude to truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems very sort of actually quite </v>

127
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>gnostic and beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

128
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not my job to ascertain truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my job to serve,</v>

129
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like kind of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and beautiful idea.</v>

130
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 1>In the end it becomes like there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectivity at all,</v>

131
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>only power and how power can exert </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

132
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

133
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.363
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly true in the criminal </v>

134
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

135
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

136
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>we've seen that time and time again with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these exonerations of people,</v>

137
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who spent decades in prison,</v>

138
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 2>the DNA testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>establishes that they weren't guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

141
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:50.434
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did they spend all their time in </v>

142
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

143
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and generally it's because of the of </v>

144
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:02.501
<v Speaker 2>power is because the police decided that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew better.</v>

145
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I knew best and that person was guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

146
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.154
<v Speaker 2>and then tunnel vision sort of kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a combination of arrogance </v>

147
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>and tunnel vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

148
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ignore the evidence that's </v>

150
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:18.464
<v Speaker 2>inconsistent with their own theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're arrogant and they have </v>

151
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:22.350
<v Speaker 2>tunnel vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.203
<v Speaker 2>and they inflate the importance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that is consistent with their </v>

153
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 2>predispositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

154
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 2>it's called confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all suffer from it.</v>

155
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just particularly pernicious in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal justice system</v>

156
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.623
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power kind of admit to its fallibility </v>

157
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>extensively without undermining its </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations.</v>

158
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

159
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.773
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the authority is not infallible,</v>

161
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 2>then it loses its authority and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just choose some other,</v>

162
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:55.270
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

163
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is infallible and</v>

164
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.173
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
