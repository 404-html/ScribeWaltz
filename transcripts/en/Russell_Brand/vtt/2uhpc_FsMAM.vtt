<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

21
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>What is it that made you transition from</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entertainment based life to one,</v>

22
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>based on the psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit therapy,</v>

23
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever this is that you're doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

24
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>what inspired you?</v>

25
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I went to Berkeley when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you say it,</v>

27
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 2>but Berkeley and I never finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I hitchhike through Europe.</v>

28
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I decided what were you doing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place?</v>

29
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I was doing psychology but I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>finished and I just ended up hitchhiking</v>

30
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:32.894
<v Speaker 2>one day and I have nightmares to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>day what my locker combination is </v>

31
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.734
<v Speaker 2>because I left all my books there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to this day I'm still racking my </v>

32
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 2>brains there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the illusion,</v>

33
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.053
<v Speaker 2>they're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to come to Europe to get </v>

34
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>away from my parents a and B.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

35
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>this is pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A classical actress with no talent.</v>

36
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>None,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zilch.</v>

37
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean since high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like 6,000</v>

38
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>people in my school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one,</v>

39
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>not in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>6,000</v>

40
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 2>were in Hello Dolly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I settled.</v>

41
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in production.</v>

42
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>It was a full load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him staring at 5,999</v>

43
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 2>people in Hello Dolly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

44
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you say that?</v>

45
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>My whole life has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>where are they now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've tracked them.</v>

47
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Vengeance against Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

48
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:22.844
<v Speaker 2>against every township high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I went to Berkeley to study </v>

49
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.584
<v Speaker 2>psychology and then I thought I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come to England and become a </v>

50
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>classical actress if you knew how </v>
<v Speaker 2>delusional that was.</v>

51
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 2>So I used to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goes on top.</v>

52
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were one that was much later.</v>

53
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:40.101
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know Evanston was when I was 17.</v>

55
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.143
<v Speaker 2>Then Berkeley was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 mangoes on top girls on top of way </v>

56
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way like a century.</v>

57
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I was 17 girls on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

59
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 30.</v>

60
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of a gap.</v>

61
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So you knew when you went in</v>

62
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.233
<v Speaker 1>early life in academia that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in psychology then it seems </v>

63
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.191
<v Speaker 1>like you pursuit some external glamorous</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and then in Middle East Age,</v>

64
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.263
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're divided between a food for the </v>

65
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:17.054
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't really on your agenda when </v>

66
00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you're 20 and yet a narcissism was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always nagging away.</v>

67
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I know how my father got out of</v>

68
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:26.174
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand why I have this insatiable </v>

69
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>thirst for things that are impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.323
<v Speaker 2>because they said he'll never get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I have this drive to get things </v>

71
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 2>that people say it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had no English accent.</v>

72
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I had no talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough one.</v>

73
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 2>So I went to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hitchhiked.</v>

74
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I sort of sold some marijuana to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane ticket.</v>

75
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.803
<v Speaker 2>Can I say that?</v>

76
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these will be handed to the </v>

77
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 1>authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruby Berkeley.</v>

78
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 2>So they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

79
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I sold that and some girl scout cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to Europe.</v>

80
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I found myself an acting teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

81
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a longer story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

82
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 2>I hitchhiked with somebody from the cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hair.</v>

83
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.410
<v Speaker 2>This is sort of sad because that was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>first taste of Bohemia anarchism and uh,</v>

84
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.403
<v Speaker 1>about what you feel that it is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling that it was a prepackaged and </v>

85
00:04:17.151 --> 00:04:20.270
<v Speaker 1>stage version of Bohemia that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd yourself.</v>

86
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

87
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped him.</v>

88
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

89
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.223
<v Speaker 2>I went with this guy through Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up in Israel where I found </v>

90
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 2>somebody to teach me acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I came back to London,</v>

91
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:37.820
<v Speaker 2>lived in a bedsit for two years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>audition for probably rod is seven times</v>

92
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>and was rejected each time because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

93
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:42.350
<v Speaker 2>they said one of the most grotesque </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditions they'd ever seen.</v>

94
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.863
<v Speaker 1>She Hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ferocious drive for success and for </v>

95
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 1>attention I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying new world.</v>

96
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit in there where you talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being in like a like,</v>

97
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know we're famed,</v>

98
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:56.144
<v Speaker 1>sort of can lead to either it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued upward trajectory or it can </v>

99
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:01.574
<v Speaker 1>become sort of grimly cataclysmic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your anecdote about that shark tank </v>

100
00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>show that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a participant in saying that you know,</v>

101
00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>that there was a sort of an attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who was in bikinis,</v>

102
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.080
<v Speaker 1>was the central focus of celebrity shark</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank or whatever.</v>

103
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:20.081
<v Speaker 1>It was a shock celebrity shark bait shop</v>
<v Speaker 1>that marked the end of my career.</v>

104
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 1>So I like to pick that scab liked it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

105
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

106
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So it was always when it was already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Korea was</v>

107
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.470
<v Speaker 2>really fading away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.313
<v Speaker 2>there's signs because you ride on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>surf and people give you attention and </v>

109
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:33.504
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 2>the fantastic infantilizes you this kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of career,</v>

111
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you can't get,</v>

112
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to wean off the mother </v>

113
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>breast of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

114
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the car,</v>

115
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started getting desperate and they </v>

116
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 2>take the nipple away and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

117
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:49.704
<v Speaker 2>I'll do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please document my gallbladder </v>

118
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 2>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

119
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:53.274
<v Speaker 2>here's something even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a shark tank with Richard and </v>

120
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.274
<v Speaker 2>grant and we'll film right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it marks the end of my career is </v>

121
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.450
<v Speaker 2>peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually receive enriched.</v>

122
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 2>He grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say very,</v>

123
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 2>very talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bright,</v>

124
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.573
<v Speaker 2>brilliant people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the machinery of celebrity will </v>

125
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:14.351
<v Speaker 2>ultimately deposit you in a shark tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was it off of them?</v>

126
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>The obvious that was particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>revealing about that.</v>

127
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:18.824
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the nature of that revelation </v>

128
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.540
<v Speaker 2>of knowing that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over,</v>

129
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

130
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 2>But in the first few years of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>ejected from the central,</v>

131
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the central spotlight is you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well this is just temporary.</v>

132
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Surely they'll have me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's telltale signs,</v>

133
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>like when I was asked to cut the ribbon </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Costco's for the Qa,</v>

134
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.773
<v Speaker 2>Costa coffee at terminal three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another sign that things aren't </v>

135
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.274
<v Speaker 2>going well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Richard and I were joking saying how </v>

136
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 2>awful this show was and really would end</v>
<v Speaker 2>our careers.</v>

137
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.014
<v Speaker 2>And then it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did kind of end around then and they </v>

138
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 2>had a really beautiful babe from </v>
<v Speaker 2>holyoke's,</v>

139
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was asked to take her top off to </v>

140
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 2>practice getting into a shark tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd say to Richard and I,</v>

141
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you aren't needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most days we weren't needed.</v>

142
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 2>So Richard and I both bought houses in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cape Town,</v>

143
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>which I still have because we were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bored in.</v>

144
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>The rand was really bad.</v>

145
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.803
<v Speaker 2>So you could buy one for about 10 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Richard and I went with a camera </v>

146
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>following us because they always liked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pretend,</v>

147
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is reality.</v>

148
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 2>We both bought houses and on day 75,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the babe with the breasts had refused to</v>

149
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 2>get in with the sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had been everyday training or right</v>

150
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.993
<v Speaker 2>making or stand in a frozen freezer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>check that she could take the cold with </v>

151
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>no top on imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she'd say,</v>

152
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>do you think I'm being exploded to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go,</v>

153
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

154
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last day she refused to get into.</v>

155
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the old ones in here.</v>

156
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Richard and I are now crammed into these</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber things.</v>

157
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

158
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I've actually got cystitis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you could say that,</v>

159
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a good thing to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>shark tank with.</v>

160
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 2>So they drop us in and we're not in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank and not in a cage like they usually</v>

161
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 2>do for special occasion.</v>

162
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 2>They put us in a tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a see through tube,</v>

163
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 2>which means you're in the aquarium and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sharks watching and he's magnified.</v>

164
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>So he comes at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pissed myself.</v>

165
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:15.974
<v Speaker 2>So that urine came out of my collar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then Richard and I started laughing </v>

166
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>beyond and they dubbed in screams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it ends with,</v>

167
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.163
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Richard and I are sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bottom of a test tube and I </v>

168
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 2>always say I'm the sharks just swam by </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a list celebrity.</v>

169
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.353
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty bloody brilliant </v>

170
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it does sound good now,</v>

171
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>but they cut a lot out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just basically tits,</v>

172
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.344
<v Speaker 2>tits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tits,</v>

173
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.213
<v Speaker 2>Richmond and I screaming and some urine </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in and coming out of her neck </v>

174
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 2>because credible image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

175
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>so obviously though all she told the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story in a very humorous way,</v>

176
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 2>it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agonizing.</v>

177
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to you mentally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritually that made you want to stop?</v>

178
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot more life before and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadder than an old celebrity.</v>

180
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.803
<v Speaker 2>it used to be Panto was the pits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's one of those reality shows </v>

182
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 2>where you eat a cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought this ain't happening,</v>

183
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people saying,</v>

184
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.460
<v Speaker 2>weren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

185
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>was I who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 2>it was never me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

187
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 2>So I thought jumped now jumped before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the party.</v>

188
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 2>The party's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.763
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 2>before you're not invited anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

191
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I jumped right out and went to school to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a degree in psychotherapy,</v>

192
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 2>which was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People let you know,</v>

193
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>drop me and laughed and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>it's psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just needed something.</v>

195
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wasn't going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist,</v>

196
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but you got me a new group of friends.</v>

197
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I had to wean myself like coming off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs off,</v>

198
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting on the tube and nobody going,</v>

199
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know who you are now.</v>

200
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who I am?</v>

201
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck no,</v>

202
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 2>buy a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody else,</v>

203
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>

204
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 2>The arrogance had to be squeezed out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like sweat.</v>

205
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually I had my new </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

206
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied,</v>

207
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:58.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

208
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>and then I'd study winnicott and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd studied bowlby and I got really,</v>

209
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is great.</v>

210
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.663
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it feel like you were picking up </v>

211
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 2>something that you would describe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brain started getting a honed again,</v>

212
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started to come to life and then,</v>

213
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to,</v>

214
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 2>then I had a serious breakdown in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>third year.</v>

215
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>That's when everything crumbled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it like before you invent,</v>

216
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 2>reinvent yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be a death.</v>

217
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I always think of the Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 2>before he rises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was death,</v>

219
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything shuts down all your,</v>

220
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 2>everything that was your reality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken away.</v>

221
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>There's just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some of us,</v>

222
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.893
<v Speaker 2>and I always love this expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where you either turned into </v>

223
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 2>wine or vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which coincidentally young did say.</v>

224
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 2>So I started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in that institution a long time.</v>

226
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Will Your institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

227
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.900
<v Speaker 2>And it was so bad that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

228
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.833
<v Speaker 2>this is tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point the BBC threw me another </v>

229
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:04.401
<v Speaker 2>bone and I did a show for a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a BBC Internet,</v>

230
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like it is now.</v>

231
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:08.754
<v Speaker 2>Sex seems like a show called Ruby's room</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something that three people would </v>

232
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:13.230
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about mental illness.</v>

233
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

234
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 2>every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 2>three per a person would come to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house that was the idea with a different</v>

236
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 2>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd have schizophrenia or,</v>

237
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical dysmorphia or bipolar,</v>

238
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.363
<v Speaker 2>and then I take them in a way to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>tea and they'd sit with my cat and my </v>

239
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:29.214
<v Speaker 2>kids would come in and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I knew how to interview them </v>

240
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>because they're my people.</v>

241
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Then at the very end it would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the symptoms and here's what you </v>

242
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:36.924
<v Speaker 2>can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I thought was really responsible </v>

243
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 2>and the show was sometimes hilarious by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time I was,</v>

244
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.593
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a great show even if you </v>

245
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>caught me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

246
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:47.904
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get better because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a blessing that I got kicked out </v>

247
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

248
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.333
<v Speaker 2>and they'd come over every week and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how bad it was when I first got the </v>

249
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:56.284
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first guest was a depressive and I </v>

250
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 2>had 10 shows to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was in the institution.</v>

251
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Ed had to get me pick me up from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick me up from the institution.</v>

252
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.953
<v Speaker 2>I've I put lipstick on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in the institution applauded </v>

253
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.383
<v Speaker 2>and said that was so brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you know that's from the cream </v>

254
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:14.374
<v Speaker 2>of the crop.</v>

255
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.453
<v Speaker 2>I went home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting with a depressive and I'm </v>

256
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.303
<v Speaker 2>from an institution dripping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dripping in sweat and trying to pretend </v>

257
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 2>you were who you used to be and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed person is looking at me going,</v>

258
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.500
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are more fucked than I am.</v>

259
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course nobody can see when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill.</v>

260
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 2>So I did this shaking slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they think,</v>

261
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's being funny.</v>

262
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Finished the interview and then was </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken back to the institution.</v>

263
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.043
<v Speaker 2>So my first show clinically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What type of mental illness were you </v>

264
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:42.964
<v Speaker 2>suffering from an the Sam?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will always have its clinical </v>

265
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:47.300
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

266
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's vanilla depression.</v>

267
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.323
<v Speaker 2>It's not the up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a long time in there and I </v>

268
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 2>tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had regions.</v>

269
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 2>They said you have to leave because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not finishing.</v>

270
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:03.841
<v Speaker 2>So everything was taken and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually when I came out and that was a</v>

271
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:04.601
<v Speaker 2>bad time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I'd sit for weeks on end in a chair.</v>

273
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get this where you'd look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the shower and think,</v>

274
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some day.</v>

275
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:11.794
<v Speaker 2>I hope I can get into that again because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not feasible that you could ever </v>

276
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 2>take a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

277
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too confusing.</v>

278
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.763
<v Speaker 2>So the nurse would come and hold my hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she finally take me to the </v>

279
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:25.294
<v Speaker 2>shower after a month and then eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got me to the door and then </v>

280
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 2>eventually she took me to the park and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was saved.</v>

281
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.333
<v Speaker 2>So you were experiencing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the despair and that despair fools like </v>

282
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 2>her sort of an absence of any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>

283
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 2>live force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any energy.</v>

284
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>What have you learned about psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>or neurology?</v>

285
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.240
<v Speaker 2>These helpful to you in understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own personal experience with regard</v>

286
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 2>to it's an extremist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

287
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study the brain is such a relief to </v>

288
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:05.884
<v Speaker 2>understand the pathology of it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you think it's not my imagination </v>

289
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 2>because in everybody looks is feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're making it up.</v>

290
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike.</v>

291
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

292
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody thinks they're making it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

293
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.933
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the disease isn't necessarily </v>

294
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shame.</v>

295
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.973
<v Speaker 2>That's what we all suffer from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like saying to somebody with </v>

296
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

297
00:14:27.991 --> 00:14:31.520
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember where the try harder.</v>

298
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

299
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 3>where is it now I've taken it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swallowed it.</v>

300
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is cruel.</v>

301
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So let's say to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're neurologically.</v>

302
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Same thing as let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a brain.</v>

303
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I find it even</v>

304
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.933
<v Speaker 1>as a person that sort of personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows about mental illness and knows a </v>

305
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 1>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still sort of defined mental illness,</v>

306
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 1>annoying because the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your brain is an organ.</v>

307
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you flipped yourself upside down,</v>

308
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>would you call your feet mental illness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

309
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

310
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you look physically well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does it mean?</v>

311
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental is physical.</v>

312
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.100
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an Oregon.</v>

313
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the only one that when it breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

314
00:15:16.751 --> 00:15:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't get any sympathy cards and yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs everything.</v>

315
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 2>So the ignorance of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing.</v>

316
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Why do you imagine or what do you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is?</v>

317
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always been a stigma,</v>

318
00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:30.751
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:15:30.751 --> 00:15:33.240
<v Speaker 2>there's always been women at 55 lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>their jobs.</v>

320
00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one that goes,</v>

322
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always a taboo,</v>

323
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people may think they are by the</v>

324
00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:42.810
<v Speaker 2>grace of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

325
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:43.441
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:46.080
<v Speaker 2>it's only a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we were burned at the stake,</v>

327
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.210
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will leave,</v>

328
00:15:48.211 --> 00:15:49.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gay movement suddenly now </v>

329
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals are everywhere in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole gay thing will change again.</v>

330
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.630
<v Speaker 2>It'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be the last taboo.</v>

331
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.810
<v Speaker 2>But where we are now is still in an era </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shame</v>

332
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.313
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair.</v>

334
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to examine the template of a</v>

335
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>bigotry against a sort of an inverted </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>

336
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>minority social groups such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals,</v>

337
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:15.494
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costing of the dominant class is </v>

338
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 1>shadow into those groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of talking about James Baldwins</v>

339
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:27.941
<v Speaker 1>analysis of the category of Negro is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it bears the shadow of the white</v>

340
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.503
<v Speaker 1>dominant class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it is in terms of attempting to </v>

341
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.913
<v Speaker 1>follow the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea that it's a maligned and </v>

342
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 1>outcast group and it's not something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essential.</v>

343
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Because when I think about mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>

344
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:39.974
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps it's because if perception </v>

345
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:43.250
<v Speaker 1>itself is warped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

346
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that you can trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing tangible there.</v>

347
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>And when a human being looks the same as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always look,</v>

348
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're behaving differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it very,</v>

349
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:53.114
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it frightening when other people </v>

350
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:58.480
<v Speaker 1>are in the exhibit in mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

351
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but from a sort of from a just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not tangible.</v>

352
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.600
<v Speaker 1>my professor said,</v>

354
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bitching again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a bill gates put the money into </v>

355
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 2>mental health instead of malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would know what it is.</v>

356
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.313
<v Speaker 2>You would be able to define depression </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the way you can down to find </v>

357
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:15.374
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's only because it had a lot of </v>

358
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>money thrown at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because it's some mystical,</v>

359
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's serial disease.</v>

360
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just that nobody threw the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

361
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>

362
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So you think no matter how seemingly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorial something might be,</v>

363
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it is on some level mechanical on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's consciousness,</v>

364
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>so consciousness a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

365
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.620
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

366
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Speaker 1>O w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue.</v>

367
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bash us 15 minutes every 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

368
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Careful what I said about consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mechanics consciousness.</v>

369
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole nother ballpark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but disease,</v>

370
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:53.214
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we can look and see how cancer </v>

371
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>is formed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure it wasn't possible,</v>

372
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand years ago.</v>

373
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Now it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is.</v>

374
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a disease that's mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness is a whole different ball.</v>

375
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.593
<v Speaker 3>Park consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the relationship between consciousness </v>

376
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:13.431
<v Speaker 3>and presumably the brain is integral a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to understand the brain can</v>

377
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 3>understand disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

378
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a technical glitch,</v>

379
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.173
<v Speaker 3>but it can that the consciousnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is that we just don't </v>

380
00:18:23.921 --> 00:18:24.754
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

381
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.643
<v Speaker 3>but is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but given the perspective and </v>

382
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:33.291
<v Speaker 3>consciousness are possibly synonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the understanding of mental illness</v>

383
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.460
<v Speaker 3>and consciousness are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think integrated,</v>

384
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.443
<v Speaker 3>but that there is a relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental illness and the nature of a </v>

385
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 3>person's consciousness because it's your</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that is becoming warped,</v>

386
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:47.544
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least that's what's manifestly </v>

387
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what consciousness is.</v>

388
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.093
<v Speaker 3>Louis Wolpert says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sadnesses to depression where the </v>

389
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:58.640
<v Speaker 3>tumor is to cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that's.</v>

390
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 3>God said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is something.</v>

391
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.470
<v Speaker 3>There's something physiologically not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

392
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

393
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness is a much bigger ballpark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

394
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean is that if you have</v>

395
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 3>a malignancy in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your brain,</v>

396
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 3>abby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna Affect your thinking.</v>

397
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people,</v>

398
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:19.704
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the man who thought his wife was </v>

399
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:22.171
<v Speaker 3>a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

400
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>all those extreme things that I think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>even put in my book,</v>

401
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 3>people who assumed that their arms are </v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

402
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:28.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

403
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 3>are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are their enemy.</v>

404
00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 3>And so what's that illness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it written down.</v>

405
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 3>They chopped their limbs off other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

406
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:34.974
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see their mother and they see it that </v>

407
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.524
<v Speaker 3>she's a stranger or they see their left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand and it looks like it's trying to </v>

408
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:41.070
<v Speaker 3>kill them.</v>

409
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.903
<v Speaker 3>Those are brain diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can easily be marked as to what's </v>

410
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:48.520
<v Speaker 3>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's their consciousness is a,</v>

411
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.810
<v Speaker 3>of course it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

412
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.810
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

413
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.643
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it inflicts itself on how the person </v>

414
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:54.564
<v Speaker 3>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

415
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 3>but they're still conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still,</v>

416
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 3>the moment they wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

417
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we express ourselves as a teeny,</v>

418
00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 3>teeny grain of sand on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

419
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 3>an iceberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the size of Mars.</v>

420
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So how you think and how you talk has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with,</v>

421
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a teeny bit of consciousness </v>

422
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.150
<v Speaker 3>because consciousness is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

423
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.040
<v Speaker 3>it's your heart rushing through its </v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins being made.</v>

424
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't even know,</v>

425
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

426
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.390
<v Speaker 3>get somebody who's in physics in here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

427
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm at his feet with the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between wellness,</v>

428
00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:27.714
<v Speaker 3>mental wellness and mindfulness that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been exploring really in all </v>

429
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.124
<v Speaker 3>three of these books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that it's using tools </v>

430
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 3>that have been available for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time,</v>

431
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Millenia primarily through a theological</v>
<v Speaker 3>means and</v>

432
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.301
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

433
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:54.301
<v Speaker 1>these are predicated mostly on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cleansing the consciousness,</v>

434
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 1>having a relationship with an aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that's not mechanical,</v>

435
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>that is not the body is not the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

436
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.043
<v Speaker 1>given that your latest book is a monk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a neuroscientist and you exploring </v>

437
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring wellbeing,</v>

438
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 1>exploring being a human being.</v>

439
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

440
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.110
<v Speaker 2>The monk is obviously from the mindful </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

441
00:21:15.111 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 2>did neuro scientist is very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

442
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

443
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.100
<v Speaker 2>what addiction is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the future works with how evolution,</v>

444
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affected us,</v>

445
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.073
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

446
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 2>how we actually do evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

447
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.100
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how relationships are formed.</v>

448
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.993
<v Speaker 2>He comes from the very mechanical side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other one is the mind and most </v>

449
00:21:33.301 --> 00:21:36.300
<v Speaker 2>of them are married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They completely agree on every front.</v>

450
00:21:36.301 --> 00:21:38.430
<v Speaker 2>So that's to me really reassuring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

451
00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:40.620
<v Speaker 2>they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a good sense of humor.</v>

452
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to take mindfulness,</v>

453
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.933
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness was made simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple simply for the west by Jon Kabat </v>

454
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Zinn who was dealing with people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

455
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.180
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't for any mystical experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then my professor,</v>

456
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:55.014
<v Speaker 2>Mark Williams started to use mindfulness</v>
<v Speaker 2>for psychological reasons for people </v>

457
00:21:58.381 --> 00:21:59.214
<v Speaker 2>with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're using some ancient wisdom as </v>

458
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:06.921
<v Speaker 2>young did to everybody borrows and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it all in using MRI scanning,</v>

459
00:22:07.711 --> 00:22:08.670
<v Speaker 2>which is only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

460
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.563
<v Speaker 2>it's not that old and they obviously did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of research and it was </v>

461
00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:13.920
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness.</v>

462
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It had the best results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like somebody showed up with a</v>

463
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:17.544
<v Speaker 2>Bindi and decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push this one because you </v>

464
00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:20.514
<v Speaker 2>know there's a market in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally did experiments on the </v>

465
00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:26.550
<v Speaker 2>works and cognitive and mindfulness had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best results,</v>

466
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.790
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

467
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.440
<v Speaker 2>know what's good for me is going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

468
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say jogging is good.</v>

469
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy got,</v>

470
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.730
<v Speaker 2>the guy dropped dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who'd invented it?</v>

471
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.193
<v Speaker 2>So we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of mindfulness is understanding </v>

472
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:41.150
<v Speaker 2>where's your tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you know,</v>

473
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.830
<v Speaker 2>how much is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when does it tip into sickness?</v>

474
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.320
<v Speaker 2>When is it a habit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does it go into addiction?</v>

475
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.580
<v Speaker 2>When am I working in my flow and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>have I tip and now I'm going to burn out</v>

476
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:53.340
<v Speaker 2>my immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what mindfulness is good for,</v>

477
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.500
<v Speaker 2>is that you can check your internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

478
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't get into the Buddhist stuff.</v>

479
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what mindfulness in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of it and how you practice</v>

480
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:04.300
<v Speaker 1>it means just for people listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

481
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do the woo woo stuff.</v>

482
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

483
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.070
<v Speaker 2>that that was not my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was appealing.</v>

484
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.433
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could give you the scientific reason </v>

485
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:17.540
<v Speaker 2>which really turns me on how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do it is.</v>

486
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.240
<v Speaker 2>But I like what happens in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do do it,</v>

487
00:23:20.241 --> 00:23:21.920
<v Speaker 2>because if I explained to sit up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

488
00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:22.754
<v Speaker 2>will you lie down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get up and then you lie </v>

489
00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 2>down and you get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to show you my six pack for you</v>

490
00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:28.281
<v Speaker 2>to actually go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

491
00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I say,</v>

492
00:23:30.051 --> 00:23:31.700
<v Speaker 2>this is what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit down.</v>

493
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to explain what the effects are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brain.</v>

494
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:40.130
<v Speaker 2>So when you sit and you have a focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take your mind to focus,</v>

495
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.010
<v Speaker 2>let me just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I do my spiel?</v>

496
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Usually we're in a high state anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the culture we've created.</v>

497
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago it wasn't so bad.</v>

498
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.563
<v Speaker 2>Now distraction is our middle name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means there's a part of our </v>

499
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:54.734
<v Speaker 2>brain that's primitive called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amygdala and its aroused when we feel </v>

500
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:00.170
<v Speaker 2>threatened and that's what the court is </v>
<v Speaker 2>all out.</v>

501
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used it with dinosaurs or whoever the</v>

502
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:05.780
<v Speaker 2>enemy was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the incident was over,</v>

503
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 2>we got calm again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

504
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.283
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it never shuts down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why were so many people are </v>

505
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 2>burning out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids are cutting.</v>

506
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the situation is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>flowing cortisol the whole time.</v>

507
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it leads to every problem.</v>

508
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 2>We have physical ones too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stop thinking mental.</v>

509
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Too Much Cortisol Burns causes cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes to infertility,</v>

510
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:27.974
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the problems are because of the </v>

511
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 2>cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you start to focus on one of your</v>

512
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 2>senses because of the cortisol or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could send me,</v>

513
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 2>those are the conditions that create </v>
<v Speaker 2>causal,</v>

514
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 2>like the cortisone is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening everyone one level,</v>

515
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.173
<v Speaker 2>but like also what really needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the conditions of created </v>

516
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 2>conditions that creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because we aren't really thinking,</v>

517
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not any more,</v>

518
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 2>we're more at the mercy of technology.</v>

519
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's,</v>

520
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.860
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

521
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 2>let's shut technology down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we put it there.</v>

522
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.430
<v Speaker 2>That is our evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

523
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 2>we used to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve to adapt to climate.</v>

524
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Now we adapt to culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is our culture,</v>

525
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.290
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the genetic variants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it.</v>

526
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:10.670
<v Speaker 2>So now they're having to bring in things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mindfulness and they'll be in a few</v>

527
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.370
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be mental fitbit's a bet you to</v>

528
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:14.204
<v Speaker 2>be able to test your own cortisol </v>
<v Speaker 2>because left to our own devices in this </v>

529
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addictions out the window,</v>

530
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at its height,</v>

531
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

532
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what the situation is,</v>

533
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.460
<v Speaker 2>but the result is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

534
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing with mindfulness,</v>

535
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.170
<v Speaker 2>when you focus on a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go with me on this.</v>

536
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.150
<v Speaker 2>The immediately there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking anymore,</v>

537
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:35.984
<v Speaker 2>you're focused on a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Amygdala goes deactivates and </v>

538
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 2>this other part called the insula.</v>

539
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm making it simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Activates,</v>

540
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.723
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each time you do an exercise where you </v>

541
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 2>watch your mind gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you focus on a sense it deactivates</v>

542
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:51.170
<v Speaker 2>the other one activates and the more you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

543
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:52.004
<v Speaker 2>just like a sit up that insulin gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffed like a muscle so that when the </v>

544
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 2>shit hits the fan and you get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stressed,</v>

545
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to pull to a focus because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>

546
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done the workout.</v>

547
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.350
<v Speaker 2>And then that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

548
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.440
<v Speaker 2>those voices going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is shit,</v>

549
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I depressed?</v>

550
00:26:08.271 --> 00:26:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else's depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quieter.</v>

551
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.203
<v Speaker 2>What sense do you use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually follow my breathing and the </v>

552
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:16.154
<v Speaker 2>thing is it's portable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have to sit on a gluten free </v>

553
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.270
<v Speaker 2>cushion if I'm on the taxi here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

554
00:26:21.271 --> 00:26:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than see,</v>

555
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 2>they've actually said that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do scans on people mind wandering.</v>

556
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that mind wandering makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>us really miserable and also you're,</v>

557
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're missing three,</v>

558
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>four year life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

559
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.703
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ordinarily a out of five thoughts </v>

560
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 2>for a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just human.</v>

561
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Our proclivity as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

562
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>it was for good reason because if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think negatively,</v>

563
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 2>we would have been eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we always have to be on our toes.</v>

564
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.943
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing with mindfulness is virtually </v>

565
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.853
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get this,</v>

566
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a lion and not a Bush better not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sing a Disney too,</v>

567
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 2>because chances are you wouldn't be here</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the evolution stakes these days.</v>

568
00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does.</v>

569
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I can see how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

570
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm jumping around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is,</v>

571
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:07.464
<v Speaker 2>is that I met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can lose my temper like anybody and </v>

572
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:12.150
<v Speaker 2>rage is still my drug of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

573
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I can get the cortisol down quicker so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't give me the heart attack.</v>

574
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.883
<v Speaker 2>How does it work in practice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then thought I'll get up in the morning </v>

575
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 2>and to me it's a new habit like brushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>my teeth.</v>

576
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do it at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all I do is track my breathing.</v>

577
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean there's no thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get this wrong.</v>

578
00:27:31.051 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 2>The only time there's no thoughts is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dead.</v>

579
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't write this show.</v>

584
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a ballerina?</v>

591
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.930
<v Speaker 2>What did my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

592
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:00.510
<v Speaker 2>this could go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going,</v>

593
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>but because I'm used to watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm used to watching.</v>

594
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 2>They're more like a radio in another </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

595
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I sort of expect them and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

596
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that's tracked number 42 there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strack number 77.</v>

597
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course you admire Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you're an idiot.</v>

598
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it go through.</v>

599
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are still a little bit of an </v>

600
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 2>idiot and he's looking at you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

601
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that.</v>

602
00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 2>So I sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute you can watch your thoughts,</v>

603
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you're not a slave to them and some will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be true.</v>

604
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.583
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is I didn't waste my </v>

605
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 2>energy thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an asshole,</v>

606
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Speaker 2>then I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

607
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Whereas before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the cognitive thinking</v>

608
00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:39.780
<v Speaker 2>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get caught in a habit.</v>

609
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.613
<v Speaker 2>I really thought I was the stooge that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought I was an idiot and I </v>

610
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 2>can blame it on my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can blame it on whatever you want to</v>

611
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:49.560
<v Speaker 2>go on and on about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is short,</v>

612
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.530
<v Speaker 2>so instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get my normal records,</v>

613
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.660
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a,</v>

614
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 2>if the minute you go to a sense thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowers your listen,</v>

615
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you could,</v>

616
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could focus on some things.</v>

617
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 2>You could use any sensory information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could use me re-designated attention</v>

618
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Arab's used those beads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

619
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you focus on the sense of the beats,</v>

620
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:13.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a very smart thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

621
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.603
<v Speaker 2>that means that there's part of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body that's not involved in the </v>

622
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

623
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so of course the thinking comes through,</v>

624
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:21.624
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

625
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 2>you're laying back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going,</v>

626
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what I'm thinking.</v>

627
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's rethink.</v>

628
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Russell actually likes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just break the habit.</v>

629
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.733
<v Speaker 2>He adores me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what interests me is how many of </v>

630
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>these men in this particular technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness east,</v>

631
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>found in</v>

632
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 1>theology now like I'm sort of aware like</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>

633
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:46.264
<v Speaker 1>that there is much in a religion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripture that is sort of of its time </v>

634
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and is used to underwrite bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and establishment.</v>

635
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:55.240
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

636
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.073
<v Speaker 1>when I become fascinated is when in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theology there are techniques that are </v>

637
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.383
<v Speaker 1>effective in helping us to moderate </v>
<v Speaker 1>control our consciousness and improve </v>

638
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:05.944
<v Speaker 1>our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they cannot possibly have had </v>

639
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 1>access to the which in their case can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been underwritten by the technology</v>

640
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 1>that is currently being examined with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

641
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>how do they know in the vader's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to work?</v>

642
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 1>How do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

643
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

644
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 2>I know they knew that they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were uh,</v>

645
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody went bingo.</v>

646
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.270
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is they've also put nuns </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a scanner and the very fact that they</v>

647
00:30:33.271 --> 00:30:36.230
<v Speaker 2>pray also lowers the Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

648
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

649
00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:40.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are techniques that are you </v>

650
00:30:45.031 --> 00:30:46.890
<v Speaker 2>feeling okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get some key tips?</v>

651
00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Can Get qtip told me it'll be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be moisturizer.</v>

652
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Don't you worry there'll be something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>replace.</v>

653
00:30:54.781 --> 00:30:55.614
<v Speaker 2>The key tips</v>

654
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>are constant morphing need in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

655
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I have this to this thing you say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of your time.</v>

656
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:02.964
<v Speaker 1>This is that my inability to be present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in pleasant situations </v>

657
00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 1>really troubles me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

658
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I am a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need intensity in my life.</v>

659
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:14.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a recent,</v>

660
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.950
<v Speaker 1>had an experience where I hung out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>two men I didn't know well,</v>

661
00:31:16.951 --> 00:31:19.470
<v Speaker 1>separate occasions on the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first part of the day.</v>

662
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Very sort of a lighthearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely occasion.</v>

663
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.093
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you not fully present for this </v>

664
00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:25.404
<v Speaker 1>while you were observing this later on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the thousand situation was quite </v>

665
00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was there,</v>

666
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt sort of somewhat threatened,</v>

667
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.450
<v Speaker 1>not entirely safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was very,</v>

668
00:31:33.451 --> 00:31:34.284
<v Speaker 1>very present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something in my makeup means that I pay </v>

669
00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>more attention when I'm.</v>

670
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

671
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

672
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 2>that's only because the neuroscientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so hip on this stuff.</v>

673
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.953
<v Speaker 2>I would ask questions of the monk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the neuroscientists and this is </v>

674
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:49.714
<v Speaker 2>something he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes me feel better that you're not </v>

675
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:54.690
<v Speaker 2>the only one if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

676
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 2>whenever we're focused on anger or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

677
00:31:57.671 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 2>the negatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of in a way us at our best,</v>

678
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were built for danger.</v>

679
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 2>So with this kind of when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to think about,</v>

680
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.480
<v Speaker 2>we really like it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said in your book,</v>

681
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 2>we're all addicts to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 2>it's now it's a lot of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to have q tips.</v>

684
00:32:16.781 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the chase.</v>

685
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.433
<v Speaker 2>The chase is much easier when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something fearful or Europe against the </v>

686
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:24.380
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a,</v>

687
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 2>an the animal lurks within us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

688
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.393
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a chemical stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's internally moving that we </v>

689
00:32:30.681 --> 00:32:31.514
<v Speaker 1>subsequently narrativize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why once the q tips are </v>

690
00:32:34.281 --> 00:32:36.770
<v Speaker 1>achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moisturizer will be required because</v>

691
00:32:36.771 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the chemical in both continuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so interesting</v>

692
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.903
<v Speaker 2>is that we feel the emotion first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll feel to drive and they put </v>

693
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Speaker 2>scanners on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel it.</v>

694
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And then two seconds later I'll think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

695
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.900
<v Speaker 2>So your thoughts are the last to know in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way.</v>

696
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:50.734
<v Speaker 2>So if you're driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're in the addiction of </v>

697
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

698
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 2>It'll kick in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll look for people,</v>

699
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>you'll make excuses like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

700
00:32:57.471 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll give up smoking tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

701
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to eat,</v>

702
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 2>but I think I will eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain will outsmart you every time,</v>

703
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's your insights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get the urge first.</v>

704
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.813
<v Speaker 2>I sort of said in the book it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hive of bees and the queen is sitting </v>

705
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She and she suddenly wants,</v>

706
00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 2>let's say a starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thinks because she wants it.</v>

707
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:17.164
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a zillion worker bees in </v>

708
00:33:19.181 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>slave bees in valet parking fees.</v>

709
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.213
<v Speaker 2>They're already buzzing with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whoever buzzes the loudest has made </v>

710
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>the decision to get the latte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the queen things.</v>

711
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I wanted.</v>

712
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.373
<v Speaker 2>There's been a vote in every cell in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body and before you actually kick </v>

713
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:34.934
<v Speaker 2>into something and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the juice of anger and rage is so </v>

714
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Speaker 2>much more addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever gets addicted to Kale.</v>

715
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.693
<v Speaker 2>I'm really trying to create that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you won't drinking stuff five a </v>

716
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 2>gallon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still don't like it.</v>

717
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once I thought,</v>

718
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:50.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

719
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>juice is good for you.</v>

720
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:55.910
<v Speaker 2>So I made a big thing of it and I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the train and drank it the next day I</v>

721
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:56.744
<v Speaker 2>spent my day vomiting and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I figured out I had drunk the </v>

722
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of four football because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also his stuff for football fields.</v>

723
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I had food in my body</v>

724
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.420
<v Speaker 1>drinking because of the stuff rubin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

725
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.470
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

726
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.340
<v Speaker 1>so the understanding consciousness from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mechanical perspective,</v>

727
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.423
<v Speaker 1>the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind or people in academia so </v>

728
00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:25.621
<v Speaker 1>particular about the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my point is these are,</v>

729
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have a mechanical understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>as expressed through that analogy around</v>

730
00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the hive mind and aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

731
00:34:32.861 --> 00:34:33.694
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the essential self being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen bee and different aspects of the </v>

732
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:37.690
<v Speaker 1>mind being different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 1>different bees within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what</v>

734
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 2>these are the consciousness and we only </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about the queen.</v>

735
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 2>So when you say consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea</v>

736
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.210
<v Speaker 1>except of course many of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

737
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.093
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the techniques that I am interested in </v>

738
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>which incidentally are sourced from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same place as mindfulness.</v>

739
00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Just another aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that we can attune ourselves to</v>

740
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:05.531
<v Speaker 1>an aspect of consciousness that is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is truly witnessing all else.</v>

741
00:35:06.531 --> 00:35:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

742
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.480
<v Speaker 1>how could it be because you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering so you know,</v>

743
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.443
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what my experience of my experience </v>

744
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 1>of meditation is that it's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospectively that go,</v>

745
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.291
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

746
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:19.124
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will just then that's already </v>

747
00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:22.304
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't thinking and cataloging what </v>

748
00:35:24.951 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>went on for one minute or a second or </v>
<v Speaker 1>for five minutes,</v>

749
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:28.394
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my understanding of time it has </v>

750
00:35:30.451 --> 00:35:32.580
<v Speaker 1>been removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsequently I narrativize it and go,</v>

751
00:35:32.581 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what was happening.</v>

752
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm having a different relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with in those moments.</v>

753
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

754
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have sex or I'm not good </v>

755
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:43.780
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or this might,</v>

756
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of this or a desire that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a cessation in that.</v>

757
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.773
<v Speaker 3>So that's it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another aspect of meditation </v>

758
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:51.834
<v Speaker 3>that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think can change our </v>

759
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:54.520
<v Speaker 3>relationship in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

760
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.763
<v Speaker 3>a more total way or a more extreme way </v>
<v Speaker 3>than just using it as a technique to </v>

761
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 3>calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is bloody valuable.</v>

762
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.410
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're completely right.</v>

763
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I get very excited about the mechanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

764
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 3>but that's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

765
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 3>the uncle say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

766
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:09.850
<v Speaker 3>get off it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

767
00:36:09.851 --> 00:36:10.684
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a practice of spirituality and I </v>

768
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 3>have an allergy to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

769
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

770
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:18.384
<v Speaker 3>I grew up at the time where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirthed and then somebody shoved a </v>

771
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:23.150
<v Speaker 3>crystal up my ass and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 3>religious persecution drove your family </v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

773
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.810
<v Speaker 3>That might be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

774
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:28.644
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I can't see it or I can't smell </v>

775
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

776
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 3>But of course the point of mindfulness </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a.</v>

777
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 3>and I have a hard time saying it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop.</v>

778
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.203
<v Speaker 3>I always call it the c word compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which now I talk about in the book and </v>

779
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 3>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are also the point of it.</v>

780
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.963
<v Speaker 3>But you see my proclivities always go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the daddy won't think I'm smarter than </v>

781
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:52.171
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the,</v>

782
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physiology of it.</v>

783
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Daddy will think it's another cookie </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

784
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 3>which Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just had a revelation.</v>

785
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 3>We must kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>must die killing us.</v>

786
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like 8,000</v>

787
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:05.574
<v Speaker 3>years of shrinkage you just did is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons probably I'm holding on to the </v>

788
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:11.850
<v Speaker 3>sciences because my dad said everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>I did was cool stuff.</v>

789
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 3>There's not just that though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ruby.</v>

790
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:14.694
<v Speaker 3>This is all our father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patriarchy itself is built on </v>

791
00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:18.414
<v Speaker 3>materialism and mechanistic thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely because it can be commodified </v>

792
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:23.034
<v Speaker 3>and sold and as soon as we begin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>access aspects of consciousness or self </v>

793
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 3>that are beyond mechanistic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialistic thinking,</v>

794
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 3>we begin to dive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dive voltage,</v>

795
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.363
<v Speaker 3>understand access realms where our role </v>
<v Speaker 3>here is no longer the role of the </v>

796
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 3>consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the civilian,</v>

797
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 3>the citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something quite different.</v>

798
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that fascinates me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your work,</v>

799
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.563
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what I think you're doing </v>

800
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:50.514
<v Speaker 3>beautifully and what cannot be disputed </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're making it accessible to a p </v>

801
00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.220
<v Speaker 3>and people need like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

802
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:57.054
<v Speaker 3>People need to understand it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>material and mechanics and patriarchy </v>

803
00:38:00.391 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 3>and if that gets people to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

804
00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>that's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

805
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.703
<v Speaker 3>but what I am fascinated by is how will </v>
<v Speaker 3>people accessing this information </v>

806
00:38:10.051 --> 00:38:11.040
<v Speaker 3>without any of these tools.</v>

807
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.903
<v Speaker 3>And what else is there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think you're monk friend is </v>

808
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:14.634
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is about compassionate is about </v>

809
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:16.404
<v Speaker 3>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have been talking about it for </v>

810
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:17.994
<v Speaker 3>Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knowing that our salvation is in that </v>

811
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:20.484
<v Speaker 3>direction and the father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's solely and uniquely </v>

812
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:23.574
<v Speaker 3>external,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the father like you have just </v>

813
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:26.310
<v Speaker 3>expressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we carry with us.</v>

814
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.293
<v Speaker 3>It becomes all of our father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both inner and outer and it prevents us </v>

815
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 3>from exploring neurological circuitry </v>
<v Speaker 3>which might give us,</v>

816
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

817
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 3>say new world to your time back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should write a book.</v>

818
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

819
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I've got a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made the first tentative steps into</v>

820
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 3>the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a brilliant thing.</v>

821
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.750
<v Speaker 3>And I just had an epiphany about my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go on that.</v>

822
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>You're still trying to press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

823
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:51.860
<v Speaker 3>I can only do one pip otherwise now come</v>
<v Speaker 3>on very.</v>

824
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.930
<v Speaker 3>There are series of exactly what goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

825
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Michael Epiphany's is they can do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment dialogue.</v>

826
00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.713
<v Speaker 3>He gave me multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple epiphany's barely even moved </v>

827
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 3>off the chair and the epiphany's carrier</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the train.</v>

828
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:06.903
<v Speaker 3>She could never walk again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making sport at this rate while </v>

829
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.910
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman is permanently.</v>

830
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.971
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

831
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think that there is an obvious.</v>

832
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.663
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there is an aspect of your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology even in your sort of </v>

833
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 3>enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern.</v>

834
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 3>You're right that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

835
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father and all of us motivated me to</v>

836
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 3>seek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it means it's a very thin slice.</v>

837
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mechanics are the thin slice.</v>

838
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 3>The bigger consciousness is the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>mccoy.</v>

839
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I obviously it wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Buddhism.</v>

840
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the real mccoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find it difficult to talk about,</v>

841
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:46.591
<v Speaker 3>even though I studied it at Oxford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys opened consciousness.</v>

842
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.330
<v Speaker 3>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't define it because it doesn't</v>

843
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:50.164
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

844
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I think Einstein said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're not conscious,</v>

845
00:39:53.261 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 3>how do we define consciousness?</v>

846
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't define it,</v>

847
00:39:56.861 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 3>but they experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys open up where it's timeless,</v>

848
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the 10,000</v>

849
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:03.610
<v Speaker 3>hour guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's timeless.</v>

850
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 3>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

851
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do tests on these monks the whole </v>

852
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:08.531
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

853
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 3>doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

854
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:13.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a blink test where most of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>Amygdala with sound,</v>

855
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they show really disturbing </v>

856
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys,</v>

857
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.240
<v Speaker 3>their Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more complicated than that.</v>

858
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:23.030
<v Speaker 3>But they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their Cortisol doesn't rush language,</v>

859
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it worked.</v>

860
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 3>It happened to be that it could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been people who were astrologists.</v>

861
00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:32.950
<v Speaker 3>It could've been a scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happened to be Buddhism.</v>

862
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that it happened to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would say no.</v>

863
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.633
<v Speaker 3>We have this technology passed down from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Buddha who had to stop saying it as </v>

864
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:40.840
<v Speaker 3>a Westerner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

865
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 3>They knew who the WHO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 3>with our arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think,</v>

867
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I was sitting there,</v>

868
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:46.984
<v Speaker 3>what was he doing it meanwhile they knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and so what fascinates me is </v>

869
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.890
<v Speaker 3>what else I know and what else they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would teach us if we follow this down.</v>

870
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.873
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think I live with a monk </v>

871
00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.270
<v Speaker 3>through your different modes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

872
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 3>he lives in my house but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his job is,</v>

873
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:04.000
<v Speaker 3>he works for Google and he works for </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook and he works for banks and they</v>

874
00:41:04.001 --> 00:41:06.920
<v Speaker 3>all long to learn this piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

875
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 3>And how do is this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

876
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>this monk 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

877
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy at the monk in the book.</v>

878
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:17.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm using your gas now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know we let the monkey.</v>

879
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I shifted monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is that bad?</v>

880
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:21.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

881
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it is popped a monk in the spare</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

882
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.210
<v Speaker 3>The kids left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

883
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.230
<v Speaker 3>And that there was this room and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that is so such a great move.</v>

884
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 3>But I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing a conference and he.</v>

885
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.224
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can he,</v>

886
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 3>he's articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went to Oxford because he western?</v>

887
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mother.</v>

888
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.543
<v Speaker 3>I know this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember the Kumaras not mirror the </v>

889
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 3>other lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's his son.</v>

890
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.211
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

891
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 3>He's the son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

892
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.770
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his story is unbelievable.</v>

893
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>

894
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:51.314
<v Speaker 3>he was an addict and he went to clean up</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago at Sammy link and they </v>

895
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:56.810
<v Speaker 3>give a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

896
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 3>they give a course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

897
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:00.400
<v Speaker 3>for a year to clean up your act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

898
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.653
<v Speaker 3>he got so into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became the fully ordained monk and </v>

899
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking five years of silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

900
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 3>they don't just pass this card out and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to say his vibe in my house.</v>

901
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I called it my air freshener in or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toilet duct,</v>

902
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get a better vibe.</v>

903
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Do you meditate with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes we do.</v>

904
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

905
00:42:20.331 --> 00:42:21.164
<v Speaker 3>he travels the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in Jamaica and now with Google I </v>

906
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:25.980
<v Speaker 3>think because in tech stuff or doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>

907
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.280
<v Speaker 3>they all long to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

908
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 3>to learn meditation for different </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

909
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.760
<v Speaker 3>They pay him and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monk isn't allowed to have money,</v>

910
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 3>so he's building retreats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's just built one in.</v>

911
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:39.734
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Southampton and then he's </v>

912
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 3>building another one in Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not allowed to make money.</v>

913
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 3>So he's making the extreme ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

914
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.833
<v Speaker 3>He's coming around the coastline </v>
<v Speaker 3>building retreats and he's not allowed </v>

915
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 3>to have money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's curious,</v>

916
00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:53.710
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The retreats for white people to kind of</v>

917
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 3>go and get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a massage.</v>

918
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:55.821
<v Speaker 3>This is for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

919
00:42:55.821 --> 00:43:00.821
<v Speaker 3>Buddhist nuns and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also trade critiques are matching the</v>

920
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.093
<v Speaker 3>retreats and retreats have that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to a hotel and there's a candle </v>

921
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 3>in a stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they go,</v>

922
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.033
<v Speaker 3>oh yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now this appropriation of spiritual </v>

923
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:13.964
<v Speaker 3>doctrine and the commodification of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is something that I am kind of aware of </v>

924
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.393
<v Speaker 3>and it's peculiar when sort of great </v>
<v Speaker 3>tech monoliths such as Google and </v>

925
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 3>facebook recognize its efficacy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially say,</v>

926
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.420
<v Speaker 3>how can we commodify this?</v>

927
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:34.220
<v Speaker 3>How can we utilize this for profit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can we turn the light?</v>

928
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.083
<v Speaker 3>Because you said that you know that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience has been that it's increased </v>

929
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 3>your compassion and it's increased your </v>
<v Speaker 3>presence.</v>

930
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Now you may find yourself in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I presume you still have the drive</v>

931
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:50.180
<v Speaker 3>that your wife had because it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my DNA.</v>

932
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.253
<v Speaker 3>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing with it and let me </v>

933
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 3>know you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how is it working for you with this?</v>

934
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 3>How is your ego?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is your sort of self laceration,</v>

935
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:02.270
<v Speaker 3>self flagellation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's that all going now?</v>

936
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got the same tone.</v>

937
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't change skin.</v>

938
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.551
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

939
00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I can feel the same qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I said,</v>

940
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of anything better.</v>

941
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:15.440
<v Speaker 3>And Jon Kabat Zinn said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more like a radio in another room.</v>

942
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.220
<v Speaker 3>Like I can grab it and be Ruby again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of me so addictive,</v>

943
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you show me,</v>

944
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:21.283
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jon Kabat Zinn gave me a really good </v>

945
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:25.360
<v Speaker 3>review it last night for the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sides,</v>

946
00:44:25.361 --> 00:44:27.200
<v Speaker 3>you and he's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my.</v>

947
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.093
<v Speaker 3>He invented mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my next thing was to write John and </v>

948
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think I could come over</v>

949
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 2>and do my show for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 2>he's just the ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it.</v>

951
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:37.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

952
00:44:37.791 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an animal.</v>

953
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

954
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see the alien and I go,</v>

955
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>hey buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how you feel,</v>

956
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's not wild ambition that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made my career with no talent.</v>

957
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.393
<v Speaker 2>I would not have developed talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it in the beginning I wouldn't take </v>

958
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>no for an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just showed a bunch of me.</v>

959
00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't ever TV show.</v>

960
00:44:58.471 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm showing up.</v>

961
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn on the cameras.</v>

962
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:02.881
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

963
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 2>who the hell are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

964
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've arrived.</v>

965
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.053
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so do you think this is something that </v>

966
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:07.794
<v Speaker 2>can be for really interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said something interesting and I </v>

967
00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:11.304
<v Speaker 2>went off.</v>

968
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think whereas it could be </v>

969
00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:15.354
<v Speaker 1>described and diagnosed neurologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think there's another </v>

970
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 1>component to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This drive,</v>

971
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 1>this willingness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ongoing desire?</v>

972
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dopamine.</v>

973
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that gets people </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed and fixed on approval,</v>

974
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.950
<v Speaker 2>fixed on rage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed on,</v>

975
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now from doing.</v>

976
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

977
00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.653
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dad got out of their country two </v>

978
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 2>seconds before he would've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>annihilated,</v>

979
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 2>but he never shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he got to Chicago,</v>

980
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 2>he ate his way through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lived in rage.</v>

981
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 2>He became the tyrant he escaped from and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I lived.</v>

982
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I will eat you alive if you get in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and now it's just,</v>

983
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 2>it almost destroyed my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

984
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't around when my kids </v>

985
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.040
<v Speaker 2>were young and now because of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of watching the mind what?</v>

986
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Just watching it and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay Ruby,</v>

987
00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but without whipping myself because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if you hit the animal,</v>

988
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 2>it gets more violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

989
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 2>calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down,</v>

990
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 2>let's use that anger when we need it.</v>

991
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:14.070
<v Speaker 2>This isn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my ideal.</v>

992
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you know when,</v>

993
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 2>when the man hasn't come to fix your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fridge and it's been a year,</v>

994
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 2>use that anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Ruby,</v>

995
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.243
<v Speaker 2>go on the phone and do what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you put the phone down </v>

996
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.753
<v Speaker 2>then don't go call somebody up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I did because that son of </v>

997
00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:32.040
<v Speaker 2>a bitch didn't show up and I do some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this off on it.</v>

998
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.183
<v Speaker 2>Get off and then I've got it on and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started picking other things to make </v>

999
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:38.220
<v Speaker 2>me angry because I want more just like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>junkie.</v>

1000
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.743
<v Speaker 2>So kind of understanding that I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>give somebody hell and it's so tempting </v>

1001
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 2>because it does taste more delicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>than being nice.</v>

1002
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Wba said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every artist</v>

1003
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you must create his own religion and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are creating your own religion.</v>

1004
00:46:53.841 --> 00:46:54.674
<v Speaker 1>Sourced as it necessarily seems to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your case from a secular understanding </v>

1005
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.100
<v Speaker 1>of modern scientific ideas and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>

1006
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:04.943
<v Speaker 1>You're telling us some of your code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your methods for coping with </v>

1007
00:47:08.811 --> 00:47:09.644
<v Speaker 1>your personal human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you're saying that some of that </v>

1008
00:47:12.471 --> 00:47:13.304
<v Speaker 1>source material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drive is being repurposed </v>

1009
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.230
<v Speaker 1>effectively and have your relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1010
00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:21.200
<v Speaker 1>if your husband and your three children </v>
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>

1011
00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.730
<v Speaker 1>those relationships are improving</v>

1012
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.970
<v Speaker 2>but they are improving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then my kids are.</v>

1013
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 2>My two daughters are in comedy now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the engine starting to were,</v>

1014
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me and I'm becoming Ethel mermen to </v>

1015
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:36.280
<v Speaker 2>push them and they go back off and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel too,</v>

1016
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 2>but eventually I do have to back off </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's your kids.</v>

1017
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I can't devour them the way my dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoured me this time.</v>

1018
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm backing off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ate me alive and you know,</v>

1019
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 2>he died and we were not friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you live?</v>

1020
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1021
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 2>he overwhelmed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1022
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to mold me like a piece of clay.</v>

1023
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 2>They wanted a rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted a photocopy and I wasn't it.</v>

1024
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:01.030
<v Speaker 2>So they kicked the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He meant to be.</v>

1025
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I was meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know,</v>

1026
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my mother was perfect.</v>

1027
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 2>She spoke eight languages.</v>

1028
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 2>She married a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really bad move.</v>

1029
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.013
<v Speaker 2>A just a nice Jewish person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess not interesting for them to get </v>

1030
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>something outside of a d because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1031
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got really,</v>

1032
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:18.923
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get any grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were below the toilet because I </v>

1033
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:23.710
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know I was traumatized.</v>

1034
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't think they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what books did you read it?</v>

1035
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.180
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1036
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.353
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was putting the remedial class and </v>

1037
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 2>my brain was frozen and I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was dumb.</v>

1038
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 2>There were traumatized by your father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were wild.</v>

1039
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book way earlier called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you want me?</v>

1040
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you want me?</v>

1041
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And Carrie Fisher edited it and she said</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents were as crazy as hers.</v>

1042
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.740
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else to say because hers</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the a list.</v>

1043
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 2>And my parents were as dark as it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as dark as it comes</v>

1044
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.450
<v Speaker 1>by that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't to be diminishing,</v>

1045
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:56.284
<v Speaker 1>you mean sort of ordinary domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness as in there's not talking </v>

1046
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:00.480
<v Speaker 1>sexual abuse and violence.</v>

1047
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Really a lot to do with say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1048
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 2>but there's violence and there's fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's psychological torture.</v>

1049
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1050
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.970
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psych.</v>

1051
00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean add is a nice man who I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

1052
00:49:09.251 --> 00:49:10.084
<v Speaker 2>He said when he sees my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to take their head and Jeremy </v>

1053
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.343
<v Speaker 2>Chapman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side of a table because of the </v>

1054
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:17.134
<v Speaker 2>cruelty</v>

1055
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.423
<v Speaker 1>and the Philip Larkin talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they're responding to a sort of </v>

1056
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.730
<v Speaker 1>massive social trauma and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1057
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where they came from.</v>

1058
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:29.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell me about the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never mentioned.</v>

1059
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.900
<v Speaker 2>So they passed it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had noises of.</v>

1060
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.053
<v Speaker 2>I never watched a film about Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>because since I was a kid I heard </v>

1061
00:49:36.991 --> 00:49:37.824
<v Speaker 2>screaming in my head and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they gently sublimated it and past that </v>

1062
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:42.264
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>

1063
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 1>You think that the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not genetic.</v>

1064
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:47.274
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of some sort of manual </v>

1065
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.410
<v Speaker 1>psychological transference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I put my hands up,</v>

1066
00:49:52.411 --> 00:49:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Torture,</v>

1067
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:54.743
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mystery remains at the beginning of </v>

1068
00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.300
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis as separate from </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurology.</v>

1069
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:04.140
<v Speaker 1>There's these sort of distinct schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud who it's too pricey,</v>

1070
00:50:04.141 --> 00:50:04.974
<v Speaker 1>dreadfully believing the psyche is built</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon repression and primarily repressed </v>

1071
00:50:09.451 --> 00:50:12.640
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and young who maintained that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that,</v>

1072
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:13.483
<v Speaker 1>there was a mystery and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collective unconscious and a </v>

1073
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:23.810
<v Speaker 1>transcendent aspect to who we are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales on the button to.</v>

1077
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.850
<v Speaker 1>like in there like I love this Melville </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1078
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I hear a lot of all human sciences but </v>
<v Speaker 1>passing fables,</v>

1079
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 1>meaning that if you'll look at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1080
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 1>how cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quantum theory,</v>

1081
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1082
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.510
<v Speaker 1>so like w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>

1083
00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.353
<v Speaker 1>w what in the work of young you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating from your perspective of </v>

1084
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.700
<v Speaker 1>someone who understands numerology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1085
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:48.993
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let me say the answer to everything </v>

1086
00:50:50.561 --> 00:50:53.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just I hold onto it.</v>

1087
00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.110
<v Speaker 2>That's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1088
00:50:56.111 --> 00:50:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not cool.</v>

1089
00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not that reductionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's me showing off,</v>

1090
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

1091
00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I really liked meditation because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me much prettier.</v>

1092
00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.893
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I sit and I sit in front of my </v>

1093
00:51:09.401 --> 00:51:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Buddha and I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really liked me then,</v>

1094
00:51:12.161 --> 00:51:13.050
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1095
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.670
<v Speaker 2>throw that Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like me tossing my dick out.</v>

1096
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Very nice ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walsall smothered in Amygdala</v>

1097
00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:22.770
<v Speaker 1>by law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you like about you?</v>

1098
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.290
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of archetype</v>

1099
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.103
<v Speaker 2>the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shadow is so interested in chorus </v>

1100
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.370
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101
00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Freud wanted to be a neurologist but you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't find a live brain,</v>

1102
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was guessing there is no Edd,</v>

1103
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.380
<v Speaker 2>there is no metaphors and similes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphors.</v>

1104
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And he was kind of spot on too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he went to literal.</v>

1105
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Whereas there is something that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical,</v>

1106
00:51:47.461 --> 00:51:50.160
<v Speaker 2>that isn't neuroscience of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>

1107
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.710
<v Speaker 2>that lives below as something looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1108
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.380
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's my addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's the rage,</v>

1109
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that when the mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>does meet it,</v>

1110
00:51:58.021 --> 00:52:01.320
<v Speaker 2>the light shines on the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a kind of piece.</v>

1111
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.950
<v Speaker 2>And that is mindfulness too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dark meeting,</v>

1112
00:52:04.951 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:06.930
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1114
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.450
<v Speaker 2>it's the anima and the animus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a marriage.</v>

1115
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.890
<v Speaker 2>And so resident fighting yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those abusive thoughts,</v>

1116
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.950
<v Speaker 2>which I accept because if you get angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>at those thoughts,</v>

1117
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.610
<v Speaker 2>this is a more mundane quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you run from the monster,</v>

1118
00:52:20.611 --> 00:52:23.130
<v Speaker 2>it chases you and if you face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs from you.</v>

1119
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.190
<v Speaker 2>So there's a marriage and he was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much about,</v>

1120
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male and the female side,</v>

1121
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.200
<v Speaker 2>the dark and the light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's as far as I can take it.</v>

1122
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.880
<v Speaker 2>He was right on the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1123
00:52:32.881 --> 00:52:35.610
<v Speaker 2>if that's not stealing from Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was into Mondalez.</v>

1124
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.250
<v Speaker 2>And of course archetypes is completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1125
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.970
<v Speaker 2>We aren't one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just ruby who's like at this age</v>

1126
00:52:41.971 --> 00:52:44.070
<v Speaker 2>and I don't feel female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

1127
00:52:44.071 --> 00:52:46.110
<v Speaker 2>If you woke me up at four in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

1128
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.033
<v Speaker 2>what sex are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd really have to say I don't know </v>

1129
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.093
<v Speaker 2>because I don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should understand we're not a </v>

1130
00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:55.020
<v Speaker 2>stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This body is a,</v>

1131
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 2>is always a cesspool of genes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1132
00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And I could pull a card at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm living proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a moron at it as a kid.</v>

1134
00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:05.814
<v Speaker 2>And then ended up in Oxford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck would have thought that </v>

1135
00:53:07.741 --> 00:53:08.574
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just if you let it go and you </v>

1136
00:53:10.531 --> 00:53:12.750
<v Speaker 2>really study because it ain't coming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1137
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.220
<v Speaker 2>That brain has got its neuroplastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can really develop this brain.</v>

1138
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.080
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be harder when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>

1139
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 2>But if I start learning Chinese and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>

1140
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.394
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I will have the wiring that a </v>

1141
00:53:23.821 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>30 year old doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect,</v>

1142
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.843
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>will suffer from mental health issues </v>

1143
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I attract them and obviously you do.</v>

1144
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my people.</v>

1145
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 3>So people can change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can change.</v>

1146
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 3>But let me just say with the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1147
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know about this.</v>

1148
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.260
<v Speaker 3>If you have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't think your way out of it.</v>

1149
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that mental illness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1150
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't get the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can lower the fear.</v>

1151
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 3>You can with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lower the shame.</v>

1152
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Which means that when I feel the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>nips of the depression coming,</v>

1153
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.533
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have a little bit of an </v>

1154
00:53:58.261 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 3>overview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what to do.</v>

1155
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't get busier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is usually my way to go.</v>

1156
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm perfectly fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show up at your,</v>

1157
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll say showed a bit of charity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe.</v>

1158
00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:08.784
<v Speaker 3>The puffin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I give a shit last time and I took </v>

1159
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:11.484
<v Speaker 3>up scuba diving at Christmas under </v>
<v Speaker 3>brightened pair to show everybody else </v>

1160
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:18.810
<v Speaker 3>and then you end up in an institution </v>
<v Speaker 3>for five months or take on a lot of work</v>

1161
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:19.883
<v Speaker 3>to get the cortisone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the very thing that's making </v>

1162
00:54:21.991 --> 00:54:23.820
<v Speaker 3>the depression about depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1163
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 3>So this time I see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shut everything down because I respect</v>

1164
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 3>that disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I checked into a little retreat,</v>

1165
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 3>no TV and I just sat and bit the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hurts like fuck,</v>

1166
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.900
<v Speaker 3>but it passed faster because the court </v>
<v Speaker 3>is always down and that's why Kabat Zinn</v>

1167
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:43.740
<v Speaker 3>worked with people in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Focus on the pain because if you don't,</v>

1168
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 3>your whole body is the essence of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Focus in on where it is.</v>

1169
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not completely depressed,</v>

1170
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:50.454
<v Speaker 3>but there is depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that doesn't mean I still take </v>

1171
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:55.650
<v Speaker 3>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a different relationship with</v>

1172
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:56.450
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>

1173
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.680
<v Speaker 3>that's really fascinating and really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really helpful.</v>

1174
00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:59.723
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm enjoying very much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation is the evident </v>

1175
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.760
<v Speaker 3>marriage between spirituality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

1176
00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:09.613
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel that this is going to play an </v>

1177
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 3>important part in our conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1178
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:13.974
<v Speaker 3>you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean culturally going forward </v>

1179
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 3>because my senses and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things we've been looking at continually</v>

1180
00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 3>over the course of these podcasts.</v>

1181
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:22.700
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1182
00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam Curtis,</v>

1183
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:25.380
<v Speaker 3>it was that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1184
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 3>the old thing is dead and the new thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>has not yet been born.</v>

1185
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 3>And like we're the age of managerial </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

1186
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:35.220
<v Speaker 3>this age of bogus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized religion,</v>

1187
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:36.203
<v Speaker 3>all these things coming to a halt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are looking for ways to connect </v>

1188
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 3>with their essence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ways to understand their story.</v>

1189
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:46.860
<v Speaker 3>But it's got to have the right language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a feel real.</v>

1190
00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.530
<v Speaker 3>People can't pose through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I sent that.</v>

1191
00:55:49.531 --> 00:55:50.364
<v Speaker 3>There's much in this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've talked about are around union </v>

1192
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.653
<v Speaker 3>archetypes are mostly because we need a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to access the mystery and the </v>

1193
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean a woo woo thing.</v>

1194
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a terrain that can never be </v>

1195
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 3>contained by our limited capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

1196
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:09.560
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

1197
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.453
<v Speaker 3>I might be pulling this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't going in this direction is </v>

1198
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 3>this all comes down to it are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are working to as a tribe.</v>

1199
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.013
<v Speaker 3>It all went wrong when we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we suddenly went agricultural and </v>

1200
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:22.883
<v Speaker 3>we lost each other and I think in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>world we're too isolated and I have </v>

1201
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:27.454
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these things called frazzled </v>

1202
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:31.340
<v Speaker 3>cafes were groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1203
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to swerve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just good.</v>

1204
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I always the real cure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real thing for compassion,</v>

1205
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.193
<v Speaker 3>this is the road is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we start to be human again with </v>

1206
00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1207
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:42.814
<v Speaker 3>meeting it's smaller groups maybe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing cocktail bullshit where you </v>

1208
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 3>have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's your kid?</v>

1209
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1210
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 3>life is hard enough when you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1211
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 3>It's completely superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

1212
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 3>from my experience in the theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set up these groups.</v>

1213
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Fresno Cafe Dot Org,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put down your name,</v>

1214
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.610
<v Speaker 3>we get in touch with you marks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spencer's gave me all their cafes.</v>

1215
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:04.443
<v Speaker 3>They shut it down and then groups of 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet every two weeks with a facilitator </v>

1216
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 3>and all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it breaks your heart.</v>

1217
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:13.330
<v Speaker 3>It's so touching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're scared in the beginning,</v>

1218
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 3>like little frail humans and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>ages,</v>

1219
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.930
<v Speaker 3>all colors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you know.</v>

1220
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:22.140
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly they start to speak human </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say they're not mentally ill.</v>

1221
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.590
<v Speaker 3>They're like all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1222
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:27.430
<v Speaker 3>they opened their hearts and by the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave they're all holding hands.</v>

1223
00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:29.280
<v Speaker 3>They've exchanged phone numbers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've.</v>

1224
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.363
<v Speaker 3>Some groups have been going for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have their tried and I know that </v>

1225
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 3>that's part of all this is that we're so</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone and nobody's comparing notes.</v>

1226
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're quite right about like.</v>

1227
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.363
<v Speaker 3>So you found out Harare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on and just talk to us through the </v>

1228
00:57:48.151 --> 00:57:48.984
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the driving ideas in his book </v>

1229
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:53.290
<v Speaker 3>sapiens is how the advent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>

1230
00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously an economically lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion meant a huge.</v>

1231
00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:58.423
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the expert mentors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if people urbanizing coming together </v>

1232
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 3>and people becoming sort of units in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>

1233
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 3>as opposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing a certain necessary essential</v>

1234
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:14.041
<v Speaker 3>connection that lucky he explained to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that book agricultural works for one</v>

1235
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Straw society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work for the majority.</v>

1236
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Now bumped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bumped it up,</v>

1237
00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:19.744
<v Speaker 3>bumping up and technology works for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many things just like they needed to go </v>

1238
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:28.260
<v Speaker 3>into the architectural stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we are.</v>

1239
00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.183
<v Speaker 3>Our brain is still caveman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to adjust to this </v>

1240
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:33.260
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this technical,</v>

1241
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.720
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1242
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.553
<v Speaker 3>this notion of theological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>continued progress is underwritten by </v>

1243
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:43.120
<v Speaker 3>the same idea as agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are progressing,</v>

1244
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:43.954
<v Speaker 3>we are going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that that requires a </v>

1245
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:51.961
<v Speaker 3>mechanistic and materialistic Veltin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue and to you say,</v>

1246
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:53.441
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1247
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a mystery.</v>

1248
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:55.683
<v Speaker 3>All the things that we access through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the senses on by Necessity Limited and </v>

1249
00:58:59.581 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 3>unless we find a route back to who we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1250
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:03.543
<v Speaker 3>who we are as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've wished something is like I have in </v>

1251
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:08.464
<v Speaker 3>my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a collective eyes to support groups and </v>

1252
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 3>community groups where we do talk to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>another and very open,</v>

1253
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 3>honest plane.</v>

1254
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Why are you lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like the gift of a of addiction in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my case,</v>

1256
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.633
<v Speaker 3>but I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing to stop us creating </v>

1257
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:28.140
<v Speaker 3>societies based on a different model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creating groups on a different model of,</v>

1258
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:29.103
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need an only commune on the economic </v>

1259
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:33.134
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly struck me recently how </v>

1260
00:59:35.031 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous the kids socializing shopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>malls,</v>

1261
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 3>that's where they go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not spending money,</v>

1262
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 3>you're not congregate in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not coming together so we can ran</v>

1263
00:59:44.061 --> 00:59:44.894
<v Speaker 3>sack and attack religious institutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>or we like and God knows how corrupt </v>

1264
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:49.214
<v Speaker 3>they became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a place where people went </v>

1265
00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 3>together to do something other than buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>something exactly when.</v>

1266
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we had churches in a gathering,</v>

1267
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:59.203
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't need extraneous methods or a </v>

1268
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:06.881
<v Speaker 3>mental fitbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a community was being human.</v>

1269
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a group that's human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not an individual.</v>

1270
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.450
<v Speaker 3>An individual alone is like a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1271
01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:13.284
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the loneliness and know the being </v>

1272
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.270
<v Speaker 3>open to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked.</v>

1273
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.193
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to be contacting people and </v>

1274
01:00:20.001 --> 01:00:20.834
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going on in my mind is </v>

1275
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:22.844
<v Speaker 3>that what's going on in yours?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there will be such relief when that </v>

1276
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.054
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of this thing that </v>

1277
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Yanis Varoufakis said when they were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their egos?</v>

1278
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 3>The individually we exist in like he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a person that don't really,</v>

1279
01:00:33.321 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 3>like he said that he thinks matter came </v>
<v Speaker 3>before spirit.</v>

1280
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:39.690
<v Speaker 3>So I disagreed with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about consciousness must've come</v>

1281
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.690
<v Speaker 3>from matter rather than Matt coming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

1282
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.240
<v Speaker 3>but he said that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we exist in dialectic,</v>

1283
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.800
<v Speaker 3>that we exist in relationship to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1284
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 3>what is self if there aren't other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to relate to.</v>

1285
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 3>So our whole notion of what it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>an individual is wrong.</v>

1286
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.100
<v Speaker 3>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in your work long.</v>

1287
01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:56.934
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1288
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.033
<v Speaker 3>the mother builds the child's brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>through her reaction that a kid is just </v>

1289
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:06.320
<v Speaker 3>a blob of fat unless the mother starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was my case,</v>

1290
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:10.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she tries to keep me up and then dressed</v>

1291
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.953
<v Speaker 3>me and gave me these hideous haircuts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was sent to school as a blob of </v>

1292
01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1293
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only way a human being is molded</v>

1294
01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:21.890
<v Speaker 3>is through the compassion and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion of the mother.</v>

1295
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.350
<v Speaker 3>She teaches the kid what it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

1296
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.270
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this expression,</v>

1297
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 3>we work like neuro Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was in a rural state,</v>

1298
01:01:29.661 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I pass it straight to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we infect each other,</v>

1299
01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:35.870
<v Speaker 3>but we could infect each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe with things like mindfulness,</v>

1300
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I can only teach you compassion and give</v>
<v Speaker 3>you compassion.</v>

1301
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Now I can't do it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if my,</v>

1302
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:43.880
<v Speaker 3>if the certain and there are chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>

1303
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:47.160
<v Speaker 3>then oxytocin switches on chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals very.</v>

1304
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I like a nice bit of Mumbo jumbo of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning on a good road,</v>

1305
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:55.040
<v Speaker 3>but a good ball when you get that sexy </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1306
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to say.</v>

1307
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:57.884
<v Speaker 3>There is no consciousness involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something goes a little bit of juice </v>

1308
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:03.360
<v Speaker 3>goes to the penile area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about sex rule,</v>

1309
01:02:03.361 --> 01:02:04.194
<v Speaker 3>but you did that all in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Mumbo jumbo means a rhubarb </v>

1310
01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Halabaloo no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no monkey business.</v>

1311
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.930
<v Speaker 3>I meant the monkey business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1312
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.843
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying compassion is could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduced to a chemical and we do talk </v>

1313
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.120
<v Speaker 3>about in relationships like</v>

1314
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.383
<v Speaker 1>why chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do they come from and what holds </v>

1315
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What invisible grid.</v>

1316
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as smart as you.</v>

1317
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mess.</v>

1318
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Finally we agree on my pencil in </v>
<v Speaker 1>egotistical.</v>

1319
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm indulgence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you going to really be?</v>

1320
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to say.</v>

1321
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I like that thing you were just ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>on about that.</v>

1322
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>We find it difficult to individually </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate because like when something happens</v>

1323
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>around me and my parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see it objectively because </v>

1324
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>they are immeshed in the self that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessing it.</v>

1325
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:52.973
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got go because literally there </v>

1326
01:02:55.251 --> 01:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm wrapping this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I want to,</v>

1327
01:02:56.911 --> 01:02:57.744
<v Speaker 1>but because it's my train produces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says you've got to get train in 25 </v>

1328
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.064
<v Speaker 1>minutes to go to east bumfuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine why I'm spreading the </v>

1329
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:06.110
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and saw.</v>

1333
01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:16.550
<v Speaker 1>To me it's a meeting of mind and ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The perfect marriage.</v>

1334
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1337

<v Speaker 1>but then mind is sort of all </v>
