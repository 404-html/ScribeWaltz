<v Speaker 1>Adam Curtis.</v>

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you see century of the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mayfair set?</v>

26
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I've seen all them things and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>why a much more clever than what you are</v>

27
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.903
<v Speaker 1>in this episode of under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Adam about what all manner </v>

28
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>of things actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a brilliant political mind.</v>

29
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>If you want to understand what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the boat,</v>

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brexit,</v>

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.563
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that media news narratives or </v>

32
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>contrived conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their value,</v>

33
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>then you could do a lot worse than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch Adam courtesies films.</v>

34
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.834
<v Speaker 1>I've become friends with him actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find them to be an absolute </v>

35
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>darling man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

36
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:02.364
<v Speaker 1>You may not know that he was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>made films for that life and that if </v>

37
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you're a person that's about my age who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born in the seventies or eighties,</v>

38
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>you meant protocol.</v>

39
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>That's life of restaurants and where she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get sort of like,</v>

40
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good news type stories like a dog.</v>

41
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.424
<v Speaker 1>Don't start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same sausage is sort of pap </v>

42
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>mindlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Adam coast made that,</v>

43
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but he went on to be one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrators of our complex media age.</v>

44
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're an American listener and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar of Adam's work,</v>

45
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you want to get familiar with it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now by checking out his blog.</v>

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.223
<v Speaker 1>he's a fantastic storyteller on great </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of cultural events such as a </v>

48
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.453
<v Speaker 1>leaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like defining events such as nine slash </v>

49
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.174
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grip of the Berlin Wall coming down </v>

50
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and it gives us an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective there.</v>

51
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Check out his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check out this interview,</v>

52
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>remember to go and give me a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive review.</v>

53
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>You're listened to Russell brand under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the skin.</v>

54
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.313
<v Speaker 1>I've been giving you your intro the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time that you've been shambling </v>

55
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:55.924
<v Speaker 1>through the corridor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a gray ghost laundry like </v>

56
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Marley,</v>

57
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.123
<v Speaker 2>with the chains being your own archive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying most wonderful things about </v>

58
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 2>hypernormalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean that we're living in an</v>

59
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>unreal world as some sort of simulate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by it?</v>

60
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>What is the point of this film?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypernormalization.</v>

61
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Tell us what you mean.</v>

62
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.430
<v Speaker 3>What I remember happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's done.</v>

63
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.883
<v Speaker 3>What I meant by hypernormalisation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it got the term comes from a guy </v>

64
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.533
<v Speaker 3>rather than just guy who write about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was like to live in the Soviet </v>

65
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.263
<v Speaker 3>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That late in the middle of the 19 eight </v>

66
00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:35.454
<v Speaker 3>is where the Soviet Union was collapsing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it wasn't really any protest at </v>

67
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:40.074
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he pointed out he is that </v>

68
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 3>everyone knew that everything was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

69
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.660
<v Speaker 3>They knew that those in control had no </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

70
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They knew that those running the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>

71
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.553
<v Speaker 3>we're not in control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everything was corrupt and often </v>

72
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.660
<v Speaker 3>completely faked because the leaders </v>
<v Speaker 3>were pretending they were in control.</v>

73
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew this and the leaders knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

74
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody did anything about it because</v>

75
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.423
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was normal and he coined the phrase </v>

76
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 3>hypernormalization to describe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somehow you knew that everything was</v>

77
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 3>a bit odd and a bit unreal and often </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake,</v>

78
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 3>but because there was no other picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world and you were so within this</v>

79
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:21.774
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you accepted it as normal and just went </v>

80
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 3>on and what I'm trying to argue in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>room is not in any way.</v>

81
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 3>We're like the Soviet Union were a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different society,</v>

82
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.913
<v Speaker 3>but what we do share with that time is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense among a lot of people that things </v>

83
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:37.104
<v Speaker 3>are a bit odd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unreal and sometimes fake and those </v>

84
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 3>in charge know that they're not in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge and they know that.</v>

85
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 3>We know they're not in charge of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everything is a bit chaotic,</v>

86
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Speaker 3>uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We distrust everyone in charge.</v>

87
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.283
<v Speaker 3>We also know those in charge allow a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great deal of corruption to carry on </v>

88
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.443
<v Speaker 3>without doing much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that they're not in control of </v>

89
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 3>their economy and they know we're not in</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

90
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.663
<v Speaker 3>They know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know they're not in control of the </v>

91
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 3>economy and in that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time we.</v>

92
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.393
<v Speaker 3>We are so much a part of that system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't have any vision of an </v>

93
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 3>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I include by that the left,</v>

94
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.850
<v Speaker 3>the people who argue that they do want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change things,</v>

95
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.340
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a vision of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative.</v>

96
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 3>So we accepted as normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>

97
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 3>when you see another newspaper article </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out saying,</v>

98
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were actually supplying arms to the</v>

99
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Yemen to allow the Saudis to bomb Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go,</v>

100
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we sort of expect.</v>

101
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:37.584
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

102
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.483
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean because I did hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were supplying arms to the </v>

103
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Saudis to bomb Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a day on a four.</v>

104
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

105
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.693
<v Speaker 3>A very good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reaction is the most interesting </v>

106
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 3>thing of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sort of expected the,</v>

107
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.363
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arms industry and the government in </v>

108
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.654
<v Speaker 3>this country would allegedly allow arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be supplied to this war that we know </v>

109
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 3>is causing horrific civilian deaths and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no way of controlling it.</v>

110
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 3>We know that and we just accepted it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

111
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 3>but actually it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

112
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 3>But we know that however much we feel it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be wrong,</v>

113
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 3>nothing's going to change.</v>

114
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Is it a condition of five?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normalization then Adam impotence.</v>

115
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 3>It is impotence in the face of a chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

116
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.040
<v Speaker 3>We think that was in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no control over,</v>

117
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but we accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just impotent,</v>

118
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 3>it's we're passive and we accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a way we are as complicit in it as</v>

119
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:39.324
<v Speaker 3>our leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but but we do that because no one has </v>

120
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 3>gives us any alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We accept it as just normal.</v>

121
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 3>When the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have an alternative,</v>

122
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:52.320
<v Speaker 3>you can see suddenly something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It puts it in perspective.</v>

123
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 3>You've got an alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

124
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 3>you see things truly for what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can pull back,</v>

125
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.944
<v Speaker 3>detach and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that this is better or you </v>

126
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.490
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the moment there isn't an.</v>

127
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.324
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the great faults lies </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the left who say they do one </v>

128
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.253
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the real changing moment is </v>

129
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:09.834
<v Speaker 3>coming from a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird mixture of right wing nationalism </v>

130
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 3>and racism as far as I can see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

131
00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:17.460
<v Speaker 3>but they're failing to offer any </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative.</v>

132
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternative visions is that what you're </v>

133
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:20.734
<v Speaker 2>saying is that the alternative visions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are always going to come from the </v>

134
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.913
<v Speaker 2>periphery or from the subculture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the left is unable to provide a </v>

135
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.590
<v Speaker 2>legitimate and genuine alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are in fact involved in it</v>

136
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.753
<v Speaker 3>rhetorical exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it feels more and more like </v>

137
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.780
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

138
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:37.614
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I point out in the film how strange it </v>

139
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:39.654
<v Speaker 3>is that in the recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the attempts to change the world </v>

140
00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:44.574
<v Speaker 3>radically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had a great deal of force behind </v>

141
00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:47.700
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The occupy movement,</v>

142
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.150
<v Speaker 3>the Arab spring and tire square in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular in Egypt,</v>

143
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.450
<v Speaker 3>seretse in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of stalled.</v>

144
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.373
<v Speaker 3>They had great power behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had great goodwill behind them and </v>

145
00:07:58.471 --> 00:07:59.304
<v Speaker 3>they stalled and I argue in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they confuse process with </v>

146
00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:06.270
<v Speaker 3>content that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They they assembled.</v>

147
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.133
<v Speaker 3>They were very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a great slogan behind them in </v>

148
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:09.484
<v Speaker 3>the occupy movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great deal of emotional goodwill from </v>

149
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:12.294
<v Speaker 3>people who would not normally support </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary movements and they just </v>

150
00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:15.834
<v Speaker 3>stopped.</v>

151
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So what I said that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things.</v>

152
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells us the,</v>

153
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.301
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

154
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 2>the bleak observation one can make is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is no coherent,</v>

155
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.813
<v Speaker 2>clear alternative vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing is that there is a </v>

156
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:28.384
<v Speaker 2>desire for change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the positive thing that we can </v>

157
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:31.624
<v Speaker 2>draw from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when all put their mouse or </v>

158
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:38.440
<v Speaker 2>whatever rises up in those cases from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose I'm more close to there,</v>

159
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:39.274
<v Speaker 2>to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not a traditional leftist movement </v>

160
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>because it's embracing technology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of populism.</v>

161
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 2>In some ways it seems novel if not </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely new.</v>

162
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

163
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.760
<v Speaker 2>there is a genuine appetite for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

164
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you imagine Adam is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

165
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>what is the problem that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean in a way,</v>

166
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

167
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 3>would we expect if the world is changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>as radically as it is,</v>

168
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.203
<v Speaker 3>if it's a result of technology and sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a racing or rapidly advancing </v>

169
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.923
<v Speaker 3>economic realities that are conventional</v>
<v Speaker 3>and traditional left would be the </v>

170
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would we imagine that?</v>

171
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>

172
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.643
<v Speaker 3>these are centuries old ideas that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>not been modified it because we're no </v>

173
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 3>longer living in a version of 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century capitalism are we.</v>

174
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:26.731
<v Speaker 3>So why would like so why would a 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century socialism be a response to it?</v>

175
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.343
<v Speaker 3>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I argue in the film where I try and </v>

176
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate journalistically in the film</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know we're not living in the old</v>

177
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 3>idea of capitalism than we used to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

178
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 3>What we've shifted into is a a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>system of power,</v>

179
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 3>which I see as being fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>managerial.</v>

180
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 3>It's the reverse new bureaucracies </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us,</v>

181
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.183
<v Speaker 3>including things on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also in finance and in and in </v>

182
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Speaker 3>management systems in all the closest </v>
<v Speaker 3>that many people work in.</v>

183
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 3>The aim is to essentially keep the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>staple.</v>

184
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what finance is desperate </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>

185
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 3>It's always wanting to monitor the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

186
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Looking for risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Risk is a fascinating word.</v>

187
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.303
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

188
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>This is Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a word search on Lexisnexis,</v>

189
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 3>which is the cuttings filed of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspapers up until about 1988,</v>

190
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.920
<v Speaker 3>1990.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word risk hardly features in German,</v>

191
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.803
<v Speaker 3>so obviously there and then suddenly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nineties it rises up and it's this </v>

192
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 3>what drives modern managerial </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism.</v>

193
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.921
<v Speaker 3>If you can give it a word like that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this desire to avoid instability,</v>

194
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>to analyze the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for patterns that are happening now</v>

195
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.200
<v Speaker 3>that looked like dangers in the past and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then adjust that.</v>

196
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 3>There's always a sort of a right thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>

197
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.633
<v Speaker 3>and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it in our own personalities as </v>

198
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.134
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a right way to be </v>

199
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 3>psychologically.</v>

200
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 3>There's always a right body mass index </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have.</v>

201
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 3>There is always the right stable thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be understand.</v>

202
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to insert for like first </v>
<v Speaker 3>availity.</v>

203
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.950
<v Speaker 3>One can place conservatism keep things </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they are.</v>

204
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.913
<v Speaker 3>Stop things from changing over that </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily mean conservative in the </v>

205
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 3>conventional political conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

206
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean don't let things change and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk,</v>

207
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 3>the tool that's being used to preserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>this basis it fear is a synonym.</v>

208
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 3>So the fear is being used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fear of change.</v>

209
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it's very deep.</v>

210
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Not just within the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset,</v>

211
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 3>but also within the liberal mindset in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our society is fear of change.</v>

212
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Look what happens when you try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>change things.</v>

213
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.543
<v Speaker 3>They point to Iraq for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what happens when you try and </v>

214
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 3>change a country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They point to nature and they say,</v>

215
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 3>look what happens when you try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>change an ecosystem.</v>

216
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.640
<v Speaker 3>You can never tell the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

217
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 3>And then they point back and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

218
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 3>look what you try and do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian revolution.</v>

219
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.463
<v Speaker 3>Look what happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you always have this constant being </v>

220
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 3>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what you tried to do the,</v>

221
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

222
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.463
<v Speaker 3>but what they ignore is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in a society that comes out of </v>

223
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 3>a revolution which has got fantastic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful freedoms at it.</v>

224
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 3>It we had a revolution in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be good,</v>

225
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.973
<v Speaker 3>but it can be dangerous at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in a static world where were </v>

226
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:07.234
<v Speaker 3>absolutely terrified of all change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas someone like me would argue is </v>

227
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 3>the change can be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but can also be thrilling.</v>

228
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.401
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

229
00:12:13.401 --> 00:12:14.061
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

230
00:12:14.061 --> 00:12:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Someone like he would argue that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

231
00:12:15.831 --> 00:12:19.640
<v Speaker 2>what I think is very interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying Mr Curtis is that,</v>

232
00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:23.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when I listened to the arguments</v>

233
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.353
<v Speaker 2>that can be sort of rather complex on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things I very much enjoyed about </v>

234
00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:27.614
<v Speaker 2>your films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there the accessibility and the </v>

235
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.480
<v Speaker 2>populism probably coming from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>inaugural sausages,</v>

236
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.250
<v Speaker 2>the movie in which a deluxe says </v>
<v Speaker 2>sausages or seems to because Mr Darcy,</v>

237
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:41.480
<v Speaker 2>she revealed to me that the man </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulates the docs larynx.</v>

238
00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:43.170
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably wouldn't have said so.</v>

239
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I suggest if left alone long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

240
00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I think what is the ultimate resource if</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>

241
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.140
<v Speaker 2>and don't be afraid of a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

242
00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Adam Curtis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a little pal?</v>

243
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.583
<v Speaker 2>Allow the GNOMIC peculiar presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Elfin presence of mischief to be </v>

244
00:12:58.851 --> 00:13:01.850
<v Speaker 2>present in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow a tender law to,</v>

245
00:13:01.851 --> 00:13:02.684
<v Speaker 2>to advance up your thigh high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the on pondering whether you use comedy </v>

246
00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:10.250
<v Speaker 2>as a way of defense.</v>

247
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I use it as a means for attack as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact.</v>

248
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.380
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was saying is,</v>

249
00:13:15.381 --> 00:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>is that all of these things come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the personal.</v>

250
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 2>But when you talk about keep things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

251
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.820
<v Speaker 2>because one of the themes of your ipad </v>
<v Speaker 2>normalization is we're saying,</v>

252
00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:23.840
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like,</v>

253
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politicians aren't powerful.</v>

254
00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:26.960
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the great tropes of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

255
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:27.933
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you switch out </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameron for Theresa May or indeed </v>

256
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:30.614
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a self seems to be some </v>

257
00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:32.534
<v Speaker 2>self regulating system that asserts </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability regardless of what a opposing </v>

258
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 2>force a place in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're like,</v>

259
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then is a certain.</v>

260
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.753
<v Speaker 2>There's power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is this power upon which we can't </v>

261
00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:44.444
<v Speaker 2>get any purchase that evidently isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>the political establishment as we </v>

262
00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is this power actually situated?</v>

263
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>

264
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.943
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the money is the great economic </v>

265
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.770
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Global economic interest.</v>

266
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:57.330
<v Speaker 2>This is a good place to start as any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's</v>

267
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.803
<v Speaker 3>John bureaucracies are grown up which </v>
<v Speaker 3>are intimately related to our politics </v>

268
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.280
<v Speaker 3>like finance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

269
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.343
<v Speaker 3>the interesting thing about the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties is everyone thinks that </v>

270
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:08.134
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher Reagan really were successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But actually if you look back and </v>

271
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 3>increasingly historians looking back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

272
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't they,</v>

273
00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 3>they came in saying they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate industry.</v>

274
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>But by about 1986,</v>
<v Speaker 3>87,</v>

275
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.263
<v Speaker 3>most of the industry is in Britain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>America had collapsed because of the </v>

276
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:22.474
<v Speaker 3>economic experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what factor and Reagan did was they </v>

277
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 3>said they turned to finance and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

278
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.313
<v Speaker 3>can you help us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is effectually what </v>

279
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what finance did said is,</v>

280
00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll lend the money.</v>

281
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Wages weren't going up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wages.</v>

282
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 3>We're actually collapsing at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened is you had a switch and</v>

283
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:40.654
<v Speaker 3>they gave power to finance and finance </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in an introduced the idea of </v>

284
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 3>lending on a much grander scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the politicians allowed that because</v>

285
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 3>they facilitated all sorts of new acts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of parliament</v>

286
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.113
<v Speaker 2>that allowed for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you've got is a shift away from </v>

287
00:14:56.181 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you are on a constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>travelator have increased wages,</v>

288
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 2>increased security in the industries you</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked in,</v>

289
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

290
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.643
<v Speaker 2>your income stagnated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was supplemented by lending </v>

291
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So finance,</v>

292
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a great deal of power now.</v>

293
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Underlying finance is a deep desire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the world stable,</v>

294
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.023
<v Speaker 2>to avoid chaotic situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we began to move into that world </v>

295
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:26.231
<v Speaker 2>where we're always trying to avoid risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What then that happens is that that idea</v>

296
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:27.674
<v Speaker 2>begins to spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just literally in terms of you </v>

297
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:31.064
<v Speaker 2>lending money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea avoiding risk becomes a </v>

298
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 2>central thing in our society and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue that we've all become terrified of</v>

299
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:38.190
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

300
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's conservative,</v>

301
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

302
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've intuited,</v>

303
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 2>but not yet fully articulate it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it's rather complex and have a</v>

304
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:47.624
<v Speaker 2>tendency to be a bit sort of a ad hoc </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot from the hip of spit from the lip </v>

305
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>ask questions later.</v>

306
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Type of a character is that Qa chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their use of chaos is required.</v>

307
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.813
<v Speaker 2>That there's this sense in me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>induction of chaos will be beneficial </v>

308
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>when looking at this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemporary politics.</v>

309
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:05.684
<v Speaker 2>I've felt as you have articulated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my own experience with the truth </v>

310
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:08.864
<v Speaker 2>and one of the reasons I was very keen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have you as a guest as a matter of </v>

311
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:10.934
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is of course like a sort of like </v>

312
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 2>waist deep in like the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

313
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.943
<v Speaker 2>get an ed miliband round the flat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewing him and sort of being very </v>

314
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>outspoken in what became a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>combatative.</v>

315
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.323
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want to say dialect it kind of </v>

316
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>difficult exchange with Britain's media </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

317
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 2>is that I felt like this is really hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get any traction.</v>

318
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 2>It felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt very quickly myered,</v>

319
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like being around like the political</v>

320
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:36.380
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

321
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 2>It will be briefly around Ed miliband </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cheeks.</v>

322
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:40.214
<v Speaker 2>It felt like this doesn't seem like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt like a very sort of a kind of </v>

323
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 2>jangly and neurotic sort of Coterie of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I didn't think like,</v>

324
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the advancement of power.</v>

325
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 2>And then from being the recipient of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

326
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:51.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

327
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

328
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 2>what I would say a curtailing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>managing forces from the media.</v>

329
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.423
<v Speaker 2>That was interesting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt like it's so interesting to </v>

330
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.334
<v Speaker 2>become the subject of such negativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only from sort of established media </v>

331
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 2>but from people in general because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about change,</v>

332
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about letting you know,</v>

333
00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:09.924
<v Speaker 2>like people like it's very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what I felt like he's like in the </v>

334
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 2>story of the emperor's new clothes is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

335
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 2>In the end you'd say that kid just shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

336
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Stop saying that about the emperor </v>
<v Speaker 2>parades like the in the.</v>

337
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And people get angry to let people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry with you.</v>

338
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 2>If you say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

339
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.830
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any difference who you vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

340
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>you'll get the same political system </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

341
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>People know that's true and they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong.</v>

342
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.643
<v Speaker 2>And so they become angry with in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>case me for saying it instead of like </v>

343
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:37.574
<v Speaker 2>sort of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well bloody hell that is a pain in the </v>

344
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's reality that that's true.</v>

345
00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

346
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know now I find myself interested in</v>

347
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:48.210
<v Speaker 2>sort of bigger and broader topics like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 2>both historically and sort of a,</v>

349
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.863
<v Speaker 1>I know historically history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what is likely to be the next </v>

350
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:56.004
<v Speaker 1>transition given that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liking your film hypernormalization and </v>

351
00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.124
<v Speaker 1>like you've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that the political world is at </v>

352
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>least a once removed narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to respond to protests,</v>

353
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to respond to activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It merely absorbs,</v>

354
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.770
<v Speaker 1>it digests seretse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably pajamas.</v>

355
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.763
<v Speaker 1>It can handle the occupy movement and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've said in a in hypernormalization </v>

356
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:18.504
<v Speaker 1>than in other aspects of your work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have got an established </v>

357
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which usually comes from religion,</v>

358
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:24.460
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

359
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people can go,</v>

360
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have got an idea.</v>

361
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamentalist Islam.</v>

362
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.363
<v Speaker 1>That those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas are more potent and </v>

363
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that we can learn from</v>

364
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that with take from that,</v>

365
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.763
<v Speaker 3>but you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that why it doesn't have any </v>

366
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:48.040
<v Speaker 3>traction change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's our fault as much as them.</v>

367
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.280
<v Speaker 3>You can't just blame the politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's us as well.</v>

368
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.080
<v Speaker 3>One of the great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous changes of our time is the rise</v>

369
00:18:56.081 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 3>of individualism is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started really in the 19 seventies in</v>

370
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.450
<v Speaker 3>modern terms and it's this idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I believe that what we want and what</v>

371
00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:08.530
<v Speaker 3>we think and what we feel is the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic thing and we shouldn't be told</v>

372
00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:11.770
<v Speaker 3>what to do by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really strong.</v>

373
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 3>It's really powerful and it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

374
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.333
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Dutcher was on the coat tails of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punk movement was on the coat tails of </v>

375
00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:19.204
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

376
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.480
<v Speaker 3>It's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It dominates our society and the problem</v>

377
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.500
<v Speaker 3>for politics of the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individualism is that it can't deal with</v>

378
00:19:27.911 --> 00:19:28.744
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politics requires you to say to people </v>

379
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:34.120
<v Speaker 3>as a political party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come with me,</v>

380
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.193
<v Speaker 3>join with us together and we will use </v>
<v Speaker 3>that collective power to change the </v>

381
00:19:38.081 --> 00:19:38.914
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

382
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.100
<v Speaker 3>But to do that you have to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're part of something.</v>

383
00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:43.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to surrender yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

384
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.960
<v Speaker 3>And for the radical movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a disaster,</v>

385
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 3>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a disaster for politics generally</v>

386
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Speaker 3>because political parties understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>fell away.</v>

387
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.910
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then politicians there.</v>

388
00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Let me finish what politicians being </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>

389
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Paxman no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

390
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.393
<v Speaker 3>This is important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think because it's not </v>

391
00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:07.960
<v Speaker 3>just the politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they were then faced by is the fact</v>

392
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:08.794
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't have mass support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they couldn't do the main thing that </v>

393
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:18.190
<v Speaker 3>mass democratic politics rose up to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to be your representative,</v>

394
00:20:18.191 --> 00:20:19.024
<v Speaker 3>your bridgehead into power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we had become like scurrying </v>

395
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.723
<v Speaker 3>little piglet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going all over the world and not </v>

396
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.733
<v Speaker 3>have become a Skyrim piglet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a strident cantaloupe and not </v>

397
00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 3>joining together to form a collective </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

398
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>

399
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.720
<v Speaker 1>There's one thing I wanted to pick up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

400
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 1>When you say something that Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a popular podcast,</v>

401
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.613
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when me say something like the rise </v>

402
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>of individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>

403
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

404
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I think we can all say that I primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>my worldview comes from,</v>

405
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but I'm me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Russell,</v>

406
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I want this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

407
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

408
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.183
<v Speaker 1>So I've got feelings now like in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that people haven't </v>

409
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:56.014
<v Speaker 1>really examined individualism as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>component and a sort of an unavoidable </v>

410
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>evolution of a mechanistic worldview and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of materialism.</v>

411
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Now we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

412
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Like when they became chronic or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable in the seventies,</v>

413
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.014
<v Speaker 1>so my assumption would be then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these conditions of individualism is a </v>

414
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:13.954
<v Speaker 1>side effect of marketing of liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why is it convenient for </v>

415
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:18.694
<v Speaker 1>people to see themselves primarily as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals because that's how people </v>

416
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:22.100
<v Speaker 1>really are better.</v>

417
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:23.703
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a side effect of marketing </v>

418
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:29.701
<v Speaker 3>marketing comes in to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Individualism comes basically out of the</v>

419
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.694
<v Speaker 3>hippie movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the counterculture movement to the 19 </v>

420
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:36.901
<v Speaker 3>sixties where you were encouraged to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic by responding to yourself.</v>

421
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.303
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea and it was a reaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>against what was seen as conformity and </v>

422
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it was a reaction against old style of </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics where you were told what to do.</v>

423
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do what I want to be.</v>

424
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.090
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just that.</v>

425
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened and it was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding the authentic self.</v>

426
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was a</v>

427
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.400
<v Speaker 1>the defined as much as anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bites,</v>

428
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.340
<v Speaker 1>cohesion and bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pursuit of civil,</v>

429
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.203
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were people that were were like a </v>

430
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:07.630
<v Speaker 1>lot of change came out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a,</v>

431
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.330
<v Speaker 1>on a civil rights level in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

432
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

433
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.123
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that didn't come out of the hippie </v>

434
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the civil rights movement,</v>

435
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 3>which is incredibly important movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the 19 fifties in the 19 sixties,</v>

436
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.503
<v Speaker 3>white activists and black activists </v>
<v Speaker 3>joined together and they spent years </v>

437
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.013
<v Speaker 3>giving their lives and many cases </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally up to try and change the </v>

438
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:30.814
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they did and they surrender </v>

439
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:33.584
<v Speaker 3>themselves to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of that civil rights movement came </v>

440
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.930
<v Speaker 3>what was called the new left and the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>left said,</v>

441
00:22:37.931 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can do this for civil rights,</v>

442
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:40.804
<v Speaker 3>we can do this for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the movement stalled somewhere </v>

443
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:44.584
<v Speaker 3>in the mid 19 sixties because what began</v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen was I knew what was called </v>

444
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:48.604
<v Speaker 3>counterculture rose up and the counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture was different for the new left </v>

445
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 3>because what the counterculture said </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

446
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to check all the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power.</v>

447
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 3>You haven't got the power to do it.</v>

448
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 3>The way to do it is to change yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the rise.</v>

449
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:03.964
<v Speaker 3>It was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the sign of a new individualists </v>

450
00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:07.064
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't want to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't want to go down to the south and </v>

451
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:13.660
<v Speaker 3>spend years at an anonymity in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to change the world.</v>

452
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.330
<v Speaker 3>It wanted to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

453
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go down to south New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York named Ian Danger.</v>

454
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.253
<v Speaker 3>If I might say say you are an arch </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of hyper individualism of our </v>

455
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that I'm going to write that down</v>

456
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:29.110
<v Speaker 3>or look out when I get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All your responses are characteristic of</v>

457
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>exactly what I'm describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what then happened is that the,</v>

458
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.193
<v Speaker 3>the the argument shifted away from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of saying we can work together to </v>

459
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:41.611
<v Speaker 3>change the world to saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can actually be be the vanguard of</v>

460
00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:44.530
<v Speaker 3>changing ourselves as people.</v>

461
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.793
<v Speaker 3>Then you change the Saatchi like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You change the people first and then </v>

462
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>society will transform and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>work for a bit,</v>

463
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 3>but then bit by bit the politics moved </v>
<v Speaker 3>away and you are left with this idea.</v>

464
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:58.664
<v Speaker 3>You just transform yourself and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these radical psychotherapy </v>

465
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>movements of the 19 seventies come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you need to find your authentic</v>

466
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:06.314
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That became the goal and the idea that </v>

467
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you actually changed his society as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>byproduct began to disappear,</v>

468
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.953
<v Speaker 3>and what then happened was that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange thing began to emerge is if you </v>

469
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 3>are going to be a self expressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>

470
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.473
<v Speaker 3>which was the ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're authentically expressing </v>

471
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how'd you do it?</v>

472
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Because actually not many people knew or</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the confidence to do that,</v>

473
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.143
<v Speaker 3>and I argued in a series of films I made</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that really what happened was the </v>

474
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 3>modern consumer capitalism said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can help you do that.</v>

475
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.550
<v Speaker 3>We can actually supply you with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things to allow you to express</v>

476
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:38.384
<v Speaker 3>yourself from ranges of cost ranges of </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to all sorts of products that you </v>

477
00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 3>can use to express your individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

478
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.993
<v Speaker 3>Which was fantastic for consumer </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism because they could make lots </v>

479
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:50.264
<v Speaker 3>more different things.</v>

480
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not saying then that consumer</v>

481
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:53.354
<v Speaker 2>is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that the consumer is in </v>

482
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Speaker 2>mass market culture was a response to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that need?</v>

483
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

484
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I like because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

485
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 2>a fan of the films of century of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Self,</v>

486
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.720
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't qualify me to know more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>

487
00:25:04.721 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 2>In the new [inaudible] you've made those</v>
<v Speaker 2>films but like what it means,</v>

488
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 2>but what how I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

489
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.013
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one level we're deal the source </v>

490
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:15.044
<v Speaker 2>material for all of this is human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling so even when you say something </v>

491
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:19.740
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an arch example of individualism.</v>

492
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.593
<v Speaker 2>For me that means that I'm closer to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the precipice of breaking through to </v>

493
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:25.184
<v Speaker 2>realizing the limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism and what the implications </v>

494
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 2>of the individualism is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Limits are which is transcendence.</v>

495
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.993
<v Speaker 2>What happens when one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once more transcends willingly and with </v>

496
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:36.854
<v Speaker 2>volition through the limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism and back to a communal </v>

497
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 2>experience and back to a cohesive </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as a member of a tribe have a</v>

498
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 2>community of a society.</v>

499
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Experiences that are somewhat the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a pathway to somewhat being dug up.</v>

500
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:50.384
<v Speaker 2>It's not so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer clear what is the </v>

501
00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 2>direction for people that feel this </v>
<v Speaker 2>yearning and feel the limitations of our</v>

502
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 2>experience of individuals of forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in our head,</v>

503
00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.693
<v Speaker 2>of living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our anxieties of not knowing what is </v>

504
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>real because we are living in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited version of what is real,</v>

505
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 2>the fulfillment of our base drives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>base desires.</v>

506
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a limited experience of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

507
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.561
<v Speaker 2>Who Will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

508
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:11.394
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropologically history historically </v>

509
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.563
<v Speaker 2>are designed to live communally </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected as a harmonious part of a </v>

510
00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:21.470
<v Speaker 2>group in a harmonious part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting for me about what</v>

511
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>

512
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 2>is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always regarded the consumerism and</v>

513
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.510
<v Speaker 2>mass market culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

514
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.483
<v Speaker 2>has recognized all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this need in people that can be </v>

515
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled through selling them stuff.</v>

516
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 2>But by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by your own unique ipad,</v>

517
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.130
<v Speaker 2>ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ipod,</v>

518
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.993
<v Speaker 2>by your own unique torn jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in culture and expressive </v>

519
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.263
<v Speaker 2>individualism for consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I suppose what we've not yet gotten </v>

520
00:26:45.801 --> 00:26:46.634
<v Speaker 2>to is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the architecture of these concepts if </v>

521
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

522
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.910
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's someone behind it </v>
<v Speaker 2>designing this or,</v>

523
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:56.843
<v Speaker 2>or some interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like when you're saying these </v>

524
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracies are organizing this state </v>
<v Speaker 2>system stability,</v>

525
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:04.140
<v Speaker 2>like the financial bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

526
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.003
<v Speaker 2>who benefits from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who benefits from people seeing </v>

527
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 2>themselves primarily as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it certainly isn't the people of</v>

528
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:14.520
<v Speaker 2>the Yemen and it certainly isn't us as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

529
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 2>So who is it that's preventing change </v>
<v Speaker 2>from happening?</v>

530
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

531
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Ask because we can say we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>participating in a,</v>

532
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.283
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a like a potent movement because one </v>

533
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem to currently exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is the.</v>

534
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this idea continuing to dominate?</v>

535
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I think the point is depart consumer </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism is capitalism is not a.</v>

536
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.720
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing inherently evil thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

537
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.573
<v Speaker 3>it's a moral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will always spot an opportunity and </v>

538
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:42.444
<v Speaker 3>it will go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what it spotted in the late 19 </v>

539
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.454
<v Speaker 3>seventies that were there were these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people rising up who wanted to be </v>

540
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:52.461
<v Speaker 3>themselves and they realize that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed you to make lots of a much wider</v>

541
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:53.964
<v Speaker 3>range of products that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>previously done before and people went </v>

542
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:57.744
<v Speaker 3>for it and that allowed capitalism to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make lots more money and become much </v>

543
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:01.260
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

544
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you saw those adverts in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

545
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 3>19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>express yourself,</v>

546
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.390
<v Speaker 3>be yourself through Nike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do it exactly because I'm worth.</v>

547
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:10.224
<v Speaker 3>It was the great phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then what happened was I think a </v>

548
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:17.120
<v Speaker 3>great shift happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we haven't fully recognized,</v>

549
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.973
<v Speaker 3>which is of what I'm trying to get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the film is that is the genius of </v>

550
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:22.224
<v Speaker 3>modern power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it managed to do what politics </v>

551
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:25.254
<v Speaker 3>failed to do.</v>

552
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.363
<v Speaker 3>Politics can't deal with individualism </v>
<v Speaker 3>because how can you have a political </v>

553
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 3>party where everyone wants to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and not be part of something?</v>

554
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 3>What modern manager or system has </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed to do with square the circle?</v>

555
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.230
<v Speaker 3>Look at modern social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It manages to allow you to feel that you</v>

556
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 3>are totally yourself expressing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

557
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 3>typing it angrily or beautifully or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to do out into the,</v>

558
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:54.150
<v Speaker 3>into the Internet what you feel or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time yet at the same time,</v>

559
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 3>what you are as a component and a series</v>
<v Speaker 3>of very complex circuits that is looking</v>

560
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:00.000
<v Speaker 3>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing that and saying,</v>

561
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's doing that,</v>

562
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 3>then he's very much like these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>over here,</v>

563
00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 3>which we've categorized like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we can say back to that person in the</v>

564
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:10.350
<v Speaker 3>circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing that,</v>

565
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:11.550
<v Speaker 3>would you like this as well?</v>

566
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.710
<v Speaker 3>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whew.</v>

567
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a bit like what you've just</v>

568
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:19.761
<v Speaker 3>done and it makes you sort of feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>secure within your individuality.</v>

569
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:20.723
<v Speaker 3>So what they've finished to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly in the modern systems of </v>

570
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:23.814
<v Speaker 3>management is except your individualism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your expressiveness allow you to </v>

571
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 3>feel that you're being more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressive.</v>

572
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Where's the same time managing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>quietly,</v>

573
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:34.104
<v Speaker 3>unhappily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you become part of a very large </v>

574
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:38.220
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That university because you are just the</v>

575
00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>little components and the circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the computers look at you and go,</v>

576
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.113
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's about 300 million of those </v>

577
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:47.060
<v Speaker 3>sort of types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're putting them in that group and I'm</v>

578
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 3>not a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a group of people going,</v>

579
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:50.344
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll do this.</v>

580
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.333
<v Speaker 3>It's a system that can see from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that it's reading from you </v>

581
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:56.643
<v Speaker 3>and lots of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patterns that you are part of and </v>

582
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:00.581
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

583
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 3>we'll fit them all together into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>

584
00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sort of complex interlocks,</v>

585
00:30:04.641 --> 00:30:06.530
<v Speaker 2>taxonomies that designed ultimately to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

586
00:30:06.531 --> 00:30:07.680
<v Speaker 2>if you like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your property,</v>

587
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.153
<v Speaker 3>that it's benign in terms the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you talk to the tech utopians from </v>

588
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.290
<v Speaker 3>from Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will go,</v>

589
00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.330
<v Speaker 3>this is incredibly efficient and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

590
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.343
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredibly efficient way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>managing the problem that politicians </v>

591
00:30:22.461 --> 00:30:23.294
<v Speaker 3>can't manage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is our individuality and our </v>

592
00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:27.980
<v Speaker 3>desire to be self expressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's problem is,</v>

593
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.360
<v Speaker 3>is that it's fundamentally conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's feeding back to you more of</v>

594
00:30:32.361 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 3>what it knows you like or things will </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

595
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it sounded like a bit like </v>

596
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.543
<v Speaker 3>Christianity in a way offered a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a peg around personal interaction </v>

597
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:43.424
<v Speaker 3>with Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your own person or salvation Christ </v>

598
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:46.910
<v Speaker 3>loves you as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

599
00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:51.440
<v Speaker 3>You could argue that modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>protestantism especially was again,</v>

600
00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:56.441
<v Speaker 3>another way of trying to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing desire for individuality,</v>

601
00:30:56.691 --> 00:30:57.524
<v Speaker 3>which has been going on since the </v>
<v Speaker 3>renaissance or before the enlightenment </v>

602
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.260
<v Speaker 3>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you want to be yourself?</v>

603
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.270
<v Speaker 3>So question to some said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

604
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.523
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be what Catholicism </v>
<v Speaker 3>says is just part of something you're </v>

605
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.673
<v Speaker 3>told to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a personal relationship to </v>

606
00:31:11.331 --> 00:31:12.164
<v Speaker 3>God and there is a very important posh </v>
<v Speaker 3>academic book written back in the early </v>

607
00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:18.104
<v Speaker 3>part of the 20th century which argues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my uncle Max Faber that argues that </v>

608
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.573
<v Speaker 3>protestantism and the idea that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a personal relationship to God was one </v>

609
00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:31.190
<v Speaker 3>of the great motor forces that allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism to come up because if you can</v>

610
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:32.024
<v Speaker 3>actually achieve a relationship through </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own actions with God and achieve </v>

611
00:31:37.131 --> 00:31:39.860
<v Speaker 3>salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can actually say what?</v>

612
00:31:39.861 --> 00:31:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I can achieve all sorts of things myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the here and now before I dive,</v>

613
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.400
<v Speaker 3>which may save me for when I die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it actually made you more of a heroic</v>

614
00:31:49.401 --> 00:31:50.234
<v Speaker 3>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protestantism certainly that advances </v>

615
00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:53.474
<v Speaker 3>the idea of individualism used their </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of star of your own life accruing </v>

616
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.780
<v Speaker 3>goods and services so that when you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you die,</v>

617
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:00.614
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be a good person and you will </v>

618
00:32:01.881 --> 00:32:02.714
<v Speaker 3>go to heaven and that gave capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that it was a fundamentally </v>

619
00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:09.710
<v Speaker 3>good thing to try and achieve you where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we will work,</v>

620
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.693
<v Speaker 3>and you'll see this in the 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>novels where they depict great </v>

621
00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:12.950
<v Speaker 3>capitalists.</v>

622
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.940
<v Speaker 3>They see themselves as heroic figures </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are not only helping the world,</v>

623
00:32:16.941 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but they're saving themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

624
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.913
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in a way don't we have to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the kind of a journalistic </v>

625
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.390
<v Speaker 2>judgment so of like ideas like </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>

626
00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:25.224
<v Speaker 2>socialism or any individual is either </v>
<v Speaker 2>good or bad sort of is it that we need </v>

627
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:31.314
<v Speaker 2>to sort of look up functionally what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurring or like this seems to have </v>

628
00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:34.704
<v Speaker 2>very positive results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems to very detrimental results </v>

629
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 2>and when you're talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>online collation and people put together</v>

630
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:44.681
<v Speaker 2>into 300 million man or woman hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be marketed to and as you say,</v>

631
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 2>it's benign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things,</v>

632
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 2>not this not happening in a vacuum is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is like,</v>

633
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 2>so when you're talking to these that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the exertion and that's the ex,</v>

634
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 2>that's the exercising of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're witnessing witnessing there,</v>

635
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:58.574
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not happening sort of in a </v>

636
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary and natural light because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's interests are being represented</v>

637
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 2>through those resources.</v>

638
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.943
<v Speaker 2>Facebook is not neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I'm sort of </v>

639
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 2>learning about because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to university,</v>

640
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.050
<v Speaker 2>she very kindly wrote me my reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>which have not yet seen and I would like</v>

641
00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:15.884
<v Speaker 2>to see because I want to know what kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things you said about me and sweet </v>

642
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.680
<v Speaker 2>and adorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet and adorable students.</v>

643
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I hope that I'm right now looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>context you're using that in.</v>

644
00:33:26.251 --> 00:33:27.990
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think that you fought sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and adorable.</v>

645
00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:29.700
<v Speaker 2>It was patronizing which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

646
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in a way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also being nice is patronizing.</v>

647
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:34.994
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm patronizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in one of the things I'm learning </v>

648
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:42.401
<v Speaker 2>about in that Adam Curtis is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way that secularism.</v>

649
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:46.620
<v Speaker 2>And just so for those of you that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>new listener to this type of podcast,</v>

650
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.833
<v Speaker 2>the division of Church and state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that division of political interest and </v>

651
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:55.751
<v Speaker 2>religious interest has always posed as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral force like addicts,</v>

652
00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.540
<v Speaker 2>expansionism and interventionism has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been justified by that we can go over to</v>

653
00:34:00.541 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and stick our origin because we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>a secular society,</v>

654
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:04.184
<v Speaker 2>a neutral society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing all sorts of Wacko </v>

655
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.763
<v Speaker 2>stuff with that where the government has</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a mustache and metal from that and </v>

656
00:34:10.061 --> 00:34:15.061
<v Speaker 2>they need to be brought down to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to now this a positive as neutral of a,</v>

657
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.043
<v Speaker 2>whether it's secularism or the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cyber world is one of the ways that </v>

658
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 2>power has always concealed itself by </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this isn't power tool,</v>

659
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 2>this is normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

660
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.120
<v Speaker 2>sort of social services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal markets.</v>

661
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 2>So sort of a sort of a capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>derived from protestantism,</v>

662
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.200
<v Speaker 2>normal Islam not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And therefore subject to regulation.</v>

663
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.490
<v Speaker 2>The threat someone wants to the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

664
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.353
<v Speaker 2>the sign of a great ideology is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that doesn't look like an </v>

665
00:34:41.811 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 2>ideology that you just accept as natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>and normal.</v>

666
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to technological enthusiasts</v>

667
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:50.774
<v Speaker 2>or utopians from Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you talking about facebook shutting </v>

668
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 2>people off into their own little echo </v>
<v Speaker 2>chambers,</v>

669
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.093
<v Speaker 2>but they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's sufficient and what they mean </v>

670
00:34:59.451 --> 00:35:02.870
<v Speaker 2>by that is it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually dealing with the problem I</v>

671
00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:03.704
<v Speaker 2>was talking about of individualism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's allowing people to be assembled in </v>

672
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:11.210
<v Speaker 2>groups yet feel individuals and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely right.</v>

673
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.073
<v Speaker 2>It is incredibly efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe the whole idea of efficiency </v>

674
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:16.364
<v Speaker 2>used in those terms is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political ideology because what they're </v>

675
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:19.814
<v Speaker 2>saying is we constantly keep people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation by reading stuff and </v>

676
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 2>feeding stuff to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's conservative.</v>

677
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a conservative idea because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people but get get,</v>

678
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.143
<v Speaker 2>they'd get frightened of change and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get frightened of change then you </v>

679
00:35:35.321 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>are actually feeding the power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I keep</v>

680
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 3>on trying to point out in this film is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the real power works not just,</v>

681
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work by saying you must do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

682
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.943
<v Speaker 3>it works well when we are complicit </v>
<v Speaker 3>within it because we accept it as </v>

683
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 3>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

684
00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 3>And we are guilty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

685
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 3>do you remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

686
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 3>March against the war in Iraq and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>London in 2003.</v>

687
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it was about 3 million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>went on that march was terrible.</v>

688
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.933
<v Speaker 3>Did you go on it?</v>

689
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I was still on drugs to care about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

690
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:12.204
<v Speaker 2>I think I did go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was still on drugs to care about </v>

691
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:15.234
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

692
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>march is it was really the biggest,</v>

693
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.134
<v Speaker 3>probably the biggest protest march since</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide thing in 1956 or even </v>

694
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.034
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone thought that's going to </v>

695
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 3>change everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

696
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone went and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>slogan which was not in my name,</v>

697
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 3>which is again a very individualistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it as a slogan to you.</v>

698
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in my name,</v>

699
00:36:33.611 --> 00:36:34.444
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the wild doubt my finishing </v>

700
00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:38.080
<v Speaker 3>your name I think because we've got some</v>
<v Speaker 3>more lemonade we got.</v>

701
00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:38.914
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it was an interesting slogan </v>

702
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:41.394
<v Speaker 3>of its time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the pomposity of it </v>

703
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.063
<v Speaker 3>sincerity you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone marched 3 million people march </v>

704
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 3>and they were totally sincere about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In my name.</v>

705
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And they then went home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

706
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not in your name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

707
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:53.604
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not important.</v>

708
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.513
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what what the profession </v>

709
00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:56.544
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go back and the war is not in my </v>

710
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:00.684
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you don't anything more </v>

711
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas real change,</v>

712
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:05.184
<v Speaker 3>real political change would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened if those 3 million people had </v>

713
00:37:08.071 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 3>again and again and again marched and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and worked and given themselves to</v>

714
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 3>that they might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I've had a chance of stopping.</v>

715
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 3>The horror has now happened in Iran.</v>

716
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit of my Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you argued before,</v>

717
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.003
<v Speaker 2>the stability is the enemy of change and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are obviously participants in this </v>

718
00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:22.934
<v Speaker 2>because we like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

719
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.773
<v Speaker 2>do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I will be going on a </v>

720
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.513
<v Speaker 2>million person March every day because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an x box and I'm moderately </v>

721
00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:32.080
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't in fact the ingenuity of a much of</v>

722
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:37.150
<v Speaker 2>contemporary secular life is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the significant majority.</v>

723
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.340
<v Speaker 2>We are sustained at a comfortable level </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can tolerate in our insular cells</v>

724
00:37:43.011 --> 00:37:43.844
<v Speaker 2>of comfort the discomfort of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because our empathy and altruism has </v>

725
00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:48.434
<v Speaker 2>been eroded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these impulses and instincts have long </v>

726
00:37:50.781 --> 00:37:53.690
<v Speaker 2>been undernourished because they're sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of familiar.</v>

727
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Communal institutions of themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>began to disappear.</v>

728
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.960
<v Speaker 2>What protest becomes feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

729
00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.853
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it does add him and actually that </v>

730
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:06.224
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be to our disadvantage because</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sort of talk about me as the </v>

731
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.373
<v Speaker 2>arch narcissist of our time on what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think this means is it's like that for </v>

732
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:15.984
<v Speaker 2>all things.</v>

733
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.103
<v Speaker 3>Returning to the point makes my point </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me that you are the narcissist of </v>

734
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:22.520
<v Speaker 3>our time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it as a passing comment.</v>

735
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:23.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

736
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:24.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I'm,</v>

737
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.103
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in because I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's legitimate as well as this </v>

738
00:38:28.731 --> 00:38:30.830
<v Speaker 2>sort of a blip aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

739
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.480
<v Speaker 2>that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it about my,</v>

740
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.580
<v Speaker 2>my personal conditions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions of our time that make soaks,</v>

741
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>that make me so infatuated with my cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

742
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 1>my own perceptions because in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that different from,</v>

743
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really from anybody else.</v>

744
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more pronounced,</v>

745
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 1>it's more observable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't imagine that.</v>

746
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:50.111
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

747
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:50.944
<v Speaker 1>how could anyone possibly know because </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one except me knows how to be inside </v>

748
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:53.974
<v Speaker 1>my own consciousness and I'm not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that I'm that convinced of how to </v>

749
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:56.940
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That my point,</v>

750
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.813
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that everything's a source is </v>

751
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 1>people's negotiation with the external </v>
<v Speaker 1>world at source.</v>

752
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:05.254
<v Speaker 1>Everything is the way I feel when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfacing with a society or another </v>

753
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:13.531
<v Speaker 1>human being or a product or my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings coming back to me and because I</v>

754
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.733
<v Speaker 1>have experienced many of the sort of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the icons of success or the </v>

755
00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 1>icons of consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 1>have been famous being a proper drug.</v>

757
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Addicts being proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous.</v>

758
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I've like seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh right,</v>

759
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:28.834
<v Speaker 1>these things are not that nutritional or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helpful is that he's helped me to </v>

760
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.683
<v Speaker 1>reach a point where I'm willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider ideas such as being part of a </v>

761
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.150
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

762
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and like isn't that is law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means surrender.</v>

763
00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

764
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:45.694
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the idea of surrender comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>up again and again in a sort of </v>

765
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 1>spiritual and religious ideologies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these drives.</v>

766
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the other one said to me like,</v>

767
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:53.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

768
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Speaker 1>we've been told that freedom is freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill,</v>

769
00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:56.674
<v Speaker 1>are trivial and petty desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but real freedom is freedom from our </v>

770
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 1>petty and trivial desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

771
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 1>in being able to sort of by yourself an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone or have a Wang in a train toilet,</v>

772
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of this as a kind of blissful </v>

773
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:09.064
<v Speaker 1>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what have you just fobbed yourself </v>

774
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 1>off with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>

775
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a 10 pound fine.</v>

776
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>No fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So serious.</v>

777
00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Why are you being so serious today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I decided.</v>

778
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.350
<v Speaker 3>You're the funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that doesn't matter.</v>

779
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.050
<v Speaker 3>We can all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can all be silly together.</v>

780
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the lights?</v>

781
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.970
<v Speaker 3>So the reason I'm using like returning </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a serious point at that point,</v>

782
00:40:29.971 --> 00:40:31.620
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was working serious is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

783
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.521
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

784
00:40:32.521 --> 00:40:33.354
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you've touched on something </v>

785
00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:38.571
<v Speaker 3>really important to note that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>to calm you down.</v>

786
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Honestly necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consider this a form of resuscitation.</v>

787
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.213
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this necessary was if you were lying on </v>

788
00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:51.780
<v Speaker 3>a beach now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are all clever in those edits with</v>

789
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.623
<v Speaker 3>your archive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really what he needs is a cuddle </v>

790
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 3>that come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm actually trying to show that</v>

791
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be controlled by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedic persona.</v>

792
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Power of comedy is very controlling </v>
<v Speaker 3>messages.</v>

793
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what I.</v>

794
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:09.120
<v Speaker 3>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I am as much a narcissist as you.</v>

795
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I want to set the agenda as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

796
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.500
<v Speaker 3>What I want you to see that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trail and what I wanted to point out was</v>

797
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 3>that it's not that there is the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of freedom isn't.</v>

798
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a religious one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of freedom.</v>

799
00:41:25.651 --> 00:41:26.484
<v Speaker 3>There are all different kinds of freedom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea of freedom that we believe </v>

800
00:41:29.671 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 3>in now and we believe is inevitable or </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural and natural to state is not.</v>

801
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.263
<v Speaker 3>It's a construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The version of us at the moment is a </v>

802
00:41:37.651 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 3>country of freedom is a construction </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are many others and one of</v>

803
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:42.494
<v Speaker 3>the most powerful is the very opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a religious one which says in </v>

804
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:47.354
<v Speaker 3>whose service is perfect freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what the religious idea is that </v>

805
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Speaker 3>the self which we worship at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually a terrible prison.</v>

806
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a cage that you are trapped and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

807
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:02.010
<v Speaker 3>you are an example of this in and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've taught them.</v>

808
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 3>A terrible presentation is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a young offenders,</v>

809
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 3>when you get trapped atriox short term </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires,</v>

810
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got,</v>

811
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:10.933
<v Speaker 3>you got locked acuitus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even your logically one could </v>

812
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>imagine that the process of consuming is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stimuli and response.</v>

813
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.073
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's good to escape from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily grind of having to listen to your </v>

814
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 3>consciousness constantly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want this.</v>

815
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:25.034
<v Speaker 3>I want this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want this.</v>

816
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Which we're encouraged to believe is </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberation.</v>

817
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not.</v>

818
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're quite right.</v>

819
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I like,</v>

820
00:42:31.101 --> 00:42:31.934
<v Speaker 2>I like Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of quite pop spiritual orators </v>

821
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:39.581
<v Speaker 2>such as Eckhart Tolle will say to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this incessant in a narrative,</v>

822
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the relentless thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no freedom in that,</v>

823
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some and watched where those thoughts</v>

824
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 2>take you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

825
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:46.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of,</v>

826
00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

827
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.963
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking my dog in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything's basically not the </v>

828
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This material reality is I am a man in a</v>

829
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 2>field with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in my head,</v>

830
00:42:55.431 --> 00:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

831
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 2>what did I do that for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will probably go wrong.</v>

832
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are those people over there,</v>

833
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not trying to stick again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeps bringing it back,</v>

834
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.353
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is that there is like a sort of </v>

835
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:08.690
<v Speaker 2>a self imposed tyranny to that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

836
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:09.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously like you have just a sort </v>

837
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 2>of implied capitalism or consumerism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern culture,</v>

838
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't gonna solve that.</v>

839
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 2>In fact it perpetuates that would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the interesting thing about time</v>

840
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:21.254
<v Speaker 2>is you're right,</v>

841
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.870
<v Speaker 3>people live inside their heads very much</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're encouraged to.</v>

842
00:43:25.871 --> 00:43:28.540
<v Speaker 3>They're encouraged to think that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the end point.</v>

843
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're heading towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

844
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.343
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually what's going on in those </v>

845
00:43:32.981 --> 00:43:37.480
<v Speaker 3>heads of things that people don't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to tell who all the sorts of things</v>

846
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.760
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning a stout.</v>

847
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Because actually if you are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right kind of individually,</v>

848
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.443
<v Speaker 3>don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mustn't have that and you see this </v>

849
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.910
<v Speaker 3>on social media at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>

850
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.073
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the politician who is going to get real </v>

851
00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.790
<v Speaker 3>power and take us somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

852
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 3>it's going to have to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are inside our cubs,</v>

853
00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.950
<v Speaker 3>which is loneliness and fear.</v>

854
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fright.</v>

855
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I woke up this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so lonely.</v>

856
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tell you something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

857
00:44:06.491 --> 00:44:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I was shit scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me.</v>

858
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a bloody pajamas on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foreign knew it was sad.</v>

859
00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm understand is coming down.</v>

860
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Bloody wanted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slippers fallen off.</v>

861
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 2>That scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stepped up.</v>

862
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Appalled that misread his bloody things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will only ever and ever.</v>

863
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.650
<v Speaker 2>And I'll say time you have to tiger on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the box.</v>

864
00:44:20.651 --> 00:44:22.390
<v Speaker 2>And frosties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was scared.</v>

865
00:44:22.391 --> 00:44:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Witless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

866
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:24.820
<v Speaker 2>It's too bloody late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>

867
00:44:24.821 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I said to you this little opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a sip of water.</v>

868
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.700
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what people obviously want is I say</v>

869
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.730
<v Speaker 2>the solution to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were two solutions as they,</v>

871
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to submit.</v>

872
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a subjugation of self self in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of,</v>

873
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:38.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course self is an amorphous </v>

874
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it all.</v>

875
00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.283
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about the kind of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this sort of relentless driven </v>

876
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 2>in a narrative that the two ways I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>found,</v>

877
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 2>because I've had to do this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>being serious for a while to snatch your</v>

878
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 2>mantle of pompous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pious back backpacks for 10 seconds,</v>

879
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.133
<v Speaker 2>I myself have had to battle quite sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I believe that the disease of </v>

880
00:44:58.231 --> 00:44:59.064
<v Speaker 2>addiction has it its core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of circuitous self centerdness </v>

881
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:03.894
<v Speaker 2>that can only be ended well first by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>removal of the initial substance that </v>

882
00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.000
<v Speaker 2>one identifies with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

883
00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 2>it was like crack and heroin at the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got clean.</v>

884
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.873
<v Speaker 2>Once those things gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize those drives are still </v>

885
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

886
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it become obsessed with food.</v>

887
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:17.904
<v Speaker 2>You become obsessed with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become obsessed with work and other </v>

888
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 2>people's opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the end,</v>

889
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you recognize that the only way to end </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

890
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:26.540
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

891
00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.373
<v Speaker 2>the torture of self obsession is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that have always been present in </v>

892
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 2>spiritual and religious doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>service,</v>

893
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 2>connection in it.</v>

894
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.500
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In his service,</v>

895
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:41.300
<v Speaker 2>we are free in whose service is perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and whose service is perfect for</v>

896
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 2>self up to something beyond yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So beautiful.</v>

897
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.514
<v Speaker 2>Even give yourself up is an idiom that </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that there is an output </v>

898
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 2>transcendent to trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other interesting area that,</v>

899
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 2>that in this is the modern ideas of love</v>
<v Speaker 2>are about satisfying yourself.</v>

900
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the old idea of love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you live,</v>

901
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:00.163
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you surrender yourself to someone else </v>

902
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's thrilling but frightening </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

903
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:05.514
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give yourself up and that kind of </v>

904
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 2>love has disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would come back.</v>

905
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Would you say your love for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like that.</v>

906
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.770
<v Speaker 2>You're a bit like a sort of a modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>archive.</v>

907
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:14.604
<v Speaker 2>Troubadour making wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that hypernormalisation was in </v>

908
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:18.954
<v Speaker 2>some level of dedicated to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have been called hyper Russell </v>

909
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 2>brand ization cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could actually remember,</v>

910
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're quite safe.</v>

911
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like a school teacher.</v>

912
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 2>So I agreed to come babysit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being pilloried confusing love.</v>

913
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Go to pitch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conflict with the muppet show,</v>

914
00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's already been out last week.</v>

915
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

916
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.303
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

917
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.383
<v Speaker 2>look what I want to get from you is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>now what you've just said is like </v>

918
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 2>someone is going to make headway in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political sphere and you know,</v>

919
00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and obviously like I assume on some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level that would be me.</v>

920
00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.793
<v Speaker 2>He's got someone that will know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>close that gap between the solipsistic </v>

921
00:47:03.831 --> 00:47:05.570
<v Speaker 2>circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If self obsession,</v>

922
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.870
<v Speaker 2>you can't this world out here that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>all forced to.</v>

923
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't put the genie back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle,</v>

924
00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The individualism is here to stay.</v>

925
00:47:13.191 --> 00:47:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

926
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.220
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

927
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.753
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a politician in the future who's </v>

928
00:47:18.891 --> 00:47:19.724
<v Speaker 2>going to change the world will do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is somehow allow people to still feel </v>

929
00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:23.864
<v Speaker 2>they're individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet at the same time will say if you </v>

930
00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 2>come together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can actually the world and something</v>

931
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.000
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

932
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it will be thrilling,</v>

933
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 3>but it will also be frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And take them into that world.</v>

934
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.773
<v Speaker 3>No one's managed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment what's happened is a lot of </v>

935
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:43.030
<v Speaker 3>the managerial systems have managed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make people feel they're individuals,</v>

936
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:46.000
<v Speaker 3>but manage them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've got to transcend that.</v>

937
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:46.883
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it may somehow come out to the </v>

938
00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:51.000
<v Speaker 3>internet in some way or another because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a mass communication tool.</v>

939
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:52.423
<v Speaker 3>It can create constituencies globally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not defined by geography states </v>

940
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 3>and old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the moment the technologist,</v>

941
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:57.994
<v Speaker 3>the engineering people who dominated </v>
<v Speaker 3>applying an engineering model to an </v>

942
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 3>engineering models are about feedback </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say they constantly read you in</v>

943
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 3>the past and feed more back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be like that,</v>

944
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:10.923
<v Speaker 3>but it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it needs is a content or a vision </v>

945
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:14.284
<v Speaker 3>of the future.</v>

946
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.403
<v Speaker 3>And it hasn't got one at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll work it out by the end of the </v>

947
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 3>podcast now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

948
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.700
<v Speaker 3>there's some of the more prosaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

949
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:20.643
<v Speaker 3>aspects of a contemporary life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think of old Trumpkins </v>

950
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.611
<v Speaker 3>Pumpkin then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

951
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:25.444
<v Speaker 3>Why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a very cynical theory about </v>

952
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump got one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

953
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.440
<v Speaker 3>as us politics became more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>deracinated and what does that mean?</v>

954
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:35.854
<v Speaker 3>Deracinated thinned out the resonated </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of less and less substantial </v>

955
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:48.820
<v Speaker 3>and less and less able to change things </v>
<v Speaker 3>or confidently able to change things and</v>

956
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 3>power shifted away to all sorts of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we were participating in.</v>

957
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Really what people like trump part is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've become,</v>

958
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 3>they're not really politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pantomime villains.</v>

959
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 3>They've turned politics into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vaudeville.</v>

960
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 3>And what will they do is they come on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage and we go,</v>

961
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 3>this is outrageous in big capitals.</v>

962
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.730
<v Speaker 3>This is absolutely terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We packed,</v>

963
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 3>we tap away on social media saying this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is really,</v>

964
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>

965
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.000
<v Speaker 3>And as I say in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

966
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:23.370
<v Speaker 3>a marketeer for online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every once angry people clickable and</v>

967
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 3>clicks are gold dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really what those cliques do is feed</v>

968
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 3>modern power and everything stays the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

969
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And do you mean feed modern power </v>
<v Speaker 3>editor?</v>

970
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.910
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

971
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.160
<v Speaker 3>if you click a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

972
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what social,</v>

973
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:39.993
<v Speaker 3>those who run social media benefit from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually keeping the whole thing </v>

974
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:46.420
<v Speaker 3>churning over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of power in that world.</v>

975
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:47.883
<v Speaker 3>If you have something like facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in its newsfeeds increasingly </v>

976
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.433
<v Speaker 3>gives you what it knows you like and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you you and what and what you hear </v>

977
00:49:58.121 --> 00:49:58.954
<v Speaker 3>is what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's incredibly powerful because </v>

978
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:01.984
<v Speaker 3>it's actually people's reality because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are shaping what they know and </v>

979
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:05.850
<v Speaker 3>you're shaping a Bible.</v>

980
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.360
<v Speaker 3>What you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

981
00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.510
<v Speaker 3>those who run social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say this is efficient.</v>

982
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not ideologists.</v>

983
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 3>They're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we must tell them this,</v>

984
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.460
<v Speaker 3>and in fact it's the algorithms that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

985
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Of course they've designed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithms,</v>

986
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:18.963
<v Speaker 3>but the algorithms function is to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you more of what it knows you like </v>

987
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 3>because that's efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at what that means.</v>

988
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.100
<v Speaker 3>That means that you only know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>others like you know,</v>

989
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.293
<v Speaker 3>and then there's another group over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there who know what they know that the </v>

990
00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 3>others in their group now and they never</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet.</v>

991
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.023
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fascinating quote of the day </v>

992
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:43.550
<v Speaker 3>after Brexit from a social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>activist who was a remainer.</v>

993
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to remain it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wanted to find out what the other</v>

994
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:49.430
<v Speaker 3>lot felt like who were the triumphant </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day,</v>

995
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 3>and he went onto facebook and he tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find through the custom feeds,</v>

996
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 3>people like that he couldn't do it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was actually shocked.</v>

997
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I won't read you the whole quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

998
00:50:59.131 --> 00:50:59.964
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a man realizing that there are two </v>

999
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 3>halves of the world now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so separated from each other.</v>

1000
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.253
<v Speaker 3>That one half can't actually actively go</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find out what the other half is </v>

1001
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:11.090
<v Speaker 3>feeling now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called power.</v>

1002
00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.493
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that in facebook there is </v>

1003
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 3>anyone saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the world we want.</v>

1004
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>They're saying this is efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

1005
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:18.464
<v Speaker 3>look what that efficiency is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a conservative world that holds </v>

1006
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:22.604
<v Speaker 3>things stable and implicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that means is that things aren't </v>

1007
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:26.264
<v Speaker 3>going to change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what that means is that those who </v>

1008
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:30.590
<v Speaker 3>are in remain making power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so power,</v>

1009
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>power cannot move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot move.</v>

1010
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Revolution is about reordering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reorganizing power,</v>

1011
00:51:37.741 --> 00:51:40.800
<v Speaker 2>distribution of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>redistribution of resources,</v>

1012
00:51:40.801 --> 00:51:43.440
<v Speaker 2>so a powerful forces for stacy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1013
00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.470
<v Speaker 2>a anodyne they may present themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

1014
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.810
<v Speaker 2>if not benign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then they are in fact the agents.</v>

1015
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.810
<v Speaker 3>All the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1016
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.733
<v Speaker 3>and then also in those chambers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone in those in your little network </v>

1017
00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.490
<v Speaker 3>or big network who comes along and says </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that the others don't like,</v>

1018
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.590
<v Speaker 3>gets up silently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ejected immediately.</v>

1019
00:52:02.591 --> 00:52:03.424
<v Speaker 3>The book that that journalist John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronson wrote about what it's like being </v>

1020
00:52:06.221 --> 00:52:07.054
<v Speaker 3>shamed on social media is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of anthropological example of what </v>

1021
00:52:10.481 --> 00:52:14.200
<v Speaker 3>happens to people within the network who</v>
<v Speaker 3>say the wrong thing.</v>

1022
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like being in a village in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>medieval times,</v>

1023
00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.580
<v Speaker 3>you're just ejected if you're the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1024
00:52:18.581 --> 00:52:21.280
<v Speaker 3>you're thrown out of the out of town </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the city limits,</v>

1025
00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.320
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everyone's.</v>

1026
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:24.303
<v Speaker 3>Everyone remains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remains thinking the same and that's </v>

1027
00:52:27.221 --> 00:52:29.320
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're complicit in it.</v>

1028
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:32.470
<v Speaker 3>And what's an everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows it.</v>

1029
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.233
<v Speaker 3>They know it.</v>

1030
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.540
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I'm very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>

1031
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:38.383
<v Speaker 2>you've said this several times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit in my standup of like </v>

1032
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 2>talking about the morning of the cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>election and he gives that speech and it</v>

1033
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:46.334
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that struck me on a personal </v>

1034
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.700
<v Speaker 2>level actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the speech that he gives,</v>

1035
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.633
<v Speaker 2>the speech that Theresa may gave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the speech that you often hear </v>

1036
00:52:52.521 --> 00:52:55.280
<v Speaker 2>politicians give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of utopian.</v>

1037
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.143
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build a Britain where </v>

1038
00:52:56.721 --> 00:52:57.554
<v Speaker 2>people are prepared to work and we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities they need with the </v>

1039
00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:01.670
<v Speaker 2>most vulnerable members of society are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked after we at what your religion or</v>

1040
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 2>your race is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be taken care of.</v>

1041
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:04.780
<v Speaker 2>We'll be able to case you've Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone can participate.</v>

1042
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Speaker 2>You think fucking know if that what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying,</v>

1043
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>then it was the reality that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1044
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 2>but I know that what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and you know that it's bullshit</v>

1045
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:16.220
<v Speaker 2>and you know that we know it's bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet it's perpetuated.</v>

1046
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.053
<v Speaker 2>Now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the distillation of </v>

1047
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>hypernormalisation is the disjunct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this other idea of there being two,</v>

1048
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 2>a tandem narratives concurrently running</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes place,</v>

1049
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:28.164
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to consult the external </v>

1050
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 2>world to get ratification of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has because it happens internally</v>

1051
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 2>as well on individual levels of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual's consciousness.</v>

1052
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:37.614
<v Speaker 2>That one census,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the part of the part of me that </v>

1053
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 2>is married to the fulfillment of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulation.</v>

1054
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:44.740
<v Speaker 2>There's the part of me that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1055
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.070
<v Speaker 2>that will just happily use this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>as.</v>

1056
00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:47.701
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1057
00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Then what is another way that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>assert myself in the public conversation</v>

1058
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:54.390
<v Speaker 2>and in public life powerfully?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I get?</v>

1059
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.233
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've tried sort of vanilla fame of </v>

1060
00:53:58.141 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 2>being sort of Hollywood actor and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this sort of like this activism,</v>

1061
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 2>feynman that weren't quite fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the next version?</v>

1062
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Proper religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual devotion.</v>

1063
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Now that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will do it.</v>

1064
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.471
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:13.050
<v Speaker 2>so these things don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way the stimuli is the same.</v>

1066
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:13.884
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the object is shifting in Hollywood </v>

1067
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:15.541
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1068
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

1069
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 2>The object is shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the drive remains the same.</v>

1070
00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.613
<v Speaker 2>Now it's only through like know was only</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a kind of a sense of actual </v>

1071
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 2>detachment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relinquishing and service,</v>

1072
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 2>but I can alter the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the modem,</v>

1073
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:27.324
<v Speaker 2>I can know I can alter the engine burst </v>
<v Speaker 2>or if there is such a thing as an </v>

1074
00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 2>essential self beyond the biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>drives,</v>

1075
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.453
<v Speaker 2>beyond the biographical recollections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is some self is consciousness </v>

1076
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.143
<v Speaker 2>is something and not nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not some inadvertent byproduct of the </v>

1077
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:43.853
<v Speaker 2>working of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain rather then then there is </v>

1078
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 2>surely some value in this info in </v>
<v Speaker 2>attaching to.</v>

1079
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.580
<v Speaker 2>This is quite simple and religious idea.</v>

1080
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I do think that the one thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come back onto the table,</v>

1081
00:54:56.711 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 3>his religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think the real weakness of the</v>

1082
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:01.054
<v Speaker 3>modern systems of managing us as </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals is that it cannot deal with </v>

1083
00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:08.380
<v Speaker 3>our own mortality because the great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm more,</v>

1084
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.660
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>PROZAC and functional.</v>

1085
00:55:10.661 --> 00:55:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Then you have Arabic religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think it's.</v>

1086
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:18.110
<v Speaker 3>It's main function in society has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>to give people constellation in the face</v>

1087
00:55:18.671 --> 00:55:22.120
<v Speaker 3>of their own death that the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when they die,</v>

1088
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.420
<v Speaker 3>something will go on and they will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of something that's going on.</v>

1089
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:30.470
<v Speaker 3>It's really powerful and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary and that's the in the modern,</v>

1090
00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:31.630
<v Speaker 3>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient,</v>

1091
00:55:31.631 --> 00:55:32.464
<v Speaker 3>utilitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technocratic world of managing the </v>

1092
00:55:34.481 --> 00:55:37.990
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cannot give you any constellation and</v>

1093
00:55:37.991 --> 00:55:38.824
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of the pessimism that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>find on the left is from that they're </v>

1094
00:55:43.271 --> 00:55:44.104
<v Speaker 3>actually projecting onto the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're saying there's not really as </v>

1095
00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:50.470
<v Speaker 3>good day everybody's going to die and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes this sort of terrible,</v>

1096
00:55:50.471 --> 00:55:51.304
<v Speaker 3>terrible fear of death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which then colors everything which then </v>

1097
00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 3>stops them being optimistic about </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the world.</v>

1098
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.633
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you said before about fear and </v>

1099
00:55:59.381 --> 00:56:00.250
<v Speaker 2>loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1100
00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are sort of a.</v>

1101
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.353
<v Speaker 2>that's an emotional conversation that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're kind of a dry creaking </v>

1102
00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:10.600
<v Speaker 2>arguments of socialism and unable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have now.</v>

1103
00:56:10.601 --> 00:56:11.434
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about this also often remember </v>

1104
00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 2>that socialism came out of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in this country.</v>

1105
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that it was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly departed from it because,</v>

1106
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:20.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for understandable reasons around dogma </v>

1107
00:56:21.431 --> 00:56:22.241
<v Speaker 2>and because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:56:22.241 --> 00:56:26.420
<v Speaker 2>sort of necessity or lifestyle for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions of a century or so ago meant</v>

1109
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.841
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:27.674
<v Speaker 2>that that kind of state church and state</v>
<v Speaker 2>power had to be dressed and harmonized </v>

1111
00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 2>and somewhat knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

1112
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 2>what that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is required is a sort of a,</v>

1113
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:39.274
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to once again distill and </v>

1114
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:42.034
<v Speaker 2>recognize what the function of religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is to help us deal with the </v>

1115
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:47.590
<v Speaker 2>experience of being a human being that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1116
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:48.424
<v Speaker 2>that politics is no longer able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no longer aspires to do and which </v>

1117
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 2>consumers in artfully done for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous 50 years.</v>

1118
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to be filtering at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1119
00:56:57.851 --> 00:56:58.684
<v Speaker 2>And now you're saying that these sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we're talking about kind of a </v>

1120
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:01.504
<v Speaker 2>niche market really aren't because most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world don't sit around on </v>

1121
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:06.330
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they not in like Africa or uh,</v>

1122
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Latin America?</v>

1123
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1124
00:57:08.531 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like so,</v>

1125
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.013
<v Speaker 2>so like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're discussing is a is a </v>

1126
00:57:12.681 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 2>particular phenomena to our kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>

1127
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:16.443
<v Speaker 2>but it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I obviously agree with you and in </v>

1128
00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:20.374
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I was somewhat directly </v>

1129
00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:24.420
<v Speaker 2>involved in the media and political </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1130
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I felt was this isn't actually all.</v>

1131
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.313
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I felt like this isn't the </v>

1132
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:34.150
<v Speaker 2>conversation I want to after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the new shy and Trivia.</v>

1133
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in something that is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct and very real among and </v>

1134
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:38.900
<v Speaker 2>understand a person like what?</v>

1135
00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.890
<v Speaker 2>What can you sort of think that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>saints get?</v>

1136
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Not the band science and although they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were bloody good.</v>

1137
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved those sisters reached the point </v>

1138
00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 2>of altruism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Service.</v>

1139
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Surrender becomes sort of kind of simple</v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost indistinguishable from mental</v>

1140
00:57:57.671 --> 00:57:58.504
<v Speaker 2>illness in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cases I'm talking particularly </v>

1141
00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 2>if Francis of Assisi who wouldn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>around your calf,</v>

1142
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing goats in,</v>

1143
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 2>ranting and raving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the pan pipes on the stairwells,</v>

1144
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.503
<v Speaker 2>meddling with your cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting them all in jumpers and telling </v>

1145
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:13.620
<v Speaker 2>you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the spirit of Jesus in them.</v>

1146
00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Because let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he would do.</v>

1147
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1148
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 2>so this hypernormalization I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's doing is,</v>

1149
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:22.100
<v Speaker 2>is we're living in a spectacle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

1150
00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too,</v>

1151
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:25.950
<v Speaker 2>now that the words come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty similar to some of that deep</v>

1152
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 2>boys idea though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of late,</v>

1153
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late 60 situation is in French situation</v>

1154
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:30.680
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>

1155
00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a minute.</v>

1156
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.333
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody hell is this.</v>

1157
00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you go,</v>

1158
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you?</v>

1159
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 2>What is my role in the world that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no access to what he's real,</v>

1160
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.480
<v Speaker 2>but we are living in an impersonation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

1161
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I've never really got along with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that debord stuff.</v>

1162
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 2>It's all men in black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black punk music.</v>

1163
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:48.844
<v Speaker 2>Talk about that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more mundane than that is </v>

1164
00:58:52.871 --> 00:58:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every age creates its own reality.</v>

1165
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:56.943
<v Speaker 2>That's what power does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the functional Paris to tell you </v>

1166
00:58:58.511 --> 00:59:00.870
<v Speaker 2>a story about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our story wins.</v>

1167
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what is reality?</v>

1168
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:05.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just a jumble of masses of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gas,</v>

1169
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>real power is taking the reality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaping it.</v>

1170
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.713
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're talking about is </v>

1171
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:17.180
<v Speaker 2>also is that we are becoming a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>distrustful of the stories those empower</v>

1172
00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 2>tell us and it's all feeling a bit Janky</v>
<v Speaker 2>and falling apart and what we're waiting</v>

1173
00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

1174
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.993
<v Speaker 3>is another story that comes in on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I find it a bit odd is that </v>

1175
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:26.114
<v Speaker 3>actually rather than celebrating this </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment of sort of transitioned from one </v>

1176
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:29.564
<v Speaker 3>big story to another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're feeling so frightened rather than </v>

1177
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 3>actually celebrating it as a moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can shape anything the way you</v>

1178
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:35.084
<v Speaker 3>wanted it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's lurking around is not </v>

1179
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:38.804
<v Speaker 3>just religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two things sitting around </v>

1180
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:41.590
<v Speaker 3>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When is religion,</v>

1181
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.443
<v Speaker 3>the other science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that no one ever talks about </v>

1182
00:59:43.911 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 3>the memory because scientists has got </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in many ways in dogma,</v>

1183
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:48.973
<v Speaker 3>in sort of weird dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also because it's all about serving </v>

1184
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:53.750
<v Speaker 3>the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These days,</v>

1185
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:54.883
<v Speaker 3>scientists spend their time getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>grants by doing research that tells us </v>

1186
00:59:56.901 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 3>that if you eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll die.</v>

1187
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Or if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it have a bad effect on your health.</v>

1188
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.420
<v Speaker 3>And then next year I'm telling you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite about that.</v>

1189
01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Here's another one that is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reductive.</v>

1190
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.990
<v Speaker 3>It's been reduced to at our </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginations,</v>

1191
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.033
<v Speaker 3>whereas somewhat science used to do was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell us extraordinary things about the </v>

1192
01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 3>world that hidden things that it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>reveal,</v>

1193
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 3>and this is sort of Austin was waiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to be rediscovered and I have this</v>

1194
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:24.731
<v Speaker 3>instinct that what might happen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer to the sort of rather strange,</v>

1195
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:25.664
<v Speaker 3>utilitarian stuckness of our time is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that someone will find a way of fusing </v>

1196
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:32.710
<v Speaker 3>scientific ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious ideas to produce a certain,</v>

1197
01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.173
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a vision of an extraordinary world that </v>

1198
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 3>somehow has a logical power to it and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>

1199
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.580
<v Speaker 3>The science and religion will fuse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it will.</v>

1200
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 3>What it will offer is a way of us still </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling that we're individuals,</v>

1201
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 3>but there's another word we can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards.</v>

1202
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.913
<v Speaker 3>What do you think would be the role of </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional religions like Islam and in </v>

1203
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 3>in this changing world?</v>

1204
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Islam is interesting because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1205
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.493
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it combines an idea of individualism </v>

1206
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:08.520
<v Speaker 3>with the sense of community and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful that.</v>

1207
01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1208
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:11.234
<v Speaker 3>in the western world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to discuss his lab </v>

1209
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 3>at the moment without getting a wave of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's the word,</v>

1210
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.660
<v Speaker 3>fear and disapproval because it's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>so demonized.</v>

1211
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to praise Islam or,</v>

1212
01:01:24.331 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or be rude about it,</v>

1213
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:26.743
<v Speaker 3>but it is fascinating religion to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at and I think I gave you a book once </v>

1214
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:31.424
<v Speaker 3>which was the history of the world told </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Islamic perspective and when </v>

1215
01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:35.834
<v Speaker 3>you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just makes you look at the world </v>

1216
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we do these days.</v>

1217
01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Destiny disrupted.</v>

1218
01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:41.714
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic book because it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull back and look at the world </v>

1219
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 3>differently and we just don't do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>

1220
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.833
<v Speaker 3>I suppose people aren't really willing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to embrace that kind of mentality or </v>

1221
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 3>change unless there is some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperation typically.</v>

1222
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And traditionally people don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1223
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 3>say like Latin revolutions in sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit off this mic.</v>

1224
01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:03.434
<v Speaker 3>People are concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my voice isn't as deep and booming </v>

1225
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 3>dominant as he me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like that,</v>

1226
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.013
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typically revolutions happen when the </v>

1227
01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:16.010
<v Speaker 3>conditions are correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people are galvanized.</v>

1228
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Norml is an element of desperation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but done.</v>

1229
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>There's always someone who comes along </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystallizes it.</v>

1230
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:20.874
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been fascinated by the </v>

1231
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:23.600
<v Speaker 3>Iranian revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many came along.</v>

1232
01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean he and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he managed to assemble three or four</v>

1233
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 3>different groups in society and somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave them a common identity.</v>

1234
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 3>He didn't just killed off about two of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other groups.</v>

1235
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.760
<v Speaker 3>He's going really well and he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1236
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 3>the few execution is towards the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of their evolution.</v>

1237
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 3>A master's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But got up until then.</v>

1238
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:43.651
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1239
01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:44.484
<v Speaker 3>what Romania did is he realized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole massive group of </v>

1240
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:47.994
<v Speaker 3>people who'd moved into the cities over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last 10 years in the 19 seventies </v>

1241
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:55.910
<v Speaker 3>who were really pissed off and felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely alone.</v>

1242
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.653
<v Speaker 3>And he saw that group and he also saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a group of middle class </v>

1243
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.823
<v Speaker 3>left wing activists and he put the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>together because what he did with this </v>

1244
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 3>lamb is he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1245
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 3>we can put it to the size it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pushed aside Islam,</v>

1246
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.880
<v Speaker 3>especially sheer Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had always seen itself as quiet.</v>

1247
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:14.743
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't going to take an active role </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world and that was its tradition </v>

1248
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 3>and he did it brilliantly and he then </v>
<v Speaker 3>took power and you got rid of the middle</v>

1249
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:25.480
<v Speaker 3>class activist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just shot them around here.</v>

1250
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.573
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it revolutions are brutal and </v>

1251
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:32.340
<v Speaker 3>frightening and this is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one has to go back to.</v>

1252
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.490
<v Speaker 3>If you want change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to change the world,</v>

1253
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.533
<v Speaker 3>you have to tackle power and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>tackle it's quite rough and things will </v>

1254
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:42.594
<v Speaker 3>get quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the word iffy and I think the </v>

1255
01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:47.514
<v Speaker 3>middle class is might find it a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult and I remember once having at </v>

1256
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 3>a thing with you when we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

1257
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 3>just turning to the audience and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually really?</v>

1258
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.390
<v Speaker 3>You talk about revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about change.</v>

1259
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.403
<v Speaker 3>Do you really wanted it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will change the world massively for you </v>

1260
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 3>or do you just want the banks to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit nicer?</v>

1261
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1262
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 3>and there was complete silence because </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I do think at the moment in the</v>

1263
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 3>West people genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nice,</v>

1264
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:16.800
<v Speaker 3>they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really want change,</v>

1265
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:17.993
<v Speaker 3>but they want change that isn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to disrupt the world and I'm not </v>

1266
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:21.354
<v Speaker 3>sure that's really possible if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to give a voice and a power </v>

1267
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.183
<v Speaker 3>and a sense of confidence to all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people outside the city who are feeling </v>

1268
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 3>lonely and uncertain and living </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>

1269
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:34.763
<v Speaker 3>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uncertain lives have no sense of their </v>

1270
01:04:36.241 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>own confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Confident Future.</v>

1271
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.083
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to change things </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite substantially and you're going to </v>

1272
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:43.710
<v Speaker 3>have to take on really vested interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be quite frightening.</v>

1273
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 3>You got to be willing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is it.</v>

1274
01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I think that like the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>a priest and a prophet,</v>

1275
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.910
<v Speaker 3>someone explained to me was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1276
01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 3>the willingness to live it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the willingness.</v>

1277
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:54.144
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1278
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.193
<v Speaker 3>I'll sacrifice everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go back to the civil rights </v>

1279
01:04:57.271 --> 01:05:01.320
<v Speaker 3>movement in the 19 fifties and America </v>
<v Speaker 3>white middle class activists went to the</v>

1280
01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:02.154
<v Speaker 3>south and they gave up their lives for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years to do something that they thought </v>

1281
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>was morally right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as someone wrote the other day,</v>

1282
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.163
<v Speaker 3>you cannot imagine that happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd want to be telling everyone that </v>

1283
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:14.260
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1284
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's how you get validated </v>

1285
01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 3>these days as an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want</v>

1286
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.980
<v Speaker 2>people to know that you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

1287
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Most of the heroes of the civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

1288
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>especially with remained anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1289
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>

1290
01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:31.340
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about is a I vialed </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual idea because that is about,</v>

1291
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:32.343
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is because it's about the </v>

1292
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>transcendence of your individualism that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1293
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:35.763
<v Speaker 2>That you're not going to receive </v>
<v Speaker 2>validation from anyone in here who </v>

1294
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also politics.</v>

1295
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Politics is about giving yourself up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1296
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.400
<v Speaker 2>an idea beyond yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's religion and it's its,</v>

1297
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>its dominant idea about how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you deal with a dynamic world.</v>

1298
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>At the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pretend the load is stable,</v>

1299
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't.</v>

1300
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact it isn't,</v>

1301
01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that I had a wicked </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote from derailed our show and it sort</v>

1302
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 2>of rings incredibly true given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actuality,</v>

1303
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:07.990
<v Speaker 2>the cosmic actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just our time,</v>

1304
01:06:07.991 --> 01:06:09.610
<v Speaker 2>but of all time said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1305
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 2>of someone brought up society and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1306
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 2>society what?</v>

1307
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 2>The society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a clearing in the forest.</v>

1308
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:18.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this will be reclaimed by nature.</v>

1309
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:22.780
<v Speaker 2>We are in infinite space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your point about order and stability,</v>

1310
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.673
<v Speaker 2>these things are always temporal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of ongoing stability in </v>

1311
01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:33.061
<v Speaker 2>limitless chaos when the actual code we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being cradled by absolute chaos is,</v>

1312
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 2>it's an anathema and it's unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is unsustainable.</v>

1313
01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It can't continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will review.</v>

1314
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't mean you can't try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve good things.</v>

1315
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two now.</v>

1316
01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that there are two types</v>
<v Speaker 2>of political ideas have changed.</v>

1317
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.310
<v Speaker 2>One is that you can actually seize </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and Tony or way,</v>

1318
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.980
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of what Napoleon has tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1319
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.900
<v Speaker 2>His great example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is,</v>

1320
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1321
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:59.063
<v Speaker 2>you understand that the world is chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see a moment where you can use </v>

1322
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:06.070
<v Speaker 2>the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally achieve what you want to do.</v>

1323
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other way of changing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1324
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.340
<v Speaker 2>that it's about opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to do that.</v>

1325
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:13.174
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a picture in your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>or what you are trying to get towards </v>

1326
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.350
<v Speaker 2>what you think is good and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust as the chaos around you changes.</v>

1327
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1328
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do know that we think this is it.</v>

1329
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.533
<v Speaker 2>These ideologies are all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be sort of pretty reactive in </v>

1330
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:29.290
<v Speaker 2>a sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>

1331
01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.300
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you fashion them?</v>

1332
01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Even if you talk about one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a radical,</v>

1333
01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:39.130
<v Speaker 2>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of a vivid narratives to emerge</v>

1334
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:43.240
<v Speaker 2>like knit sort of 20th century fascism </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

1335
01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>that was a response to economic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>political conditions.</v>

1336
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>You can't just out of nowhere go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this thing.</v>

1337
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:49.923
<v Speaker 2>The land is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a folk and that's where it's </v>

1338
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:52.804
<v Speaker 2>frightening change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a response to chaos in </v>

1339
01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.140
<v Speaker 2>the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1340
01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1341
01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 2>and remember that they were socialists </v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with finances.</v>

1342
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:01.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national socialists and they had seen </v>

1343
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:03.964
<v Speaker 2>the chaos at the market in America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe and they reacted against it </v>

1344
01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1345
01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:12.250
<v Speaker 2>we are going to organize this and we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go towards this.</v>

1346
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>And it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1347
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.490
<v Speaker 2>the other argument is that all rhetoric </v>
<v Speaker 2>about revolution</v>

1348
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.323
<v Speaker 3>at the moment is just rhetoric because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience of our generation of our </v>

1349
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:24.800
<v Speaker 3>time is a century of revolutions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>went badly wrong.</v>

1350
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the last thing we want is one or </v>

1351
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.513
<v Speaker 3>more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then actually what we were creating </v>

1352
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 3>in reaction is a very conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

1353
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 3>a counterrevolutionary moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're living through.</v>

1354
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.733
<v Speaker 3>And it may go on for quite a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all arguments about revolutionary </v>

1355
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 3>change are just like quarterly behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do it,</v>

1356
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.230
<v Speaker 3>but we don't really expect it's ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen.</v>

1357
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:48.860
<v Speaker 3>This is a cynical view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's how history works.</v>

1358
01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:49.694
<v Speaker 3>You go through a period of intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution which does change the world </v>

1359
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.003
<v Speaker 3>and then you have a counter revolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>which which is actually born out of the </v>

1360
01:08:58.310 --> 01:08:59.143
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1361
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 3>the social classes that came out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those revolutions that failed,</v>

1362
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:04.124
<v Speaker 3>but it led to a new class breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>through and now they want everything to </v>

1363
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:08.114
<v Speaker 3>be stapled and that the argument about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what people like Mrs Thatcher and </v>

1364
01:09:11.271 --> 01:09:12.104
<v Speaker 3>President Reagan we're about is that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new lower middle class which we're </v>

1365
01:09:16.071 --> 01:09:21.071
<v Speaker 3>confident rose up in the 19 seventies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wanted its place in society and they</v>

1366
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:22.590
<v Speaker 3>let me read.</v>

1367
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Thatcher and Reagan left that class </v>
<v Speaker 3>through economically new labor,</v>

1368
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:27.794
<v Speaker 3>let it through culturally and socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gave it confidence and now he wants </v>

1369
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:31.844
<v Speaker 3>everything to stop and be stable and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems of management that we have got </v>

1370
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:37.334
<v Speaker 3>him placed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about keeping everything </v>

1371
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:41.160
<v Speaker 3>stable are a reflection of that class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that path,</v>

1372
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.033
<v Speaker 3>new classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>desire for stability and we may be in </v>

1373
01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 3>this for the longterm longterm,</v>

1374
01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.010
<v Speaker 2>but of course again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1375
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 2>these are quite isolated interests like </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a global level,</v>

1376
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 2>aren't they adam?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1377
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 2>or do you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I'm.</v>

1378
01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.950
<v Speaker 2>When you take something that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately there has to be a resource,</v>

1379
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.813
<v Speaker 2>like any management of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resource has to be sort of the </v>

1380
01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:05.500
<v Speaker 2>feelings of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.910
<v Speaker 2>and of course people can be manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directed,</v>

1382
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:08.744
<v Speaker 2>encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of things that can </v>

1383
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.200
<v Speaker 2>happen to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1384
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>but we'll look at the way we consume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the things we do,</v>

1385
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 2>the places we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were.</v>

1386
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:14.384
<v Speaker 2>Obviously people's desires can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>management related and moved around the </v>

1387
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:18.074
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like when you're talking about when </v>

1388
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1389
01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 2>when he becomes quite defined and </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific is it just did.</v>

1390
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:24.710
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1391
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:25.544
<v Speaker 2>like sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a generation of people going through </v>

1392
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.470
<v Speaker 2>batteries and then sort of is in or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we would call it.</v>

1393
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And now that makes sense to me as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

1394
01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>It makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1395
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like to wield such </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible influence.</v>

1396
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:40.670
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a very small </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>

1397
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.533
<v Speaker 2>aren't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about sort of a class of </v>

1398
01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:43.310
<v Speaker 2>people in Western Europe.</v>

1399
01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.610
<v Speaker 3>You're living in America where we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in our bubble,</v>

1400
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 3>in history and in geography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are all sorts of other,</v>

1401
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.203
<v Speaker 3>I mean the sad thing about our time is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are all sorts of other things </v>

1402
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:52.624
<v Speaker 3>happening outside our bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because we're so scared of change </v>

1403
01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.730
<v Speaker 3>and we're scared of looking outside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're scared of the future,</v>

1404
01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.310
<v Speaker 3>we don't really see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think the thing about our time,</v>

1405
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.160
<v Speaker 3>which is sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're a bit like,</v>

1406
01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.053
<v Speaker 3>you know when things go wrong in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>airplane or you're encouraged to adopt </v>

1407
01:11:06.521 --> 01:11:09.520
<v Speaker 3>what they call the brace position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you hunker down,</v>

1408
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:10.503
<v Speaker 3>you're too frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jakarta window because you can see the </v>

1409
01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 3>wind going up and down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where we are at the moment.</v>

1410
01:11:14.551 --> 01:11:15.384
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're refusing to look outside and see </v>

1411
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:18.264
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do all my plain Jane is embrace </v>

1412
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 3>position since I've got on before they </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring the food.</v>

1413
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:23.183
<v Speaker 3>Braise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>braise,</v>

<v Speaker 2>manage and keep things stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Adam.</v>

<v Speaker 2>from the underneath,</v>

1421
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.410
<v Speaker 2>from the upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the other world,</v>

1422
01:11:45.411 --> 01:11:47.570
<v Speaker 2>from the Nether region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the other place,</v>

1423
01:11:47.571 --> 01:11:48.404
<v Speaker 2>from the shadow lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look down at your smartphone so </v>

1424
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.430
<v Speaker 2>vehemently and aggressively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough,</v>

1425
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.610
<v Speaker 2>having met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't like Lord Palmerston.</v>

1426
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you know much about no pack course?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are these appropriate?</v>

1427
01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.130
<v Speaker 2>A stove pipe pattern?</v>

1428
01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

1429
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:11.163
<v Speaker 2>Lord Palmerston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a biography by Russell brand based on </v>

1430
01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:18.280
<v Speaker 2>noise and one fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact bearing his name.</v>

1431
01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which part he was in liberals,</v>

1432
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.370
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember the names of Adam.</v>

1433
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for coming in in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pleasure.</v>

1434
01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:28.900
<v Speaker 2>You know I love you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that.</v>

1435
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I wonder where you fit into all this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your emotional life.</v>

1436
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:38.990
<v Speaker 2>You are happier this some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesting itself.</v>

1437
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's just pure narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if it is,</v>

1438
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:45.730
<v Speaker 2>it's very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too Real.</v>

1439
01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what's happening for you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1440
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.933
<v Speaker 3>I was being serious that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a sort of the persona you have </v>

1441
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 3>created as a comedian is the arch </v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic or age you.</v>

1442
01:12:57.991 --> 01:12:58.824
<v Speaker 3>You play on that and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are self conscious about it and </v>

1443
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.333
<v Speaker 3>in that sense you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the word and example of modern </v>

1444
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 3>social realism because everyone lives in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their heads these days.</v>

1445
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just do.</v>

1446
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:10.703
<v Speaker 3>They don't live outside and most modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>novels or or the internal monologue </v>

1447
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.890
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an exponent's your you,</v>

1448
01:13:17.891 --> 01:13:18.724
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1449
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:22.140
<v Speaker 3>you demonstrate that in three </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensional space.</v>

1450
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very good at doing the,</v>

1451
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.033
<v Speaker 3>bringing out the consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way people live in their heads all </v>

1452
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:32.280
<v Speaker 3>the time and you express it in a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you would call comedic way.</v>

1453
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is objective.</v>

1454
01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is a discipline.</v>

1455
01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:40.230
<v Speaker 3>It's an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to call it what you would</v>

1456
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 3>call and what you're keeping bumping up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against is what lies beyond that.</v>

1457
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is it religion or is that it?</v>

1458
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is</v>

1459
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.093
<v Speaker 2>these religion in the sense of like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in spite of being on a course of </v>

1460
01:13:56.161 --> 01:13:57.690
<v Speaker 2>religion and global politics where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me,</v>

1461
01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:58.563
<v Speaker 2>this is not the definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that religion is where we </v>

1462
01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 2>interface with the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

1463
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:03.624
<v Speaker 2>this is where the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said this to you on the phone </v>

1464
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 2>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1465
01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 2>ultimately our capacity to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>information will run out.</v>

1466
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>We're there is a limit to our</v>

1467
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.430
<v Speaker 3>ability to understand information that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the information will not run out.</v>

1468
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.653
<v Speaker 3>So at some point faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that what religion is it a </v>

1469
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:20.644
<v Speaker 3>sense about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the acknowledgement of </v>

1470
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:23.343
<v Speaker 3>everything we don't know and a story </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is based on face trying to make </v>

1471
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:29.590
<v Speaker 3>sense of what we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1472
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought that's what religion</v>
<v Speaker 3>was about.</v>

1473
01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 3>Well apparently plus constellation in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the face of not knowing everything will.</v>

1474
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 3>It'd be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like.</v>

1475
01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:37.573
<v Speaker 3>So I think humility might be really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for our society in the future and maybe </v>

1476
01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 3>we've reached the limits of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>individualism,</v>

1477
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:44.763
<v Speaker 3>but maybe we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is it because we think of </v>
