00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Given that your person who tells stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that you do,</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.863
<v Speaker 1>it's not like people just liked guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this idea so irresistible to </v>

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>American people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>like you see sort of like a speech after</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandy hook or wherever.</v>

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.633
<v Speaker 1>And is that all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the day now where we don't have </v>

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>guns anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like,</v>

8
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

9
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Why is this so powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to their,</v>

10
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.853
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an excellent question and I </v>

11
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:35.260
<v Speaker 2>guess one of the best ways to explain it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

12
00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.094
<v Speaker 2>and you touched on it there in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping into some core things about how </v>

13
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:40.744
<v Speaker 2>America feels about itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got nothing to do with guns but </v>

14
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 2>work quite well with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

15
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I used to go to the NRA,</v>

16
00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I went to a couple of NRA convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the National Rifle Association,</v>

17
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:57.031
<v Speaker 2>which is the gun lobby and the vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like weird,</v>

18
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of,</v>

19
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of white guys,</v>

20
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographic,</v>

21
00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 2>probably more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they're trying to push guns in,</v>

22
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.573
<v Speaker 2>in more in women's direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so lots of pink guns and nice things </v>

23
00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 2>that you can carry your gun in and kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways to look pretty with your guns,</v>

24
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

25
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of white guys and it almost kind of</v>

26
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>almost sexual relationship to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these weapons,</v>

27
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:28.984
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of the stroking them and </v>

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.513
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

30
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

31
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 2>pouring them basically.</v>

32
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 2>And I would really play up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>englishness in these things.</v>

33
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all because it,</v>

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps and secondly because it </v>

35
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:47.254
<v Speaker 2>mitigates the blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you throw me now and I'm like </v>

36
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Downton Abbey coming out of your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>from Steven and I've got another puff </v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy.</v>

38
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at Puff Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hearing Downton Abbey.</v>

39
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 2>If I could explain stevenage too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that would sort everything out.</v>

40
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 2>So every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most stevenage is a shitshow.</v>

41
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.703
<v Speaker 2>You can continue with your prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy in Essex to stevenage and I that </v>

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 2>understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or rather I don't understand this,</v>

43
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm explaining it to me and to a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were off to the races.</v>

44
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you married?</v>

45
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.473
<v Speaker 2>Do you have children yet imagined </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone broke into your house and they </v>

46
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:34.714
<v Speaker 2>wanted to rape your wife and kill your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and take everything that you </v>

47
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 2>worked for what you're going to do.</v>

48
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.193
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

49
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiver sticker them.</v>

50
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 2>You're going to call the cops and wait </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the cops to come,</v>

51
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 2>or you're going to defend your family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and defend what you meant.</v>

52
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And so it speaks to your kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>

53
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Homestead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small government individualism,</v>

54
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 2>a notion of kind of might being right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defendable shows.</v>

55
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Now the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

56
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>there are several kinds of facts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradict that.</v>

57
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Especially most people who were shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead killed themselves.</v>

58
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.443
<v Speaker 2>Second day after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to be shot dead </v>

59
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>by someone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone you've done so well I should say</v>

60
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you married?</v>

61
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

62
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 2>watch out for your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

64
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survey evoke these,</v>

65
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.690
<v Speaker 2>a very primal yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>things in the culture and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted with that,</v>

67
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 2>if you start talking about background </v>
<v Speaker 2>checks and um,</v>

68
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banning semiautomatic weapons and stuff </v>

69
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:50.664
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a match for the basic </v>

70
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>ideas of American individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small government masculinity and so on.</v>

71
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about tinkering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think so they,</v>

72
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.683
<v Speaker 2>they have a powerful narrative that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tap into and the gun control people </v>

73
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.653
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
