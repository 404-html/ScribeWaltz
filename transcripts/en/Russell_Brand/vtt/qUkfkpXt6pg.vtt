16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm maybe 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>How did you know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>had a problem with substances and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you needed to change?</v>

19
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It was all kind of.</v>

20
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>My teens were kind of explosive and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing comedy really young.</v>

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I think you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

22
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as young as you like.</v>

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>11 warning has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.943
<v Speaker 1>when I was 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian like got me up on stage and </v>

25
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>made me be his ventriloquist dummy so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't count that.</v>

26
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.174
<v Speaker 1>But when I was stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though seeing that pioneering </v>

27
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.371
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

29
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the front row,</v>

30
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.333
<v Speaker 1>I always loved comedy and then he got me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and he said I'll squeeze the back of </v>

31
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>your neck and you open your mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make you say stuff.</v>

32
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.123
<v Speaker 1>But he thought I was a little boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was in like a three piece </v>

33
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's making me say like filthy </v>

34
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Anyway,</v>

35
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>it was fun and got lots of laughs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then got obsessed with it.</v>

36
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

37
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.783
<v Speaker 1>So then in my teens I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and I got kicked out of my house </v>

38
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>and ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents were,</v>

39
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>well they read my diaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I'd,</v>

40
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean rookie mistake had been keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>these like meticulous diaries and they </v>

41
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>found out all this stuff I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

42
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess their reaction was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of anger and they were doing tough</v>

43
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they said he can't live here anymore.</v>

44
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I think that was a 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

45
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>That's in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

47
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's the age when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved out when I was 16 or so.</v>

48
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Kind of in pursuit of addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>What made me leave except the addiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

50
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.743
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you're a fascinating </v>

51
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:23.941
<v Speaker 1>guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

52
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.774
<v Speaker 1>your within the field of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you highly respected and you're doing </v>

53
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:28.644
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I suppose topically you're </v>

54
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff that's kind of defining of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our time.</v>

55
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>You'll show before your last ones about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender and gender identity.</v>

56
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.634
<v Speaker 1>You most recent shows about addiction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense like in anglophone and can </v>

57
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>possibly non anglophone countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are determining ideas like whereas</v>

58
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>people look to understand evolving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolving forms of categorization.</v>

59
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>We look for different ways to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

60
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.274
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk us through whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that question is clever that I've just </v>

61
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>or observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really a question,</v>

62
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

63
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>It's very clever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very flattering.</v>

64
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

65
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:06.544
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear the word spectrum a lot </v>

66
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well with addiction anyway,</v>

67
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:14.254
<v Speaker 2>I think if you've had a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and then you've acknowledged I'm </v>

68
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.064
<v Speaker 2>an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be quite isolating and you feel </v>

69
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.434
<v Speaker 2>like you're part of this kind of small </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsection of the world who just can't </v>

70
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 2>handle their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's been,</v>

71
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a really recent thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me just reading about it and learning </v>

72
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.851
<v Speaker 2>about like the biochemistry of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing addictive behavior in other.</v>

73
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff you've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

74
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're further along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

75
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>The man still like my mind is blown and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly you're like,</v>

76
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a spectrum of behavior.</v>

77
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

78
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>You can think on this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.613
<v Speaker 2>queer person and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well everybody has a sexuality and it's </v>

80
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.974
<v Speaker 2>a spectrum.</v>

81
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinary actually.</v>

82
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's something I've only been learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because I'm probably substantially</v>

83
00:03:59.151 --> 00:03:59.984
<v Speaker 1>older than you and I'm probably educated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different way had difference of </v>

84
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:03.114
<v Speaker 1>cultural references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see something like 40 percent of </v>

85
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:05.384
<v Speaker 1>people under 25 don't identify with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a homogenous sexual group in a </v>

86
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Speaker 1>more interested in fluid of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>even though I think of myself as sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a countercultural person,</v>

88
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

89
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I know me too though.</v>

90
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself as pretty like cool,</v>

91
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.743
<v Speaker 2>but then I do gigs at universities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like freshers wigs and there I don't </v>

92
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.244
<v Speaker 2>know the right terminology and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting my foot in my mouth and they're </v>

93
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.394
<v Speaker 2>so tuned into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got all gender neutral toilets </v>

94
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>and they're all have crazy terms for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and it's awesome.</v>

95
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

96
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>In a way it sort of makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose at what you know,</v>

97
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>someone of my age and older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a very clear identity?</v>

98
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Roles are very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Roles and I,</v>

99
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:47.774
<v Speaker 1>I've been questioning a lot lately what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I would identify it and how I've </v>

100
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.253
<v Speaker 1>grown up if the conversation had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>more advanced in my own adolescence </v>

101
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.154
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the main feeling I had growing up </v>

102
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>in a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary Essex home,</v>

103
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>suburban home was not like the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>

104
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>but turns out that the other boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't like the other boys.</v>

105
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just that we're all magnetized to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an imaginary category.</v>

106
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And whilst there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.453
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is one of the most sort of for </v>

108
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:17.044
<v Speaker 1>most places in there seems like there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a biochemical basis for at least some </v>

109
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of biological and anatomical </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of gender.</v>

110
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

111
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people identify,</v>

112
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.513
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate and represent their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality seems like something that we </v>

113
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>need to examine a look more closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your observations on that?</v>

114
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so</v>

115
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all the way we're talking about,</v>

116
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:39.664
<v Speaker 2>it's all still in its infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in 25 years it'll be so </v>

117
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so hard to sort of disentangle,</v>

118
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural influences and stuff in terms </v>

119
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 2>of gender roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's normal for men and women,</v>

120
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 2>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a biological thing,</v>

121
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 2>but this also I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard.</v>

122
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Undo those early influences about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>masculinity and femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

124
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.073
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if we can disentangle those </v>

125
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.580
<v Speaker 2>people be a lot less stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

126
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.853
<v Speaker 1>we're both sort of androgynous looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people within our sort of basic gender </v>

127
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.840
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're quite a beautiful man.</v>

128
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been told I'm a handsome woman.</v>

129
00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I get that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

130
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I've been doing this,</v>

131
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>when I've been doing this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like,</v>

132
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:23.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when young people are coming to like </v>

133
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.213
<v Speaker 1>sort of signings into my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been having sort of conversations </v>

134
00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that have really opened my mind up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking to a young person and God</v>

135
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:35.220
<v Speaker 1>now we're gonna have to say they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.103
<v Speaker 1>identify as binary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't identify with any particular </v>

137
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:39.344
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really felt myself on the </v>

138
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:40.794
<v Speaker 1>precipice of my own understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own linguistic abilities or my own </v>

139
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

140
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is going to be the key</v>
<v Speaker 1>component here?</v>

141
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:50.394
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed around identity politics is </v>

142
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>people that are sort of our traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>or conservative often feel,</v>

143
00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:57.654
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of shame and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion and it can become quite </v>

144
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 1>opposition or quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

145
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

146
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:04.964
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easy to experience like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real sense of vertigo about it because </v>

147
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just happened so exponentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and,</v>

148
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Speaker 2>and there's all these new words and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like I don't,</v>

149
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you are at math and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

150
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to get this panic and math class,</v>

151
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>like when they would introduce things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Algebra and I and I'd be like,</v>

152
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:22.724
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too much information and you just </v>

153
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 2>dropped out of school pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like.</v>

154
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.543
<v Speaker 2>And I think people have that feeling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the main thing is just asking </v>

155
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.164
<v Speaker 2>questions and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and the people who are </v>

156
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.404
<v Speaker 2>using these new words to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>patiently and we can all just be </v>

157
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 2>patient,</v>

158
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

159
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>how did you look at these themes in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup show?</v>

160
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Where are you personally on these ideas?</v>

161
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Identification I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

162
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>my parents were real hippies and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

163
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>so growing up they were always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

164
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm only just realizing and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving to England,</v>

165
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 2>like how unusual this is that when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid they would always say,</v>

166
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll grow up and you'll meet a man or </v>

167
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:04.394
<v Speaker 2>a woman and it always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just presented it as an equal </v>

168
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 2>option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw who knows if that's by the.</v>

169
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I've always been bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always dated men and women is,</v>

170
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's because they said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that or maybe they were like,</v>

171
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>well she keeps wearing suits and like</v>

172
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>we should have that three piece suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You added onto that magician show first.</v>

173
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You were overdressed for any gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity for a magic.</v>

174
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So tie and suspenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:28.634
<v Speaker 2>So I was lucky in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've always been bisexual and that's </v>

176
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>been great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

177
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 1>what I found surprising as a new father </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a female child grant.</v>

178
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.923
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blowing my mind like it's really </v>

179
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.900
<v Speaker 1>vacillates between this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual sense of Oh wow,</v>

180
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>new consciousness as a merge glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glory that she exists and kind of little</v>

181
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>passed it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get off me.</v>

182
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really pendula experienced because no</v>

183
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no off button,</v>

184
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.483
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've become very sensitive in a way </v>

185
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>that sort of surprises me around </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

186
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess my wife is more traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I am and puts like,</v>

187
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes puts her in dresses and things</v>

188
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 1>like that and sometimes I'm like I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just the way things are practical for</v>

189
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>someone that can't walk up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 1>So she should just be wearing little </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants and stuff,</v>

191
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

192
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and like I don't know because in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at this is that very sort</v>

193
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>of conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old fashioned idea that perhaps I'm a</v>

194
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>man who sort of unconsciously wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a male child.</v>

195
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the,</v>

196
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like any ornamentation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity are now because it feels like</v>

197
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 1>something's been put on her that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not choosing.</v>

198
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did this experiment.</v>

199
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.303
<v Speaker 1>I was get experiments wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is where they had a </v>

200
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 1>baby in neutral clothing in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard this?</v>

201
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:50.514
<v Speaker 1>And then people would come in and play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the baby and sometimes they'd say </v>

202
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:53.784
<v Speaker 1>it's a boy baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when they said it was a boy </v>

203
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:56.664
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was like bouncing it really </v>

204
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not aggressive,</v>

205
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but really physical and always faced the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby looking away from them.</v>

206
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And then when they said it was a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

207
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>they all turn the baby towards them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of cuddled in like,</v>

208
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of.</v>

209
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really conscious of how I talk</v>

210
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>to parents.</v>

211
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you hear a lot when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a bad as people say,</v>

212
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.390
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

213
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.293
<v Speaker 1>they just do start playing with vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaners and if they're a boy they </v>

214
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>immediately signed up to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marines and he said,</v>

215
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.293
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were not aware of the unconscious </v>

216
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:33.490
<v Speaker 1>cues that we have achieved and I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing already.</v>

217
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.373
<v Speaker 1>Have a lot when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a question people like </v>

218
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:37.074
<v Speaker 1>to ask me on chat shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to go where you being such a </v>

219
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.163
<v Speaker 1>womanizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to feel when you do a </v>

220
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>$6 industry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brings home a Russell Bronco.</v>

221
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>She might not bring home a and she might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a gay person.</v>

222
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who she's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home with.</v>

223
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Such questions worked.</v>

224
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.393
<v Speaker 1>I did that too and my friend has an a </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old niece and they came back </v>

225
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.054
<v Speaker 1>from some baby thing where they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your daughter do this trick monkey </v>

226
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 1>music classes and stuff and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents are like,</v>

227
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>they're so talented like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>

228
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 1>They bring the two year old back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I hear myself going,</v>

229
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.574
<v Speaker 1>I guess in this smarmy way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you have a boyfriend yet to the </v>

230
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>to like I'm saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I doing that?</v>

231
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

232
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:17.394
<v Speaker 1>Look at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not unaware of our own </v>

233
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:19.314
<v Speaker 1>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is some like continually within </v>

234
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:22.764
<v Speaker 1>your standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the kind of perspective you try </v>

235
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.554
<v Speaker 1>to have as a comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about your process </v>

236
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:28.344
<v Speaker 1>of conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you come to the idea that </v>

237
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>you were gonna write your very </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful show?</v>

238
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

239
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.303
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like we were saying like I </v>

240
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:37.314
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to talk about drugs </v>

241
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:39.624
<v Speaker 1>and that period and in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I haven't felt like I have </v>

242
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>enough distance from it or perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it to do it in a way where I can keep</v>

243
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:47.934
<v Speaker 1>it really light and be in control of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had a this breakup like two </v>

244
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>years ago and it just felt</v>

245
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 2>so similar to getting off cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was.</v>

246
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.101
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

247
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I know this feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

248
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>And then started reading about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then had this,</v>

249
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started seeing these patterns in all </v>

250
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 2>areas of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I started improvising it onstage</v>

251
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.500
<v Speaker 2>and it was way too dark and then just </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly adding punchlines.</v>

252
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.403
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do like a work in progress and it's </v>

253
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 2>like too serious</v>

254
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.513
<v Speaker 1>and then you add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start off your development process </v>

255
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>is to start with just being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very honest and personal uncomfortably.</v>

256
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So how do you feel what that stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development?</v>

257
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.823
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that kind of </v>

258
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 2>masochistic sometimes isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're like,</v>

259
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no punchline coming so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite intense,</v>

260
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:36.664
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that and then every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>year in Edinburgh I do an improvised </v>

261
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 2>show where people write down questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I answer them and then it comes</v>

262
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:45.214
<v Speaker 2>out of that too because you get to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people want to hear you talk about </v>

263
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:49.760
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

264
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that idea.</v>

265
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:52.534
<v Speaker 1>I have a similar process for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my access point for comedy is to start </v>

266
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:57.934
<v Speaker 1>saying things that are truthful often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually one of my guiding principles </v>

267
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this make me feel a bit ashamed?</v>

268
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ears get hot.</v>

269
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to know that about </v>

270
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:10.350
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>

271
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.223
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that there's something about that </v>

272
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

273
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind me asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of revelations were you making</v>

274
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>about the breakup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of realizations did you have?</v>

275
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've done,</v>

276
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.833
<v Speaker 2>they've compared brain scans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't had like a coke addict and </v>

277
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.463
<v Speaker 2>someone who says they're madly in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so I just think the hormones </v>

278
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>and things are insane and during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>break if I just,</v>

279
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I felt so not like myself and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a.</v>

280
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>So the right thing to do to end up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a relapse and it just,</v>

281
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I was using all this terminology that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

282
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:43.584
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

283
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

284
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.133
<v Speaker 2>and not the healthiest relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and how can you lose yourself so </v>

285
00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>completely in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

286
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.260
<v Speaker 2>So a damaging relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best.</v>

287
00:13:55.261 --> 00:13:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

288
00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.300
<v Speaker 2>And in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

289
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.310
<v Speaker 2>not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

290
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

291
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.330
<v Speaker 1>They were punishing components to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only recently started,</v>

292
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something sometimes I think I'm </v>

293
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 1>really clever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I realized,</v>

294
00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:07.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not clever,</v>

295
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.213
<v Speaker 1>you're like an idiot because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes much too long to realize and </v>

296
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.500
<v Speaker 1>really sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like a convoluted,</v>

297
00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:17.090
<v Speaker 1>complex neurological root to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most basic observations.</v>

298
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Like for sure it's healthy and nature is</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

299
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still working on nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

300
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Very long thesis of examination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grass,</v>

301
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.860
<v Speaker 1>the color green photosynthesis into </v>
<v Speaker 1>connectivity,</v>

302
00:14:31.861 --> 00:14:33.350
<v Speaker 1>the role of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that for ages before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

304
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.903
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just go for a walk in the </v>

305
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:37.820
<v Speaker 1>woods you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

306
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.140
<v Speaker 1>like it's taken me a long time to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to terms with that.</v>

307
00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:40.974
<v Speaker 1>But I noticed that my own tendency in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships without being disparaging </v>

308
00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:47.520
<v Speaker 1>about the particular individuals I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationships with was set up,</v>

309
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic situations,</v>

310
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>producing situations.</v>

311
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And then it's so euphoric when you sued </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anxiety.</v>

312
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.814
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the agenda and obviously a </v>

313
00:14:58.771 --> 00:14:59.604
<v Speaker 1>analogist to addiction that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually find yourself at a place </v>

314
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 1>where I'm not good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to call.</v>

315
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fantastic now to maintain this.</v>

316
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.283
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking only pretend to be someone else </v>

317
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:14.180
<v Speaker 1>for another five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we can have a child.</v>

318
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is a little.</v>

320
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:18.044
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes I think that substance </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction is the most rational form of </v>

321
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.553
<v Speaker 1>addiction because it's a direct route to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good feeling instead of the other </v>

322
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 1>ones are quite convoluted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

323
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:29.361
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

324
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>and easier to control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

325
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.350
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have sort of a reliable </v>
<v Speaker 1>hookup,</v>

326
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.933
<v Speaker 1>access to cocaine and heroin or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug is young people take these days is </v>

327
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.483
<v Speaker 1>can be much easier than the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>giddy all for a vertiginous experience </v>

328
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>of being in love.</v>

329
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of what your show is </v>

330
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 1>about is it is about how your drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction as a young person leading,</v>

331
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:54.074
<v Speaker 1>you'll be expelled from the family home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found those patterns repeating </v>

332
00:15:57.231 --> 00:15:59.910
<v Speaker 1>themselves in romantic situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

333
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.943
<v Speaker 1>I think I always just thought I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to drugs and then I went to </v>

334
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:04.244
<v Speaker 1>Rehab and then I've been clean ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since and I never really thought about </v>

335
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:06.764
<v Speaker 1>it with much more depth and then now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking or I mean early on when I was </v>

336
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>about six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had mad obsession with Bette midler.</v>

337
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the world through this lens of Bet</v>

338
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Midler that just everything's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relation to bet midler.</v>

339
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I was so obsessed with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every is in relation to pet mate.</v>

340
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would bet?</v>

341
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's she wearing today?</v>

342
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I loved her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my grades were slipping at school</v>

343
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:30.014
<v Speaker 1>because I was just sitting thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Batman and then comedy and then </v>

344
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.560
<v Speaker 1>drugs and then relationships.</v>

345
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Midler was your gateway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

346
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.660
<v Speaker 1>What was it about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it beat?</v>

347
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.720
<v Speaker 1>She's Hocus pocus at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one where they are,</v>

348
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a little kid in Canada,</v>

349
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you're in a little three piece suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally this went,</v>

350
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw it 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 times in cinemas and it just,</v>

351
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must've been at a sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must've had a crush on bet midler and </v>

352
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I just lost my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

353
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.333
<v Speaker 1>she's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is innovation capacity that she's </v>

354
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Sassy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong woman.</v>

355
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.930
<v Speaker 1>She'd take care of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't she?</v>

356
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she tells us like it.</v>

357
00:17:12.571 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

358
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Then hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting a bit sexual and she'd sort</v>

359
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 1>of cut you down quite cruelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you know what I mean?</v>

360
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>It would be a benefit flash and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>beck goes,</v>

361
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.770
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing called me out and she goes,</v>

362
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:31.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

363
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm getting into like,</v>

364
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at her lovingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

365
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.230
<v Speaker 1>why don't you take a picture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll last longer.</v>

366
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on and off for you.</v>

367
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.783
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

368
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>once I saw her accepted an award at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Golden Globes and she said,</v>

369
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 1>how about these couple of Golden Globes </v>
<v Speaker 1>gesturing to no breasts?</v>

370
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's her style.</v>

371
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>And some food went all unusual in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something glitched eman.</v>

372
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I've felt a feeling feeling in my tummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All unusual.</v>

373
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.163
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think this is something </v>

374
00:17:58.591 --> 00:17:59.424
<v Speaker 1>essential?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously bet midler isn't gay </v>

375
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:02.590
<v Speaker 1>icon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

376
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:03.983
<v Speaker 1>Odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you would have had any over or </v>

377
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:06.834
<v Speaker 1>cultural sense of a gender or sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity that you would automatically </v>

378
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:10.734
<v Speaker 1>found yourself to sort of some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>quintessential figure within the </v>

379
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Pantheon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

380
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it was just into witches as</v>

381
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:19.940
<v Speaker 1>well though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I any kind of design,</v>

382
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit.</v>

383
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>There was another one when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal street,</v>

384
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:25.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the others or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Jessica Parker could have gone for</v>

385
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not into it.</v>

386
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Just because she was the most evil I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

387
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her voice and.</v>

388
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:31.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

389
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

390
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it must've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens a lot though.</v>

391
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was obsessed with scary spice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a child and then now I'm like,</v>

392
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:39.054
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of a gay icon to look at </v>

393
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's weird,</v>

394
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:42.774
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think a lot about constructs </v>

395
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.773
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not we're attaching to these </v>

396
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:48.714
<v Speaker 1>things or if there isn't a central truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way this crosses over with some of </v>

397
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.493
<v Speaker 1>young's ideas of synchronicity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something happening on a </v>

398
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 1>psychic level that is relating to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world.</v>

399
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Whereas of course the materialist will </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you know,</v>

400
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:01.734
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are just over patterns that </v>

401
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 1>signify nothing.</v>

402
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Things are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>material value.</v>

403
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:10.911
<v Speaker 1>But if you as a little kid into Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've somehow happened upon gay icon,</v>

404
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Speaker 1>not in a particular content and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

405
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Your identity is more complex than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just interesting that,</v>

406
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that figure is she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've never understood.</v>

407
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Bette Midler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not gay or anything.</v>

408
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Is it a particular person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her confidence and,</v>

410
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.921
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

411
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

412
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

413
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 1>when people in huge numbers respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing quite emotionally,</v>

414
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.010
<v Speaker 1>then yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there must be some universal.</v>

415
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youngian thing that you're responding to</v>

416
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be just that there's a great pr</v>

417
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.703
<v Speaker 1>team or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be some central resonance </v>

418
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:46.734
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you graduate to a after Bet </v>

419
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Midler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily in terms of crushes,</v>

420
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

421
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.190
<v Speaker 1>what would you feel like your next </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment and then comedy.</v>

422
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.023
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 11 and 13 niche comedy and I </v>

423
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:01.584
<v Speaker 1>started doing standup when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had braces and I'd be in my school </v>

424
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:09.441
<v Speaker 1>uniform and come from school smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird sort of circus act and um,</v>

425
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.870
<v Speaker 1>did it every night of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

426
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's a highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any other isn't it?</v>

427
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was your APP like?</v>

428
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

429
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>you've got some props,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing.</v>

430
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

431
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.993
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I went through so many different </v>

432
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.990
<v Speaker 1>just imitating people based because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know who I was.</v>

433
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder phase where I was just doing,</v>

434
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but basically bill Hicks and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

435
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.973
<v Speaker 1>smoking three piece suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little kid like character knighted </v>

436
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 1>character stuff and just tried all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

437
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>All so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

438
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Like no one had smartphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting?</v>

439
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:45.834
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I identify with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>May is this idea of being a little kid </v>

440
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:51.274
<v Speaker 1>and not feeling particularly connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the place where I was and feeling a </v>

441
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 1>little bit lost and adrift and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

442
00:20:58.841 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

443
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:04.290
<v Speaker 1>when a first sort of via my cousin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard the smiths and then sort of looked</v>

444
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 1>into the character of Morrissey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd think,</v>

445
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

446
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:08.314
<v Speaker 1>this guy and let you know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that's beautifying outsiderness </v>

447
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerability and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a bit of an access point.</v>

448
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And then like through Morrissey you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn about,</v>

449
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:21.904
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrissey's interchange deems you start </v>

450
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.670
<v Speaker 1>getting into that type of cinema and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrissey's into Oscar Wilde.</v>

451
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You start learning about Oscar Wilde and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 1>then you get into aesthetics is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

453
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:30.941
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How sort of,</v>

454
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as opposed as a person.</v>

455
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:33.664
<v Speaker 1>My framework for understanding reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is spirituality and specifically </v>

456
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 1>spirituality through the Lens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

457
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's about understanding how I form </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachments,</v>

458
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.783
<v Speaker 1>but culture does have a great potency </v>
<v Speaker 1>and can be a way to understand yourself </v>

459
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 1>in a situation in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has great beauty in it,</v>

460
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.630
<v Speaker 1>so and like Bill Hicks again was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant figure for me because like,</v>

461
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in I suppose slightly more sophisticated</v>

462
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:01.240
<v Speaker 1>way and perhaps a more mature way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I was an adult when</v>

463
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I first saw Bill Hicks and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

464
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that's how you're supposed to do stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up comedy.</v>

465
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.203
<v Speaker 1>I've been very curious to be a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid and trying to appropriate </v>

466
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:09.844
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

467
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I must have.</v>

468
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hard to remember how I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time and I must've felt a sense </v>

469
00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:16.784
<v Speaker 2>of otherness and then especially in high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and probably feeling a bit gay </v>

470
00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:21.794
<v Speaker 2>and then go in and find in a comedy club</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people were not only like </v>

471
00:22:25.701 --> 00:22:27.710
<v Speaker 2>declaring what was different about them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and weird,</v>

472
00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 2>but then being applauded for it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

473
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that's probably pretty mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it true here?</v>

474
00:22:35.301 --> 00:22:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking at my notes that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned up smoking a cigarette like quite</v>

475
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.013
<v Speaker 2>early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were smoking cigarettes on </v>

476
00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought comedian smoke.</v>

477
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was that scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Richard Pryor and stuff.</v>

478
00:22:45.321 --> 00:22:46.250
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

479
00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:46.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

480
00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I went on with a cigarette and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were just,</v>

481
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were so it was silent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were,</v>

482
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.300
<v Speaker 2>it was like concerned silence because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

483
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.610
<v Speaker 2>who has allowed this to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who should we,</v>

484
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.893
<v Speaker 2>should we notify and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some notification so that you </v>

485
00:23:01.561 --> 00:23:02.890
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the famous</v>

486
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.250
<v Speaker 1>second city of the second series I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started in Chicago,</v>

487
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:06.084
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of like a byword for sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of improvisational brilliance and sort </v>

488
00:23:08.761 --> 00:23:11.460
<v Speaker 1>of the sort of vanguard of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

489
00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So you were involved when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid in that world.</v>

490
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.250
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

491
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started.</v>

492
00:23:15.261 --> 00:23:16.094
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

493
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I started out there for a few years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

494
00:23:18.571 --> 00:23:19.404
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then eventually when drugs kind of </v>

495
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.333
<v Speaker 2>took over and replaced comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got banned from second city for </v>

496
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:29.820
<v Speaker 2>two years from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was devastating because I loved</v>

497
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it and idolized all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think suddenly everyone twigs,</v>

498
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.453
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person is too young to be so high </v>

499
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:39.450
<v Speaker 2>all the time in this building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I got banned from there.</v>

500
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.540
<v Speaker 2>But what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything like mostly coke was,</v>

501
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 2>it was the big one.</v>

502
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was disposable cash from comedy to.</v>

503
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I think I just don't give a teenager any</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

504
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a very natural conclusion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have reminders attended.</v>

505
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't do what?</v>

506
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Buy Models and factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even then there's the clue.</v>

507
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.243
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find your way to </v>

508
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got cash you can pay with cash</v>

509
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>in hand for gates much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:08.294
<v Speaker 1>And then it's around and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I guess I obviously had this </v>

511
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>predisposition because a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to coke and never want to do it again.</v>

512
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.791
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 1>We have the predisposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing drugs with adults?</v>

514
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Time.</v>

515
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.613
<v Speaker 1>That's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

516
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking back,</v>

517
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time it felt so natural because I</v>

518
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't give a child drugs not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out on a limb.</v>

519
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 1>But so I suppose thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I got heroin it was often</v>

521
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they really.</v>

522
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got that now.</v>

523
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:43.070
<v Speaker 1>If they were Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always assumed they were Turkish,</v>

524
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's just my personal bigotry </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were so young,</v>

525
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.470
<v Speaker 1>dark skinned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glads in Hackney,</v>

526
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.420
<v Speaker 1>19 myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were possibly 13.</v>

527
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.263
<v Speaker 1>They're adorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jared guys to skinning up with heroin </v>

528
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>and I've got some off of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

529
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you might imagine,</v>

530
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.480
<v Speaker 1>and really that's of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

531
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.323
<v Speaker 1>so you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had the access to the world of </v>

532
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:08.024
<v Speaker 1>comedy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sort of blended headlong into </v>

533
00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into diction,</v>

534
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you were dealing drugs as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

535
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very,</v>

536
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I think I was with these adults who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs.</v>

537
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it was very convincing about not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a teenager.</v>

538
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean they knew I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was.</v>

539
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.553
<v Speaker 1>I think I really did my best to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone at ease with doing drugs with </v>

540
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:29.450
<v Speaker 1>me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a big deal.</v>

541
00:25:29.451 --> 00:25:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.243
<v Speaker 1>they weren't villains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are definitely some </v>

543
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.600
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate behavior for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the,</v>

545
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug dealing in any good at drug den</v>

546
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:44.381
<v Speaker 1>and we're now tell me the key problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it just terrible at it,</v>

547
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:46.664
<v Speaker 1>bad at math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at selfcontrol I'm sort of going a </v>

548
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:51.644
<v Speaker 1>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money gets quite scary very </v>

549
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

550
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably you broke biggie smalls.</v>

551
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 1>He's golden rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get high on your own supply.</v>

552
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Learned from biggie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a small amount of miserable </v>

553
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.500
<v Speaker 1>measly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful drug dealing myself.</v>

554
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mate mark gave me quite a lot of </v>

555
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.034
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said sell that your school and you </v>

556
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>couldn't make some profits and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>business model.</v>

557
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.920
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was is that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with a couple of bigger boys and</v>

558
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.403
<v Speaker 1>like took some of those drugs and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't keep charging them because of </v>

559
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:28.034
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like they was too much fear in </v>

560
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:29.834
<v Speaker 1>the relationship and I ended up swapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bicycle and I took too much of them </v>

561
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines and it ruined my </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance was macbeth,</v>

562
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>if I may say so I think I'd feel a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

563
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I would pay so much money to see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing macbeth as a teen.</v>

564
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't have liked it maybe because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was regarded as a failure when you </v>

565
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:49.284
<v Speaker 1>were at drama school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They divide up a play into all the </v>

566
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 1>various,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.783
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's got to have a go at </v>

568
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:53.994
<v Speaker 1>being macbeth in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing one bit the bit I was </v>

569
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just murdered king down Kinedyne.</v>

570
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.633
<v Speaker 1>I feel familiar with the play and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out with the DAC is right or sort </v>

571
00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:05.034
<v Speaker 1>of he's just done a terrible murder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels awful about it and I shouldn't </v>

572
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:08.964
<v Speaker 1>have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because I wasn't the type of actor </v>

573
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>would do any prep instead of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought speed.</v>

574
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.193
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've done some speed instead of like </v>

575
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 1>learning about dockers and murders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

576
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:21.714
<v Speaker 1>So I come staggering out as a kite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got butter knives out of the </v>

577
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:25.250
<v Speaker 1>canteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

578
00:27:25.251 --> 00:27:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that you wouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder a king with those butter knives.</v>

579
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did you had you learned the words or</v>

580
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:32.514
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

581
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I learned those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what it would have been like</v>

582
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Speaker 1>an amphetamine drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make you.</v>

583
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it doesn't put you in the pit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your belly.</v>

584
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It takes you into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts you into the upper Chakras,</v>

585
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 1>whereas I think doing a murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be really in your guts.</v>

586
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very earthy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

587
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:48.624
<v Speaker 1>To murder someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly for your ad out to do it </v>

588
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 1>with a butter knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd been plunged into those ribs.</v>

589
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

590
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>your pupils are dilated to be sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

591
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:56.963
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I fought that while I was doing </v>

592
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.244
<v Speaker 1>was a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know at the end when they tell </v>

593
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you whether or not you had done a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

594
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 1>the teacher said that was not a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

595
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.353
<v Speaker 1>Unanimously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one lad in the year below said off </v>

596
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 1>what you were good the way you've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

597
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It was mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

598
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:13.854
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll clean mark where he was not a </v>

599
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:18.324
<v Speaker 1>person whose opinion could be relied </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon and it doesn't have any Kudos </v>

600
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:21.840
<v Speaker 1>within the school system.</v>

601
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Certainly I couldn't use it to press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

602
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 1>that loud in the low year for I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

603
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas when I was in year four,</v>

604
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe I was eight or nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did Charlie Brown and I played Charlie</v>

605
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Brown is like my crowning moment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and uh,</v>

606
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I took it so seriously that I did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>monologue in it and I cried real tears.</v>

607
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I really went for it and there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

608
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

609
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was horrified.</v>

610
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 1>They thought something had gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why was it about Charlie's monologue</v>

611
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that made you think tears would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate?</v>

612
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:57.024
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

613
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.893
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting at lunch and there's this </v>

614
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.653
<v Speaker 1>girl over there and she's ignoring him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just wants to share his peanut </v>

615
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 1>butter sandwich and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

616
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:06.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody likes me.</v>

617
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And that I really went for it.</v>

618
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I got a really felt that my parents were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like waving at me,</v>

619
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 1>crying a little ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floods of tears.</v>

620
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Brown over what some would think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of as a minor misdemeanor,</v>

621
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:20.004
<v Speaker 1>but I think in that were the seeds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would become a great career as a </v>

622
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 1>performer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you've talked about in</v>

623
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:27.414
<v Speaker 1>your show a dope is sort of neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scientific representations of what </v>

624
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you've experienced personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit about that.</v>

625
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

626
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.543
<v Speaker 1>I've watched some Ted Talks I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely will get it all wrong I </v>

627
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.804
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's this some addiction </v>

628
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 1>specialist called Gabor metallic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know him?</v>

629
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by him.</v>

630
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:49.804
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this book last night and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we're going to get him on this </v>

631
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him for him and he's like,</v>

632
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 1>he could have a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so amazing.</v>

633
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>His voice is so deep and he'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd love to speak to him.</v>

634
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.480
<v Speaker 1>We interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me all about it.</v>

635
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

636
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 1>he talks about dopamine levels and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

637
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

638
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the theories is if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopamine deficiency,</v>

639
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>then when you do get a hit of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure chemical,</v>

640
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 1>it's so overwhelming and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cravings really intense.</v>

641
00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:16.924
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he talks about and about </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the origins of addiction and </v>

642
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.573
<v Speaker 1>in early childhood where your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry is all getting wired up and </v>

643
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that can be quite uncomfortable.</v>

644
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I think looking at your own early </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

645
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

646
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It's hard as an because you want to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>full responsibility for all your actions</v>

647
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 1>and you never want to feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>casting blame,</v>

648
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:41.020
<v Speaker 1>especially on your parents who you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody.</v>

649
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're so fragile and we've all </v>
<v Speaker 1>got weird.</v>

650
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the challenges I think my,</v>

651
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.943
<v Speaker 1>if the logical model of addiction is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of places people that are addicts </v>

652
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.353
<v Speaker 1>in the position of a kind of sufferer </v>
<v Speaker 1>through anything about it and we'll </v>

653
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Poli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also lets the culture of the hook.</v>

654
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is sort of so many cultural </v>

655
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:07.264
<v Speaker 1>forces that you want imagined and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to suggest exacerbate addiction </v>

656
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.930
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

657
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.960
<v Speaker 1>persecution in talking particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>about within America.</v>

658
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to note the theories of</v>

659
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.603
<v Speaker 1>the dopamine deficiency could be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biochemical root of what we identify as </v>

660
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would also make sense of the idea</v>

661
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 1>that the patterns are replicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the object,</v>

662
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a sort of a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship of substance,</v>

663
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:42.910
<v Speaker 1>a career in comedy or Bet Midler who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of chasing the same thing.</v>

664
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

665
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

666
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm also been really interested in.</v>

667
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how like how malleable </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are and how your,</v>

668
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.373
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can affect your brain chemistry </v>

669
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 1>with just things like your social </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

670
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.594
<v Speaker 1>I mean even now as adults and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>boost your dopamine levels of exercise </v>

671
00:31:58.811 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know.</v>

672
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 1>We were so malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

673
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:04.620
<v Speaker 1>you had a sort of a fatalistic model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

674
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:05.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just this,</v>

675
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:06.144
<v Speaker 1>this is how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I'm learning that now </v>

676
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.073
<v Speaker 1>go and live in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stimulate yourself into a frenzy </v>

677
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 1>to meditate twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do exercise,</v>

678
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.353
<v Speaker 1>don't look at pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sort of like very sort of simple </v>

679
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>rules of how to create a spice in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

680
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:24.520
<v Speaker 1>That's pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still getting there.</v>

681
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

682
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 1>everything he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so nice.</v>

683
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your life like now?</v>

684
00:32:28.661 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>My mind just running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my phone a lot.</v>

685
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably drank too much.</v>

686
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

687
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exercise,</v>

688
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat really well.</v>

689
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's balance isn't it?</v>

690
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I know I should live in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should live in the woods,</v>

691
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

692
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hot down.</v>

693
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:46.604
<v Speaker 1>Then would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why haven't you got embraced an </v>

694
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 1>abstinent model if you've identified as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an addict's quite early in your life?</v>

695
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to be a really puritanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>and judgmental now for a bit.</v>

696
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

697
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

698
00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

699
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

700
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look good.</v>

701
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I know you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the next thing to go probably,</v>

702
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:10.150
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot a,</v>

703
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

704
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.653
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is interesting when you in that </v>

705
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had these weird little rushing</v>

706
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 1>early life.</v>

707
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I was like 24 and I was being on MTV and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a radio show on Xfm.</v>

708
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was even coming out of one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bloody rooms,</v>

709
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.440
<v Speaker 1>like this one was certainly this </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

710
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.620
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like at that point was </v>
<v Speaker 1>escalating as a drug addict,</v>

711
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:28.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you sign,</v>

712
00:33:28.231 --> 00:33:29.064
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a young person you had access </v>

713
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:33.530
<v Speaker 1>suddenly to ready money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just addiction fuel,</v>

714
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.850
<v Speaker 1>what they must have paid me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin saved me the exchange,</v>

715
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like now that you're,</v>

716
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 1>now that you're at this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're becoming successful,</v>

717
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:42.794
<v Speaker 1>you're on the precipice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine have a sort of a </v>

718
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.133
<v Speaker 1>different kind of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tipping point where we're probably </v>

719
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:48.540
<v Speaker 1>going to get your own TV show soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>

720
00:33:48.541 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 1>or make a film and those kinds of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably going to happen.</v>

721
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.200
<v Speaker 1>So like what are you going to do to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable?</v>

722
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Straight and narrow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

723
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

724
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I've practiced pretty rigorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

725
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and things.</v>

726
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:10.961
<v Speaker 1>I go to Ebay and I and I surround myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>with really good people and yeah.</v>

727
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.003
<v Speaker 1>So you're in support groups and during </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy I go to support groups and I'm </v>

728
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.560
<v Speaker 1>also in fair Ipi and I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm continually looking for is what</v>

729
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>is the most recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.623
<v Speaker 1>like or covenant rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the current manifestation of my </v>

731
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>addictive behavior and that's when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to give them the,</v>

732
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.623
<v Speaker 1>as we've talked through your root in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a seemingly innocuous and </v>

733
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:35.450
<v Speaker 1>culturally recognizable and acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of addiction,</v>

734
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:36.284
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until he eventually necessarily in fact </v>

735
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:38.324
<v Speaker 1>deposits you if you're an extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addicts were right in the ass end of </v>

736
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 1>chemical dependency or if you'd have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>less severe strain,</v>

737
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 1>one can hover along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of in banal forms of mental tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 1>through addiction.</v>

739
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.433
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I have to do is sort of like look </v>

740
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 1>at like the thing that I like about a 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>step recovery,</v>

741
00:34:54.531 --> 00:34:55.364
<v Speaker 1>the top recovery I believe in is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings you to a place that's </v>

742
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>recognizable from other forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality.</v>

743
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I stay in the moment trying not to be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>self obsessed.</v>

744
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Do Service for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things that like,</v>

745
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:10.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this crops up in every bloody religion.</v>

746
00:35:10.911 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of really,</v>

747
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:16.190
<v Speaker 1>really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff keeps cropping up.</v>

748
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the route to the solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

749
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.983
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

750
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being vigilant and uh,</v>

751
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get into nature though.</v>

752
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really bad with technology.</v>

753
00:35:29.241 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>How are you with that with your five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I like what I've done now,</v>

754
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 1>my friend over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenny who works here,</v>

755
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.323
<v Speaker 1>I don't have my password no more for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for twitter because what I do is I tell </v>

756
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:43.194
<v Speaker 1>myself I'm just because I'm on a book to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just having a look for business reasons </v>

757
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 1>for long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

758
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you get too deep into it and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those apps are designed now.</v>

759
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.303
<v Speaker 1>People that have been there come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicone Valley and works and those </v>

760
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 1>projects are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.860
<v Speaker 1>that will deliberately designed to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trigger a response.</v>

762
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might decide that they're attractive</v>

763
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

764
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's bloody bullring done to do that,</v>

765
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

766
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone kind of casually says,</v>

767
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:12.234
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all addicted to our phones and </v>

768
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:13.741
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no guys,</v>

769
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>we are all addicted to our phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite,</v>

770
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.883
<v Speaker 1>it's quite bad guys because like one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things I've said in this article </v>

771
00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that was written in the Guardian the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day was that like,</v>

772
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 1>is something that your attention is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being continually competed for.</v>

773
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how to come down.</v>

774
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.110
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes the desire to look at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone is so overwhelming.</v>

775
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like light and the guy,</v>

776
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 1>this guy that designed the like button </v>
<v Speaker 1>for facebook before that,</v>

777
00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 1>it had been some other type of button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came up with it.</v>

778
00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just some sort of 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he does it,</v>

779
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 1>drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even conceptualize my mind.</v>

780
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.603
<v Speaker 1>But you came up with a light button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he don't even bring his phone </v>

781
00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 1>upstairs no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plugs it in,</v>

782
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 1>in the kitchen at 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM and that's it.</v>

783
00:36:56.611 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like it.</v>

784
00:36:58.261 --> 00:36:59.094
<v Speaker 1>He's had his personal assistant deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>like take all the child proofing on his </v>

785
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he himself can't download apps,</v>

786
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.863
<v Speaker 1>so the people that know the score about </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech saying watch it because David </v>

787
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Foster Wallace perspicacious Lee 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago or whenever he sadly died was </v>

788
00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.070
<v Speaker 1>saying we're going to win this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>handheld phones.</v>

789
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

790
00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly smartphones,</v>

791
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 1>he was saying we're not far away from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society where you're staring at a screen</v>

792
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:23.814
<v Speaker 1>all the time and the people on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of it don't love you and they just </v>

793
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>want to sell things to you.</v>

794
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And now we are living in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

795
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's also worrying with parenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

796
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:34.494
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see families out and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this screen between the child and the </v>

797
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 1>parent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

798
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 1>that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doctor talks about it,</v>

799
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 1>about gap or does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's because it's not a physical</v>

800
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:46.344
<v Speaker 1>separation with the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's proximal separation because </v>

801
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you're not making eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not connecting.</v>

802
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And that stuff is so crucial for brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

803
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proximal separation?</v>

804
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.363
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it means not physically </v>

805
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:00.834
<v Speaker 1>separated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're separate because you're in a </v>

806
00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:03.024
<v Speaker 1>different space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately like approximate </v>

807
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 1>approximately proxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

808
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the little kid in this case,</v>

809
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:13.790
<v Speaker 1>my little kid in the night garden on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bloody special ipad that bought for</v>

810
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:15.384
<v Speaker 1>children because a like the thing is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the child does prefer in the night </v>

811
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 1>guard than to us.</v>

812
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like given the choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you asked it,</v>

813
00:38:24.131 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 1>it was you want to live with in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night guards or your parents would go in</v>

814
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 1>the night guard and I don't even care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

815
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.263
<v Speaker 1>They're idiots on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if that one with the beard </v>

816
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>been like that is what people might call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

817
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:36.904
<v Speaker 1>a cheap joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a joke nonetheless to be </v>

818
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 1>encouraged in my ongoing quest to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>up jokes.</v>

819
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come in and my mindset is you identified</v>

820
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 1>as an addict quite quite early in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

821
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.933
<v Speaker 1>You're a person that's on the periphery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and precipice of interesting cultural </v>

822
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:51.994
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're old enough to understand it and </v>

823
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:53.734
<v Speaker 1>to present it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been working from lived </v>

824
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:56.030
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

825
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

826
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you're going to do now.</v>

827
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to go on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

828
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's my first tour of dope.</v>

829
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very different tour.</v>

830
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.710
<v Speaker 1>The show called dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

831
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's uh,</v>

832
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting untrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stain and ibis hotels.</v>

833
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they got like a machine in the </v>

835
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 1>corridor that sells food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's even be in the bed and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>washing your hands at the same time.</v>

837
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 1>There's like a little sink like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom is within.</v>

838
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 1>That could be convenient in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

839
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it's troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

840
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 1>My best hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an Ivus hotel option bird.</v>

841
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 1>You're washing your hands in the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're laying there in the bed.</v>

842
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>You're on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you started?</v>

843
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I start tonight.</v>

844
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Oxford and then a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>playhouse,</v>

845
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 1>a glee club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glee Club.</v>

846
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.593
<v Speaker 1>Ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The glee club for your whole touring </v>

847
00:39:47.981 --> 00:39:48.681
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

848
00:39:48.681 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that crazy.</v>

849
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It shows a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about 18 shows in total,</v>

850
00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 1>so it's pretty cash.</v>

851
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll get friends to come visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I think it'll be fun.</v>

852
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.190
<v Speaker 1>And then I meant to be writing a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

853
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

854
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.720
<v Speaker 1>for 14 year olds about sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

855
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And write it while I'm on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

856
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's quickly promote properly the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine in a standup show.</v>

857
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do people get tickets for that?</v>

858
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're on May,</v>

859
00:40:12.981 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Martin Dot net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on my mind.</v>

860
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Don't net buy tickets to see my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I anticipate in this show?</v>

861
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I hate that question when I'm asked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can pose it better.</v>

862
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Tell us something about your show </v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

863
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.993
<v Speaker 1>That's good to promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's everything we just talked </v>

864
00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with them jokes kind of.</v>

865
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:31.683
<v Speaker 1>What kind of meetings do you go in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you mostly in this type of mood or </v>

866
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 1>do you sometimes go jacket and Matt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouty or like,</v>

867
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Charlie Brown performance?</v>

868
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.963
<v Speaker 1>I mostly like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess I get a little more </v>

869
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.293
<v Speaker 1>energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm mostly like this extremely </v>

870
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 1>affable banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm,</v>

871
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm affable onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

872
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likable,</v>

873
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:51.730
<v Speaker 1>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what's good is,</v>

874
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.564
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while dealing with this complex new </v>

875
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:57.050
<v Speaker 1>language around identity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

876
00:40:57.051 --> 00:40:57.884
<v Speaker 1>the older people having to reexamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>their unconscious prejudices is nice to </v>

877
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.990
<v Speaker 1>meet people that are potentially able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain and convey that information,</v>

878
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.433
<v Speaker 1>but don't press buttons that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade or so ago would have prevented </v>

879
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get loads of people.</v>

880
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more when I talked about sexuality a</v>

881
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:19.984
<v Speaker 1>lot on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get people bringing their parents </v>

882
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 1>and then coming out to their parents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of me.</v>

883
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:24.634
<v Speaker 1>Like they'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd wait to meet me and then they </v>

884
00:41:25.911 --> 00:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>choose that moment to say to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

885
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay.</v>

886
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so not equipped to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediate that exchange.</v>

887
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 1>But it was amazing and I guess they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents had just seen the show.</v>

888
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:37.570
<v Speaker 1>So they're feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

889
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 1>they were in a positive mood and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one time a girl said,</v>

890
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bisexual.</v>

891
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And then her dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

892
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

893
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they asked if I wanted to go to</v>

894
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.400
<v Speaker 1>ga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why our CEO Bisexual?</v>

895
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And he was fucking every night he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

896
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:58.580
<v Speaker 1>why do you think I have this earring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally said that.</v>

897
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That's my boss texture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leering that are way out.</v>

898
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

899
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.253
<v Speaker 1>Because you go like the priest of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out into sort of a modern gender </v>

900
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.730
<v Speaker 1>fluidity and sexual fluidity and freeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself from previous paradigms.</v>

901
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.713
<v Speaker 1>I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a ill-equipped </v>

902
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.583
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get people off and confessing </v>

903
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:17.690
<v Speaker 1>their gay things to me.</v>

904
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Like people going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife is in the toilet,</v>

905
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 1>but I just need to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did give a blow job once and I'm like,</v>

906
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:23.594
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

907
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to show that just using you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a vessel for their shame about</v>

909
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 1>their sexuality is a great pity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

910
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 1>That we've become unable to live our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadows.</v>

911
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.583
<v Speaker 1>That our culture has taught us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are aspects of our sexual </v>

912
00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>self and identity self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're unacceptable.</v>

913
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.163
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live feeling shame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and nothing's going to come see </v>

914
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:50.070
<v Speaker 1>your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows what the post show river.</v>

915
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of stuff.</v>

916
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now talking about addiction.</v>

917
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.224
<v Speaker 1>Do you get loads of people coming after </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and talking about their own </v>

918
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 1>experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about something on the age of my mind </v>

936
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.770
<v Speaker 1>about saying he wouldn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too deep.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Then people come up and like maybe get.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we've.</v>

939

<v Speaker 1>instagram looking at your to impressing,</v>

940
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.550

<v Speaker 1>dash.</v>

941
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a lot of that.</v>

942
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just very entrepreneurial.</v>

943
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.523
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why don't you try a bit of that </v>

944
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.470
<v Speaker 1>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

945
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm very available to available after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

946
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Are you a single person currently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

947
00:44:18.851 --> 00:44:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

948
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dangerous on tour,</v>

949
00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people.</v>

950
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get a lot of couples actually.</v>

951
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be my niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we want to have a go.</v>

952
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the propositions I get from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

953
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old inculcation and acculturation early </v>

954
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:37.974
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been that at ease around </v>

955
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:40.314
<v Speaker 1>males and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been at an orgy where there's been </v>

956
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:43.854
<v Speaker 1>men and I was a younger man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was involved in a few free sums that </v>

957
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:51.231
<v Speaker 1>had to man in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the gentleness.</v>

958
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 1>A nurturer of femininity very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonated with me.</v>

959
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:59.750
<v Speaker 1>When you talked about Miss Midler's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Po Matriarch,</v>

960
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>some of the energy I'm going for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

961
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 1>that sort of literally a married man </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a baby and incredibly happy now,</v>

962
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:09.510
<v Speaker 1>but if we're going to talk about one </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual brand,</v>

963
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 1>is that stuff but you couples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

964
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:13.943
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get.</v>

965
00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I get propositions from couples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

966
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Post your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds amazing.</v>

967
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Blow Job Punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

968
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:21.264
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to come home with us </v>

969
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:25.583
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

970
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Coming on May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty exciting.</v>

971
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just get straight back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody cabin.</v>

973
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Back to the MYP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to a manager.</v>

974
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll be slamming that vandal shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locked me away.</v>

975
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And the Ivus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that really an Egyptian bird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

977
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:41.754
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like that might be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably some sort of store </v>

978
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 1>probably deliver of new life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why would they have selected that</v>

979
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:49.440
<v Speaker 1>word will work out eventually everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>reappropriated by the corporate world.</v>

980
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:50.274
<v Speaker 1>Everything rebranded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you ever take up these couples on </v>

981
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:52.771
<v Speaker 1>their mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer,</v>

982
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildly inappropriate personal question,</v>

983
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.830
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you answer that?</v>

984
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ha,</v>

985
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I have but not post show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.513
<v Speaker 1>You got to meet up any good or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get sort of caught up in the social </v>

987
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:05.310
<v Speaker 1>dynamics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I think,</v>

988
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:06.144
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind if it was three </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who just met my favorite </v>

989
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.710
<v Speaker 1>days because with a couple they've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own thing.</v>

990
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 1>They keep telling each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love each other throughout.</v>

991
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newer on the age.</v>

992
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.413
<v Speaker 1>Nobody loves me once as a younger man in</v>
<v Speaker 1>freer and more liberal type day from </v>

993
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Share your beautiful say that.</v>

994
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.433
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

995
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.343
<v Speaker 1>I was sleeping with two humans and them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to humans really liked each other more </v>

996
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:33.370
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just thought it was nice that they</v>

997
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>found each other via me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they weren't,</v>

998
00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:37.183
<v Speaker 1>they were very happy together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was quite amazing because it </v>

999
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.493
<v Speaker 1>crossed over from carnality and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that sort of interests me </v>

1000
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 1>about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1001
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I've never been an overt mechanized ca </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventionally mail person.</v>

1002
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:49.074
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do enjoy the opportunity tunity for a </v>

1003
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:52.554
<v Speaker 1>kind of transcendent union that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur that there is even in the most </v>

1004
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:56.214
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous in fleeting encounter as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing that feels like love very </v>

1005
00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>much and it can't be sustained in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

1006
00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:04.490
<v Speaker 1>but you're not asking it to do that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just banding about the hybrid.</v>

1007
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm banding about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree though.</v>

1008
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:07.824
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1009
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1010
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.760
<v Speaker 1>you're just getting a hit of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

1011
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the same feeling of just as A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 1>temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1013
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of want said like the,</v>

1014
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1015
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:21.660
<v Speaker 1>why is longevity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key component?</v>

1016
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You can fall in love with someone just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a moment and that's enough.</v>

1017
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:26.160
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell writes,</v>

1018
00:47:26.161 --> 00:47:26.994
<v Speaker 1>and I quote this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the first page of homage to </v>

1019
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:29.154
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the few pages of homage to </v>

1020
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:31.054
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia that read it goes like he's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>line to sign up for Poom or some </v>

1021
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 1>anarchist group to fight in the Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>

1022
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And the bloke in front of him was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian gazer with ginger beer.</v>

1023
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And he said he loved him and he knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could love him,</v>

1024
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.063
<v Speaker 1>like just in that moment and he's never </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of saw him again because there's </v>

1025
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>something about the man that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful and you know,</v>

1026
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 1>these sort of senses of solidarity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can occur in crisis.</v>

1027
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.980
<v Speaker 1>This thing that we are looking for is </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

1028
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1029
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be nice if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I hate breakups.</v>

1030
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we do it,</v>

1031
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.250
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm imagining if there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>two week time limit,</v>

1032
00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:08.084
<v Speaker 1>so you meet someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall in love but you both go </v>

1033
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 1>microchip or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you after her weight,</v>

1034
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought it through as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with this.</v>

1035
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Speaker 1>It make someone two weeks months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks haven't like euphoric and then</v>

1036
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 1>you both know after two weeks you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>never see each other again.</v>

1037
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.303
<v Speaker 1>This is all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good because it prevents any </v>

1038
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 1>attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know to be heartbreaking if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got two weeks.</v>

1040
00:48:31.941 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 1>The one thing about like marital life or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one but one thing.</v>

1041
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the many things we might listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

1042
00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>she won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she don't care about my career,</v>

1043
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.633
<v Speaker 1>one of the many things just in case one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the many things that I like about my </v>

1044
00:48:42.261 --> 00:48:44.840
<v Speaker 1>old life is the sense and I had it this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning when I got out of bed.</v>

1045
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh please God,</v>

1046
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.143
<v Speaker 1>be going to bed with this person again </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight and I don't have to worry no </v>

1047
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:51.844
<v Speaker 1>more and hopefully this life will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuation of going to bed with this </v>

1048
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 1>person and then one of us will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

1049
00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:58.534
<v Speaker 1>At the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will building in your version yams in a </v>

1050
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 1>fortnight too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too quick.</v>

1051
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I know you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my,</v>

1052
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>my parents are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm madly in love.</v>

1053
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.580
<v Speaker 1>They'd been together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:49:07.581 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1055
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Having that model of monogamy there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1056
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:12.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like talk about their sex life all the </v>

1057
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 1>time and just you can just see it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on each other's words.</v>

1058
00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess that can happen.</v>

1059
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's given you,</v>

1060
00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.773
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you've been developed in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucible where you've been able to </v>

1061
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 1>embrace yourself outside of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly known as convention.</v>

1062
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Now what about this book you're writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds quite fascinating.</v>

1063
00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a bit more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1064
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

1065
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.793
<v Speaker 1>how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you hit deadlines and be </v>

1066
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 1>disciplined about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tricky.</v>

1067
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to write it now because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a day.</v>

1068
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.820
<v Speaker 1>What's the total 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>words a day?</v>

1069
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:52.654
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make that commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be hard for you to do it </v>

1070
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 1>while you're on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it flows out of you.</v>

1071
00:49:56.561 --> 00:50:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like typing like this and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

1072
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll be good.</v>

1073
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:04.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to write the book that you,</v>

1074
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 1>that I wish I had when I was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant about sexuality.</v>

1075
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a sort of fluid sexuality and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

1076
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And then how's it going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

1077
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to write it.</v>

1078
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.650
<v Speaker 1>You're not the pragmatic.</v>

1079
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.863
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you wish you had when you were </v>

1080
00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:18.850
<v Speaker 1>14 year old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You?</v>

1081
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess I had a unique experience </v>

1082
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:23.010
<v Speaker 1>that my parents were amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1083
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a combination of pr,</v>

1084
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing personal anecdotes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>

1085
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.950
<v Speaker 1>want to do and embarrassing anecdote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one to one do an embarrassing anecdotes.</v>

1086
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to tell this story </v>

1087
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 1>about my brother when he was a toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One underneath the.</v>

1088
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>This is not embarrassing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to volunteer people.</v>

1089
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:45.663
<v Speaker 1>We all heard about an article titled </v>
<v Speaker 1>Under the Table And my dad was like a </v>

1090
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>nudist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always naked and uh,</v>

1091
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 1>has an enormous penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father and he is sitting there and my</v>

1092
00:50:57.531 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 1>brother toddled under the table and bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the tip of my dad's Dick.</v>

1093
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

1094
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the punchline of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1095
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 1>fine one because of the story is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

1096
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.663
<v Speaker 1>So if we don't find some conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all left with the image I know to </v>

1097
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.770
<v Speaker 1>do with helping 14 year old come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with gender fluidity.</v>

1098
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:22.783
<v Speaker 1>Now so far what we've got massive willy </v>
<v Speaker 1>little profit goes onto the Typo by </v>

1099
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.333
<v Speaker 1>showed that on the Willie and we've made</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong choice with anecdotes asked </v>

1100
00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:34.630
<v Speaker 1>for an embarrassing one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was challenging.</v>

1101
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 1>That was a challenge though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1102
00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:39.410
<v Speaker 1>What the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1103
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1104
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.263
<v Speaker 1>It's the only dirt I have in my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lived the cleanest life and I </v>

1105
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.283
<v Speaker 1>remind them of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's good to keep me with your </v>

1106
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 1>property is just trying to get on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life as a professional person.</v>

1107
00:51:49.641 --> 00:51:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Here I am doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That on the tape.</v>

1108
00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:53.154
<v Speaker 1>So that's before you start judging me </v>
<v Speaker 1>for being at the vanguard of new </v>

1109
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:00.890
<v Speaker 1>identity politics and being a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>geiling and Roger in this one.</v>

1110
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:01.723
<v Speaker 1>The finger up on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never forget that day were you </v>

1111
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:05.730
<v Speaker 1>bit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all got new.</v>

1112
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Stopped bringing out when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1113
00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I've never done anything with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1114
00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:11.003
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's massive deck and the emphasis of </v>

1115
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in a sense the story didn't need.</v>

1116
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:19.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you did that,</v>

1117
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 1>which I think gave the story real sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of white.</v>

1118
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 1>He never watches this here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a brother or your dad?</v>

1119
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:27.853
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want anyone and that it was </v>

1120
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:31.570
<v Speaker 1>meant to be an embarrassing story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you may.</v>

1121
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that story?</v>

1122
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1123
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about,</v>

1124
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:36.584
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1125
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.850
<v Speaker 1>my first boyfriend was called Ian Peach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1126
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.450
<v Speaker 1>that was his real name and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1127
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.353
<v Speaker 1>he broke up with me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then years later I was doing an </v>

1128
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:47.900
<v Speaker 1>interview and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think you're gay?</v>

1129
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:48.763
<v Speaker 1>Which is tricky question and I'll also </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a lot of assumptions in that </v>

1130
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:53.384
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1131
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just panicked and said,</v>

1132
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:57.404
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe nph.</v>

1133
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.363
<v Speaker 1>But they misquote him in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They heard maybe eating a peach and so </v>

1134
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it was a bizarre and they refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>

1135
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:04.430
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you said.</v>

1136
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:05.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he page.</v>

1137
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Look here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're using the yearbook.</v>

1138
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1139
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put page,</v>

1140
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but he in a page that was half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's face it,</v>

1141
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.923
<v Speaker 1>powerful potent undertones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seemed to have been present </v>

1142
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:19.364
<v Speaker 1>throughout much of this interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally they spike into </v>

1143
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:26.651
<v Speaker 1>awareness in some ghoulish familial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image of you in an ips bed.</v>

1144
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 1>My mom has a google alert set up with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1145
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime my name comes up,</v>

1146
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.743
<v Speaker 1>she gets an email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then she got an email with that </v>

1147
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 1>interview about eating a peach was I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phone call like it's really how you</v>

1148
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 1>feel as if we gave your brother the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaches.</v>

1149
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what there was so stressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1150
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And your father must be a man that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly on the precipice,</v>

1151
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:53.180
<v Speaker 1>worrying about the tip of his John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Really off fall under the offspring,</v>

1152
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinary and magnificent person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

1154
00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's make sure that we've covered </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we need to cover.</v>

1155
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're writing that book.</v>

1156
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Can everyone please calm down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1157
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that you're definitely going to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1158
00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 1>That one's not going to be out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've got other ideas.</v>

1159
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming out and calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds quite good.</v>

1160
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be too long,</v>

1161
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but I quite like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very good at titles.</v>

1162
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>July comes out.</v>

1163
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

1164
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.273
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on tour now and we should go to </v>

1165
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:23.124
<v Speaker 1>my mind.net</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get our tickets when I'll come and </v>

1166
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 1>see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come and see you somewhere.</v>

1167
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:27.893
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're in the same place at the </v>

1168
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1169
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that'd be confusing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1170
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Be Very silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the second joke.</v>

1171
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 1>In an hour timeframe for a man calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself a professional comedian,</v>

1172
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:43.590
<v Speaker 1>charging money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero jokes.</v>

1173
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>But I've had a nice time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very beguiling and charming after</v>

1174
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:50.400
<v Speaker 1>a book signing recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person identifying as binary and I,</v>

1175
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.323
<v Speaker 1>we ran into each other in the park and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we perched on a bench together and I </v>

1176
00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain this to me.</v>

1177
00:54:55.411 --> 00:54:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Will you then as we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they explained to me,</v>

1178
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.533
<v Speaker 1>well what it is is like I don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I want to identify with either of </v>

1179
00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:04.824
<v Speaker 1>those categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an actor and now we're going to go </v>

1180
00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:09.720
<v Speaker 1>to this school and learned about acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt lucky.</v>

1181
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:10.783
<v Speaker 1>I felt sort of both old and young </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously as I reached across time </v>

1182
00:55:13.591 --> 00:55:15.690
<v Speaker 1>to this person and they explained new </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar,</v>

1183
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 1>new words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realized that the important thing,</v>

1184
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:19.374
<v Speaker 1>the thing that all of us have to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of nonjudgment and a </v>

1185
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 1>willingness to let go of our systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization because not only are they</v>

1186
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:26.724
<v Speaker 1>impeding others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably impeding ourselves and </v>

1187
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:29.064
<v Speaker 1>facilitating this bizarre tendency we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have as human beings to cast our shadow </v>

1188
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.353
<v Speaker 1>outwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's as individuals or as </v>

1189
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 1>whole societies.</v>

1190
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.113
<v Speaker 1>You see the role of many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many oppressed and persecuted groups </v>

1191
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 1>being to bear the hedge monies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to look at it's wound,</v>

1192
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.243
<v Speaker 1>the inability or the power base of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to own its own wound or </v>

1193
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.553
<v Speaker 1>currently what we would term as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia or many of the things </v>

1194
00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 1>emerging from the various forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics.</v>

1195
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel something shifting in my head</v>

1196
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:00.400
<v Speaker 1>that are kind of quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>

1197
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so good.</v>

1198
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.160
<v Speaker 1>That's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same though.</v>

1199
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's changing all the time.</v>

1200
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:05.371
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1201
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an exciting time.</v>

1202
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:07.583
<v Speaker 1>At least that's a positive thing we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think a demonstrably positive </v>

1203
00:56:11.461 --> 00:56:12.294
<v Speaker 1>thing that that these things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting and there's so much badness </v>

1204
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.074
<v Speaker 1>going on that's a really positive thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are changing their thoughts </v>

1205
00:56:19.561 --> 00:56:23.660
<v Speaker 1>on labels and identity and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're headed in the right direction then</v>

1206
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty simple thing we can sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>out as humans.</v>

1207
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.823
<v Speaker 1>You think like we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be able to do that overhead is </v>

1208
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:30.003
<v Speaker 1>making a lot of people a bit cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're are going to be </v>

1209
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 1>ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1210
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1211
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it will be very freeing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberating for a lot of people that sort</v>

1212
00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 1>of come scrambling up to you after your </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1213
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be all right.</v>

1214
00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been a really,</v>

1216
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.413
<v Speaker 1>really wonderful interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me make sure that I've done all my </v>

1217
00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 1>proper jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper jobs,</v>

1218
00:56:52.841 --> 00:56:57.841
<v Speaker 1>done proper jobs than Promo Promo Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way my is bisexual.</v>

1219
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:00.263
<v Speaker 1>That's what made my thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to reframe the way we think </v>

1220
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 1>about sexuality and refers to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Statler of scent to be 125.</v>

1221
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.413
<v Speaker 1>Don't identify as gay or straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that because that for me seems </v>

1222
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:12.910
<v Speaker 1>like the evolution of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like young people coming through,</v>

1223
00:57:12.911 --> 00:57:13.744
<v Speaker 1>they're smart and now our awakening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna accept the old ways </v>

1224
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and the old old codes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant friends in Canada who,</v>

1225
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess they're straight like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've only ever been with the opposite</v>

1226
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:24.484
<v Speaker 1>sex but they're just not going to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself that because what if I meet </v>

1227
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 1>someone tomorrow and then I have to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out like that's stressful,</v>

1228
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 1>so why not never say anything and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he never had the stress.</v>

1229
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you know much about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in affiliation with users?</v>

1230
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.183
<v Speaker 1>Is around sort of no platforming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly within academia within </v>

1231
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.404
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anything about that sort of </v>

1232
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:39.880
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

1233
00:57:39.881 --> 00:57:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I hear that phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1234
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.713
<v Speaker 1>It means like some people can't talk at </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges because I've said something in </v>

1235
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.570
<v Speaker 1>offense or something offensive often </v>
<v Speaker 1>around identity politics,</v>

1236
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know it's affected eg.</v>

1237
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine greer around gender identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Pete attachable around lgb hold on a</v>

1238
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LGBTQ issues.</v>

1239
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.473
<v Speaker 1>So if you're my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those people standard sort of </v>

1240
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 1>great civil rights giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of interesting.</v>

1241
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's no reason why you have to be.</v>

1242
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna afford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've no idea,</v>

1243
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 1>but it is so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:58:14.861 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1245
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:20.470
<v Speaker 1>With freedom of speech and then also you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1247
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:21.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to incite hatred and </v>

1248
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:26.020
<v Speaker 1>violence and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very.</v>

1249
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.970
<v Speaker 1>We're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're breaking new ground.</v>

1250
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there is a right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll do.</v>

1251
00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.513
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up to student bodies I guess to take to </v>

1252
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of discuss it amongst themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a majority.</v>

1253
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a student.</v>

1254
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to.</v>

1255
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So as university I'm just a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>student making me wait for it.</v>

1256
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:43.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm just lucky kid with a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose my learning very little </v>

1257
00:58:46.931 --> 00:58:47.764
<v Speaker 1>because I can't focus on that so as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm doing religion and global </v>

1258
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>politics and I think today or tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to a new module,</v>

1259
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:53.884
<v Speaker 1>which is the origins of Yoga in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think last year I was doing lots of </v>

1260
00:58:57.551 --> 00:58:58.750
<v Speaker 1>stuff about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

1261
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:01.030
<v Speaker 1>secularism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The role of religion,</v>

1262
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.140
<v Speaker 1>rationality versus irrationality.</v>

1263
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Beats for advent of protestantism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1264
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much stuff.</v>

1265
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 1>West fading tree in my mind is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1266
00:59:09.221 --> 00:59:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain's just brimming over with clap</v>

1267
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.690
<v Speaker 1>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good though.</v>

1268
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1269
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Toward Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up with the old bit of cleverness.</v>

1270
00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:17.884
<v Speaker 1>Just in case you in an argument one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely reach into that little </v>

1271
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 1>cupboard and knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love all that.</v>

1272
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:24.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a whole other conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm big into Joseph Campbell and </v>

1273
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good,</v>

1274
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:29.280
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1275
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to go back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could do that.</v>

1276
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you malleable kid.</v>

1277
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>You're wondering around you wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move to the country.</v>

1278
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.083
<v Speaker 1>Your family members are fighting each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other on my big frigging try to </v>

1279
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 1>university to learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>perennialism and myth,</v>

1280
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:46.844
<v Speaker 1>which I am also fascinated by because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way we have to become the hero of our </v>

1281
00:59:49.641 --> 00:59:50.080
<v Speaker 1>own lives.</v>

1282
00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.913
<v Speaker 1>It's not actually about empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence is about belief and faith and </v>

1283
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 1>becoming a sort of a journey of becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>a becoming a hero in your own existence.</v>

1284
00:59:58.611 --> 00:59:59.444
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can certainly say that you seem to </v>

<v Speaker 1>come over there and cut a little bit too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard because I'm planning to do first </v>
