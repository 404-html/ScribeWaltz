00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to this special </v>
<v Speaker 1>edition of under the skin with me </v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Russell brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr.</v>

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to him before,</v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>but this special commemorative does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a commemorative chat.</v>

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:20.691
<v Speaker 1>It's not a tea towel for the raw wedding</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Meghan markle and Prince Harry.</v>

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:21.594
<v Speaker 1>It's a to celebrate the release on paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of my book recovery and look at it </v>

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>now on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's six pound 50,</v>

8
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I think might be six pound 47 we talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that book recovery.</v>

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>We talk about the principles of recovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a road twin light meant we talk about</v>

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson's book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life is an interesting chat</v>

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.333
<v Speaker 1>talking about myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do of course go for some of the main </v>

12
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.244
<v Speaker 1>stays of Professor Peterson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Canon of ideas that he commonly talks </v>

13
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:50.784
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I think we really get to the </v>

14
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>heart of it and discover some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>some people think there's an exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of warmth.</v>

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes when talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson ideas and these,</v>

17
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:05.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm insistent on individual culpability </v>
<v Speaker 1>and responsibility.</v>

18
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We get into that stuff quite deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great chat.</v>

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.733
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who Jordan Peterson is </v>

20
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

21
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.413
<v Speaker 1>where have you been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not watching him at the </v>

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.343
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking to Jordan Peterson and </v>

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.063
<v Speaker 1>under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for joining me and do check out </v>

25
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>my book recovery on paperback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you</v>

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for coming on under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lovely to see you again.</v>

28
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 2>It's good to see you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to meet in London.</v>

29
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different isn't it?</v>

30
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of us were exiled in Los Angeles in</v>

31
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 2>our last conversation by enjoyed it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

32
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to talk to you on.</v>

33
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 2>This is very much home turf for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're in London,</v>

34
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 2>we're in a publishing office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been promoting your book,</v>

35
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I presume that's why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and doing a public couple of</v>

36
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 2>public lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you find that now?</v>

37
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 2>How do you finding what I thought in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

38
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I've been comparing you to the British </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition leader,</v>

39
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.224
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for ages and now you're </v>

40
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 2>experiencing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.824
<v Speaker 2>an almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps unprecedented level of </v>

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.603
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm assuming that your skillset is </v>

43
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 2>applicable.</v>

44
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 2>You're a lecturer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a clinical psychoanalyst,</v>

45
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

46
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 2>there's cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

47
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.513
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

48
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

49
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.123
<v Speaker 2>the large scale lectures aren't doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't that much different in kind from </v>

50
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>the lectures I was doing at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

51
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the venues are larger and yeah,</v>

52
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe,</v>

53
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 5,000</v>

54
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>at the Apollo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

55
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 2>that's where you're not nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

56
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as nervous doing that as I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>often going to talk to journalists.</v>

57
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Individual journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Because like the thing about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>venues,</v>

59
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of things about them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that worked in my favor.</v>

60
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to crowds,</v>

61
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always enjoyed lecturing and so</v>

62
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 3>lecturing to several thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't much different than lecturing to </v>

63
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 3>several hundred people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also know that the people who've </v>

64
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 3>come are there happy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>

65
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.984
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and </v>

66
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's all,</v>

67
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 3>all of the details are essentially under</v>
<v Speaker 3>my control so,</v>

68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 3>so it's not it I am actually enjoying it</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a bit.</v>

69
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

70
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 3>well because you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.933
<v Speaker 3>I want to do a good job and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure things go well and I want to </v>

72
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 3>get through the material properly and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

73
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.353
<v Speaker 3>and get a little farther in my thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I have been and I'm trying to make </v>

74
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 3>each time I lecture better than the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I don't,</v>

75
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 3>obviously I do always don't succeed at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that but,</v>

76
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm enjoying it and my wife is very good</v>

77
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 3>travel companion.</v>

78
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.173
<v Speaker 3>She's very stable and she helps me plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>my days and so we've got it down to a </v>

79
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:53.374
<v Speaker 3>bit of a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say Tammy is in the room with </v>

80
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:56.674
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already met previously in Los </v>

81
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.453
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be on mine.</v>

82
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.293
<v Speaker 3>There isn't in my back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a just in case listeners are </v>

83
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 3>wondering why perhaps they might be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to detect in my voice.</v>

84
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm occasionally glancing towards a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spouse.</v>

85
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.390
<v Speaker 3>The reason is because I am now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

86
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

87
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing these lectures,</v>

88
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's there not a performance component.</v>

89
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you not feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>

90
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

91
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lecture theater is a theater,</v>

92
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and lecture is a form of theater.</v>

93
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a serious form of theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But theater can be serious,</v>

94
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

95
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.223
<v Speaker 3>and there's a seat because partly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas to an </v>

96
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.474
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also modeling the act of </v>

97
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 3>engaging with ideas.</v>

98
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's the theatrical end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't give the same talk twice.</v>

99
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:46.984
<v Speaker 3>Like I have my stories and I have my </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection of things I know and I talk </v>

100
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try to,</v>

101
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I try to do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

102
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.783
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always talking to specific </v>

103
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 3>individuals in the audience and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a conversation with the audience.</v>

104
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.224
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the dynamic element of </v>

105
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:04.804
<v Speaker 3>the performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing I'm trying to do is </v>

106
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 3>to further my thinking on the topics </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm addressing.</v>

107
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 3>And there is a theatrical element to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because it's,</v>

108
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the closest thing really that it</v>

109
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.814
<v Speaker 3>compares to is probably stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I think the routines that </v>

110
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:20.674
<v Speaker 3>comedians have are probably more well </v>
<v Speaker 3>and formally practice than the ones </v>

111
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

112
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:26.104
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the,</v>

113
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 3>than the talks that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I engage in.</v>

114
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 3>And I don't really think of it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivering a lecture to an audience.</v>

115
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.543
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think about complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in real time with an audience </v>

116
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:42.691
<v Speaker 3>there to participate and to use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience as an indicator of whether what</v>

117
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying is gripping and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehensible.</v>

118
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 3>You apprehension and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

119
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.173
<v Speaker 3>understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adrenaline prior to going on stage </v>

120
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 3>doesn't lead you to lean into a shtick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

121
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>which would be the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're describing to remain</v>

122
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>engaged in a kind of dialectic process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of discovery.</v>

123
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Because I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I am a comedian,</v>

124
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us I would argue there is a,</v>

125
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.953
<v Speaker 1>there is a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing for before 200 people or </v>

126
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:12.764
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around 200 I feel like I'm very </v>

127
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable.</v>

128
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've got a lot of space in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

129
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like sharpen up now you've got no</v>

130
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 1>room particularly because the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial difference is I,</v>

131
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be a laugh every 2030 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

132
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>If there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets pretty frosty up there.</v>

133
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>He said it is appealing to me as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

134
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.824
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interested in furthering intellectual </v>

135
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:40.934
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at their new intersections </v>

136
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 1>between politics and spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they've always been there.</v>

137
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>These are some of these evaporating </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

138
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.593
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of new ideas perhaps best </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplified by your own particular </v>

139
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>trajectory.</v>

140
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.353
<v Speaker 1>Is it interesting to me that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces are now becoming available for </v>

141
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>forms of types of performance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't so contingent?</v>

142
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It is on rapture her an opinion or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

143
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>and I know it is a very strange thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure what to make of it.</v>

144
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see Sam Harris doing something quite</v>

145
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins is doing something quite</v>

146
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>similar and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

147
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was thinking because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to conceptualize this and,</v>

148
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.943
<v Speaker 1>and one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one comparable audience or one </v>

149
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>comparable situation is probably that of</v>
<v Speaker 1>of standup comedians.</v>

150
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.383
<v Speaker 1>Another I suspect are traveling events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even evangelical types because there </v>

151
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.823
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course what they're doing is </v>

152
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>explicitly religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

153
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.653
<v Speaker 1>This has elements of both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's emerging that's so </v>

154
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:45.374
<v Speaker 1>interesting is that there's a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>public appetite for high level </v>

155
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>intellectual conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

156
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:52.664
<v Speaker 1>if it's dynamic and I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's accounting for that all of a </v>

157
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:56.864
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because these sorts of </v>

158
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>discussions aren't taking place.</v>

159
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Like they should in the classical media </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

160
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You might be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

161
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean to slightly mangle to slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mangled the young quote that you use in </v>

162
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.120
<v Speaker 1>12 rules I'm really enjoying actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.023
<v Speaker 1>like the one could infer motivation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>results perhaps is that the political </v>

165
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.524
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social discourse has become superficial </v>

166
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>and detached from meaning from purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from experience.</v>

167
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>That there is an opening appetite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance,</v>

168
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>that people are starting to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

169
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:37.141
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

170
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>and as you said about theater before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:44.321
<v Speaker 1>the origins of theater and the origins </v>
<v Speaker 1>of religion a closely connected and both</v>

172
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:47.084
<v Speaker 1>of them still our debt or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>functionally must relate to meaning </v>

173
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving us stories that help the</v>

174
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

175
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.823
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that's there's something about </v>

176
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 3>that that's profoundly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

177
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the New York Times has recently </v>

178
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 3>written about the rise of the so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual dark web,</v>

179
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 3>which is a term that Eric Weinstein so </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly coined,</v>

180
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.014
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

181
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 3>and very thoughtfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

182
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that the thing that unites the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are loosely grouped into that</v>

183
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.504
<v Speaker 3>collection is that they are having </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious conversations with an audience </v>

184
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.694
<v Speaker 3>that they respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're very diverse range of </v>

185
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't certainly don't like salmon.</v>

186
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Sam Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree about many things,</v>

187
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

188
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.263
<v Speaker 3>but Sam respects his audiences and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's engaging them in extremely </v>

189
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:41.424
<v Speaker 3>serious discourse about very deep topics</v>
<v Speaker 3>now about the structure of reality </v>

190
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.224
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

191
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 3>and the relationship between science and</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and,</v>

192
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

193
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.133
<v Speaker 3>and I think it is a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that not only has our public </v>

194
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:55.854
<v Speaker 3>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say in the media and in politics </v>

195
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:57.834
<v Speaker 3>become shallow.</v>

196
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's become unbearably shallow </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the universities.</v>

197
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

198
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's become so ideological,</v>

199
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just not helpful.</v>

200
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:08.514
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was interviewed by a New York Times </v>

201
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:10.810
<v Speaker 3>journalists last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

202
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.993
<v Speaker 3>Nelly was her name and she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>publish this on Sunday and she did a </v>

203
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:16.284
<v Speaker 3>literature degree at Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she told me that she was quite </v>

204
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 3>appalled actually by her degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

205
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.590
<v Speaker 3>especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

206
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.513
<v Speaker 3>in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she told me that she didn't know until </v>

207
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.863
<v Speaker 3>she graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was any other way of reading </v>

208
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 3>great literature then through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern Lens.</v>

209
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 3>And the postmodern lens takes a book and</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically you take a book,</v>

210
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever it happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you decide which power hierarchy the</v>

211
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:46.941
<v Speaker 3>author was serving and who's who he's ex</v>
<v Speaker 3>or she has excluded from consideration.</v>

212
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 3>So it's completely read through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political lens as if the book is nothing</v>

213
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 3>but a tool of political and economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>domination essentially.</v>

214
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's the assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

215
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.263
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's contaminated by politics </v>

216
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 3>and power to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

217
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.363
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to art and literature except in </v>

218
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 3>service of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like group domination.</v>

219
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It's an appalling way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

220
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.783
<v Speaker 3>It would be an extraordinary bias to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring to Jane Eyre is very difficult to </v>

221
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 3>sort of make sense of it through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lens.</v>

222
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Of course you have economics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics who would like,</v>

223
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.263
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course important themes are going to </v>

224
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 3>be present in great works of art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

225
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:25.704
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

226
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm in chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still great works of art.</v>

227
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.131
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing,</v>

228
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

229
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.820
<v Speaker 3>even even with something as transient as</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

230
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

231
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 3>you can't reduce comedy to the political</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the economic and,</v>

232
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

233
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.353
<v Speaker 3>and comics who become too ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say like musicians who become </v>

234
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 3>ideal to ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not funny anymore.</v>

235
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 3>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

236
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 3>you can have your viewpoint left to </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

237
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people do,</v>

238
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 3>but you have to be able to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint continually and you have to be</v>

239
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:56.310
<v Speaker 3>able to criticize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

240
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise you're not a music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just become a demagogue of sorts.</v>

241
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would agree that once there's a rubric</v>

242
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.263
<v Speaker 3>to which you</v>

243
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>come in slave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a dogmatic then,</v>

244
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 1>then there's no room for nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for hypocrisy.</v>

245
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're transcendent mirth,</v>

246
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These forces need to be unleashed.</v>

247
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I think there's also things you can no </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer laugh about because you're,</v>

249
00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:23.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so committed to your axioms,</v>

250
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

251
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.230
<v Speaker 3>you dare not transgress against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that's deadly,</v>

252
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:29.990
<v Speaker 3>if you're a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the rule for comedy would be,</v>

253
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.350
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I like about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Sarah Silverman for example,</v>

254
00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:36.410
<v Speaker 3>is she will say anything if she thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

255
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.960
<v Speaker 3>She's very daring in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

256
00:12:38.961 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I've heard her tell jokes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.160
<v Speaker 3>really would curl your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

258
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:43.994
<v Speaker 3>but you can tell by watching or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something will pop into her head and </v>

259
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:46.814
<v Speaker 3>part of her golf chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I should say this and </v>

260
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.334
<v Speaker 3>then she'll say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's often like horribly funny and </v>

261
00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:54.200
<v Speaker 3>horribly funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good kind of funny,</v>

262
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

263
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.180
<v Speaker 3>it's daring and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's something I really admire about</v>

264
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:00.470
<v Speaker 3>comedians too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they'll,</v>

265
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>they'll take that risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

266
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.003
<v Speaker 3>and it's something also that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbing about with regards to the </v>

267
00:13:10.911 --> 00:13:11.744
<v Speaker 3>many things I find disturbing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>university campuses is that so many </v>

268
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:14.924
<v Speaker 3>comedians won't go perform on university</v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses anymore because they can't be </v>

269
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get offended and it is a false,</v>

270
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 3>so fen offended.</v>

271
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

272
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a kind of Simon says </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of,</v>

273
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like him.</v>

274
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that game in your language?</v>

275
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:32.884
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there certain things that we know </v>

276
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:34.954
<v Speaker 1>we're not allowed to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things that we know </v>

277
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of a,</v>

278
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>a kind of form you like dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a courtly behavior.</v>

279
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it referred to as that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to pay homage to a particular type</v>

280
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:50.434
<v Speaker 1>of set of protocols and manners and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily anchored to a real </v>

281
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>morality is not anchored to a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of spirit.</v>

282
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.313
<v Speaker 1>So we sense of love or kindness is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these are the rules that we abide </v>

283
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:03.454
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

284
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.653
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you a bit about the 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps and the model for handling </v>

285
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:09.244
<v Speaker 1>addiction that I've written about myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my book recovery cause I want to see </v>

286
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.860
<v Speaker 1>what you think of it a lot.</v>

287
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>So like the 12 steps have anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellowships,</v>

288
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to belong to them,</v>

289
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to say who it </v>
<v Speaker 1>belonged to them without breaching their</v>

290
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>code of anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

291
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

292
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's positive about,</v>

293
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this approach to addiction is a,</v>

294
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:31.130
<v Speaker 1>as we have discussed off Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.720
<v Speaker 1>that it creates community like the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have got a similar endeavor.</v>

296
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was young,</v>

297
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 1>the identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

298
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

299
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.183
<v Speaker 1>this solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that like people who have got </v>

300
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>chronic addiction addiction issues will </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle to change.</v>

301
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's to have a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization of some kind and the support</v>

302
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 1>of a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

303
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm the spiritual realization </v>
<v Speaker 1>component that's actually supported by</v>

304
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.813
<v Speaker 2>the relevant addiction literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the classic cures for addiction </v>

305
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:56.954
<v Speaker 2>is spiritual transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the hardcore scientists have have </v>

306
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.643
<v Speaker 2>laid that out as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a reality in the addiction </v>

307
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agree.</v>

308
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:03.884
<v Speaker 2>Because these more secular language </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that a spiritual transformation </v>

309
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:07.544
<v Speaker 2>could just be a change of perspective or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a renewal radical change of perspective </v>

310
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 2>from an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it typically,</v>

311
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from a self centered view as self</v>

312
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 2>obsessive view about getting your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs met.</v>

313
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solid cystic narcissistic perspective of</v>

314
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.474
<v Speaker 2>low life is this is just an adventure </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I go around trying to key millay </v>

315
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 2>and accrue to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>

316
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:29.564
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to be of service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's of the transition in ride </v>

317
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.433
<v Speaker 2>microscopically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in addition to a community like </v>

318
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 2>having connections between one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 12 steps themselves,</v>

319
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:43.124
<v Speaker 2>I think are an interesting model for </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation and shouldn't be </v>

320
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 2>overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

321
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.850
<v Speaker 2>what my book was about.</v>

322
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.943
<v Speaker 2>Canton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could that method be transposed to </v>

323
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's interested in change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted to talk to you about that,</v>

324
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 2>to get your perspective on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first step is acknowledging that you</v>

325
00:15:57.741 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>were powerless over your addiction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life has become unmanageable.</v>

326
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Just admitting this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be in this situation.</v>

327
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so two,</v>

328
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 2>there's two parts to that admission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A one is that you're in trouble.</v>

329
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess there's three.</v>

330
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.343
<v Speaker 2>You're in trouble and it's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things could be better and you don't </v>

331
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 2>have the wherewithal at the moment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make them better.</v>

332
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.233
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is there's a kind of radical </v>

333
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 2>humiliation and humility that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

334
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:25.784
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem and what I know at the </v>

335
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 2>moment isn't sufficient to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

336
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Because now you've opened yourself up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of learning something as</v>

337
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:34.641
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

338
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

339
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

340
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you could learn.</v>

341
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about people is that if they</v>

342
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:45.920
<v Speaker 2>decide they have a problem and they also</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed that they could learn,</v>

343
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.530
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they will learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes way up.</v>

344
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.993
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've actually conflated the first </v>

345
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:52.834
<v Speaker 2>three steps there in your analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one because the first one is </v>

346
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.883
<v Speaker 2>admission that there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second one is recognizing that </v>

347
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:00.794
<v Speaker 2>things could improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like came to believe that power greater </v>

348
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.254
<v Speaker 2>nsls could restore us to sanity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third one has made a decision to turn </v>

349
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 2>our life and our will over to the care </v>
<v Speaker 2>of God as we understood God.</v>

350
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.831
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:10.664
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about that from a secular </v>

352
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:12.951
<v Speaker 2>goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

353
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about that from a circular</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and say,</v>

354
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:16.094
<v Speaker 2>well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a higher order moral principle </v>

355
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be brought into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

356
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:20.743
<v Speaker 2>And you sort of described that right at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the question because </v>

357
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.774
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

358
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly what you do when you move from an</v>

359
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.254
<v Speaker 2>addicted state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a psychological perspective is </v>

360
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 2>moved from a viewpoint of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratification of immediate desire.</v>

361
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:34.034
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the accumulation of things as </v>

362
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 2>a marker of success to the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

363
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:39.014
<v Speaker 2>you actually have a higher purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that higher purpose might involve being </v>

364
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 2>of service that could be of service to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

365
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 2>which means you wouldn't be addicted </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

366
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's not a good way of being of </v>
<v Speaker 2>service to yourself.</v>

367
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>But I've service to yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader community.</v>

368
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 2>However you might define that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a higher order purpose and it can</v>

369
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:55.914
<v Speaker 2>integrate your motivations at at a level</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't leave you at the whim of </v>

370
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:00.594
<v Speaker 2>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the purpose of a higher order </v>

371
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

372
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>so we've got three yes.</v>

373
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:06.803
<v Speaker 2>That's the first phrase to get you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that position where you're willing to </v>

374
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the possibility of change and</v>

375
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.280
<v Speaker 2>accept help in order to achieve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

376
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 2>The fourth and fifth steps are about </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventorying.</v>

377
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Get like this is where the 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 2>program becomes a fusion of spirituality</v>

378
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.640
<v Speaker 2>and psycho analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the fourth step is a like a,</v>

379
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.493
<v Speaker 2>a four column method where you write </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a list of all your resentments in </v>

380
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>your life or childhood resentments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your resentments against the government.</v>

381
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 2>People you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you write it all down and then there's a</v>

382
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:38.751
<v Speaker 2>diagnostic tool where you identify what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is in you that doesn't like that.</v>

383
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also interestingly in,</v>

384
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 12 step,</v>

385
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theology that's call it,</v>

386
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.093
<v Speaker 2>it says that anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime that you are personally </v>

387
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 2>disturbed there is you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for it to a degree.</v>

388
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>There is something in you that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

389
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It should at least ask yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

390
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Is it me or is it the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

391
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's consider first the possibility </v>

392
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 2>that it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about that in the sixth rule,</v>

393
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your herself how say yes,</v>

394
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:08.731
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am in fact,</v>

395
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the two row like my,</v>

396
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.080
<v Speaker 2>like I did a truncated and somewhat more</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

397
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistically explicit a,</v>

398
00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 2>an explorative laden version of the 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>

399
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And I've got your 12 rules for life </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

400
00:19:22.241 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't necessarily correlate,</v>

401
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.100
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause like in instead of your first one,</v>

402
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>stand up straight with your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

403
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a great chapter I think I love about,</v>

404
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lobster staff and this sort of the </v>

405
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient,</v>

406
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.403
<v Speaker 2>timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all most roots of hierarchies and the </v>

407
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 2>chemicals that are at play.</v>

408
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.873
<v Speaker 2>What's happening when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that play when we talk about </v>

409
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:43.000
<v Speaker 2>self esteem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

410
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I like and the year the six one set your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own house in perfect order.</v>

411
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.184
<v Speaker 2>I suppose before you criticise the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>steps four and five in the tea in a 12 </v>

412
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 2>step program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with that inventory.</v>

413
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:54.780
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventory,</v>

414
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:56.990
<v Speaker 2>what your baggage is in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal think.</v>

415
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 2>It's very practical down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

416
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 2>well let's say you want to fix up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

417
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 2>which is actually quite a lot like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing yourself up,</v>

418
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 2>which is a very common dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Metaphoric attic.</v>

419
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you want to do is go </v>

420
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 2>look around and see what needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed.</v>

421
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.541
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

422
00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's the interesting thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

423
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.673
<v Speaker 2>This is a kin to what comedians too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that as soon as you're willing to </v>

424
00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 2>admit Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a problem and then rise above it</v>

425
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>right away and make a joke about it.</v>

426
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as you're willing to admit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a problem,</v>

427
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.823
<v Speaker 2>then you're immediately contacted the </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of yourself that's at least strong </v>

428
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 2>enough to admit that you have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

429
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.190
<v Speaker 2>so the act of admitting the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the first step to solving it.</v>

430
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.393
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

431
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's an optimistic step because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

432
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:41.880
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't admit to I that I have a problem</v>

433
00:20:41.881 --> 00:20:43.670
<v Speaker 2>because what if I can't solve it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

434
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then maybe you won't admit to it.</v>

435
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>If you do to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a simile.</v>

436
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.123
<v Speaker 2>Tanium admitting to the possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could solve it and then it can </v>

437
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>actually become something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic.</v>

438
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.031
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

439
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 2>my life is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

440
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing 50 things wrong.</v>

441
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.483
<v Speaker 2>Well Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could fix those things and then maybe </v>

442
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be so horrible.</v>

443
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 2>It demonstrates the admission itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrates progression and possibility</v>

444
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 2>for further progression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it relates,</v>

445
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.430
<v Speaker 2>that's why humility is always stressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

446
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 2>in great religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humility is precisely that.</v>

447
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to look at why you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so good.</v>

448
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and you know that that has to break </v>

449
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 2>down your pride to some degree in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogance.</v>

450
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:24.514
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's great because if you break </v>

451
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.194
<v Speaker 2>down your pride in your arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your prime to learn and you can </v>

452
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 2>solve your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing in that.</v>

453
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit crushing to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might think,</v>

454
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty,</v>

455
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:35.164
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things wrong with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least then you're on the on the </v>

456
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:38.644
<v Speaker 2>road to fixing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My pesonal Janay recovery has been a </v>

457
00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:42.430
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a kind of death.</v>

458
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.061
<v Speaker 2>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:43.894
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 27 it was like the death of </v>

460
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 2>the drug addict self.</v>

461
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 2>That guy dies funny because I told Tammy</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were coming here today that when</v>

462
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you were 27 you made the decision to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

463
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was 27 because that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

464
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say like cue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know celebrities who,</v>

465
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 2>who are sort of on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die all the time at 27 because they</v>

466
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 2>don't make that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided that they don't decide that</v>

467
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take that final step </v>
<v Speaker 2>into maturation.</v>

468
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.103
<v Speaker 2>They want to hold on to that Peter Pan </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that that pause you bet you </v>

469
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to hold on to that and you,</v>

470
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you can't hold onto that and live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

471
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.633
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a further death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm noticing now in my early forties so </v>

472
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:26.051
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

473
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 2>now like the midway point at the Nicoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of Dante Esquire,</v>

474
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.721
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

475
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:35.060
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm moving towards the grave and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm at like,</v>

476
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.003
<v Speaker 2>there's a different kind of alertness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and merging and back to this step four </v>

477
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 2>and 5 million in this process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventorying.</v>

478
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.830
<v Speaker 2>After you've made an imagery and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've correctly,</v>

479
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you've honestly and openly put down </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

480
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 2>incidents of child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you've said to other people,</v>

481
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.034
<v Speaker 2>things that your shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you've been willing to inscribe </v>

482
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 2>your shame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you tell another person,</v>

483
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 2>a person that you trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the original literature it says,</v>

484
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:00.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a cleric or doctor or </v>

485
00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:03.890
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It typically in a,</v>

486
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.700
<v Speaker 2>in 12 step structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a mentor figure,</v>

487
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but that has the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the role of confession,</v>

488
00:23:08.771 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>which obviously a huge part of psycho </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis.</v>

489
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.093
<v Speaker 2>The point in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this pertains to is when you </v>

490
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:14.134
<v Speaker 2>took that the dragon and the dragon that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said there was that kid's book that </v>

491
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 2>you read where it talks about the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bigger and bigger.</v>

492
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:19.504
<v Speaker 2>If it's not identified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think four and five are somewhat like </v>

493
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

494
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll end.</v>

495
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Part of the point of that kid's book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as soon as you turn around and look</v>

496
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:28.120
<v Speaker 2>at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tends to shrink.</v>

497
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.673
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a memory that you won't </v>

498
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 2>confront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

499
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 2>there's something in that memory that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying,</v>

500
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.413
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means it's sort of associated </v>

501
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 2>with everything else that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's horror.</v>

502
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:42.154
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you turn around and look </v>

503
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:44.104
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

504
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible,</v>

505
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.244
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible in this precise and </v>

506
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:48.404
<v Speaker 2>defined way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that takes it away from all the </v>

507
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:51.314
<v Speaker 2>other potential horrors of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts to shrink it right away and </v>

508
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 2>also makes you into the thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn around and look at the horror,</v>

509
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.633
<v Speaker 2>which is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real positive transformation lacked on </v>

510
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 2>your part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's true that somehow in be in being</v>

511
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:05.804
<v Speaker 2>prescriptive and being specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem becomes manageable because </v>

512
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it's limitless.</v>

513
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.820
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a apocalyptic in the end is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

514
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 2>what's the worst thing that's Kevin is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be destroyed.</v>

515
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 2>And everyone I love could be destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of itself could be destroyed.</v>

516
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And until you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

517
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:22.844
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what this is is you feel </v>

518
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 2>inadequate because you weren't role </v>
<v Speaker 2>models.</v>

519
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all right,</v>

520
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.630
<v Speaker 2>well I can maybe take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still bad,</v>

521
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's not everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

522
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.103
<v Speaker 2>you phrased that exactly right is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>without that attentive delimiting it </v>

523
00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:37.360
<v Speaker 2>becomes apocalyptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That and that,</v>

524
00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old idea.</v>

525
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

526
00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the Enuma elish is that the guards are </v>
<v Speaker 2>created there.</v>

527
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are the offspring of chaos.</v>

528
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.403
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they become very careless and they </v>

529
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 2>destroy their category system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They destroy their father essentially.</v>

530
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.573
<v Speaker 2>And chaos comes flooding back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens to people who </v>

531
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>aren't looking at things and delimiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them properly.</v>

532
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 2>They become up apocalyptic and do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mint.</v>

533
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes in a nithya there is the </v>

534
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.510
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

535
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.290
<v Speaker 2>fantech confronting of the God aeg </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prometheus's.</v>

536
00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes we need to steal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal the fire.</v>

537
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we need to challenge these </v>
<v Speaker 2>orthodoxies,</v>

538
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.110
<v Speaker 2>don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday?</v>

539
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean part,</v>

540
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:22.934
<v Speaker 2>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well part of the death that you're </v>

541
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 2>describing is actually the confrontation</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a form of tyrant.</v>

542
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Like your previously addicted self was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tyrant over your emergent self.</v>

543
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.543
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an internal tyrant and you </v>

544
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:38.300
<v Speaker 2>said it was predicated on a false value </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

545
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.223
<v Speaker 2>That's a false set of God's essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you had to confront that that is </v>

546
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:42.344
<v Speaker 2>a kind of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that some of the addiction </v>

547
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.163
<v Speaker 2>or addictive tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean as severe as chemical </v>

548
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:47.774
<v Speaker 2>dependency or forms of addiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction or a kind of self constructed </v>

549
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>formaldehyde to preserve you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of trauma,</v>

550
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 2>that trauma is acknowledged.</v>

551
00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.290
<v Speaker 2>No means to navigate trauma are present </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the isolation.</v>

552
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Because you have no mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no,</v>

553
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 2>you have no doc Trin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no community.</v>

554
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>So addiction steps in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how our preserve,</v>

555
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.050
<v Speaker 2>this is how I will not die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will find this repeat notice.</v>

556
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:14.930
<v Speaker 2>There is a habit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a repeated pattern to sustain you,</v>

557
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.070
<v Speaker 2>a holding pattern so that you don't die </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is no way out.</v>

558
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:20.590
<v Speaker 2>There's no guide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no path.</v>

559
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>You'll just in the forest and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a way out.</v>

560
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So I feel that addiction for a personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and that I,</v>

561
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.133
<v Speaker 2>I hope and suspect more broadly is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>means for sort of status for </v>

562
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>preservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After trauma,</v>

563
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.603
<v Speaker 2>the rupture occurs is not addressed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a means for survival and merges in the </v>

564
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 2>form of addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addiction is not your nemesis.</v>

565
00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:41.820
<v Speaker 2>He is your friend at least while you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.940
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whilst you're in war,</v>

567
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly a literature</v>

568
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.083
<v Speaker 3>on addiction that indicates that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people use addictive substances as a </v>

569
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:51.840
<v Speaker 3>form of self medication and they tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the drug that best,</v>

570
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 3>best medicates them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

571
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 3>and for different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different drugs.</v>

572
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

573
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.323
<v Speaker 3>Now see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the other things that I'm </v>

574
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:06.141
<v Speaker 3>proposing in my book is to use Roth </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandiose terminology is that the,</v>

575
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.823
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the template for a recovery from </v>

576
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.663
<v Speaker 3>obvious forms of addiction could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>applicable to less evident forms of </v>

577
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:17.004
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat just patterns and habits and </v>

578
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 3>because we're so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things you've laid out would be,</v>

579
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 3>would be in keeping with that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

580
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 3>you admit to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really also,</v>

581
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:27.414
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of laying out your </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentments is unbelievably useful </v>

582
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:32.124
<v Speaker 3>because that's also a way of dealing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the malevolence within you that </v>

583
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 3>might interfere with your own recovery </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're angry at yourself.</v>

584
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 3>If you're angry at your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're angry at the world,</v>

585
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.683
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the mental state that's going to </v>

586
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 3>allow you to charge deposit of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>for yourself is very,</v>

587
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:48.174
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you have a clear and authentic </v>

588
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:50.394
<v Speaker 3>relationship with your wife if you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>not correctly understood what you feel </v>

589
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:53.964
<v Speaker 3>about your own mother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you feel like that you are immeshed </v>

590
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:56.783
<v Speaker 3>or trapped in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I supposed to have an or if I've </v>

591
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 3>not understood that if I've not gained a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new perspective,</v>

592
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:02.960
<v Speaker 3>if I've not transcended it by sharing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

593
00:28:02.961 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue that in,</v>

594
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:04.984
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sleeping beauty story and the </v>

595
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:06.834
<v Speaker 3>Disney story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the prince is encapsulated in a </v>

596
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.533
<v Speaker 3>castle in the dungeon at the end and </v>
<v Speaker 3>before he goes and rescue sleeping </v>

597
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 3>beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to confront his terrible mother.</v>

598
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 3>She turns into the dragon of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

599
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 3>He has to use honesty and truth to </v>
<v Speaker 3>confront her.</v>

600
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 3>And until he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't free the maiden from her sleep.</v>

601
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's called the,</v>

602
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.093
<v Speaker 3>that's called the freeing of the anima </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the negative mother archetype and </v>

603
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 3>union psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's precisely that and that,</v>

604
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.400
<v Speaker 3>and that negative feminine will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>overlaid on your partner unless you,</v>

605
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 3>unless you're able to clarify it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>clarify your relationship with it.</v>

606
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And that could be something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>overprotection or it could,</v>

607
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your past or it could be neglect for </v>

608
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 3>that matter or it could be the rejection</v>
<v Speaker 3>at many,</v>

609
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:48.294
<v Speaker 3>at the hands of many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many women before you encountered this </v>

610
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:51.084
<v Speaker 3>woman and that then you are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring that bitterness forward as a kind </v>

611
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:54.654
<v Speaker 3>of projection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we are unwilling to undertake this </v>

612
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.503
<v Speaker 3>kind of excavation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we are doomed to continually have </v>

613
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:01.194
<v Speaker 3>relationships that are cutaneous just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the superficial coordinates will govern </v>

614
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:07.130
<v Speaker 3>our experience in pronation ships.</v>

615
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:08.703
<v Speaker 3>So that's the repetition compulsion from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Freudian perspective is that that </v>

616
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>isn't how Freud explained it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it union would explain it.</v>

617
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the simple explanation of it is,</v>

618
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bring the same set of precise,</v>

619
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 3>unexamined presuppositions to every </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

620
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:26.760
<v Speaker 3>the same fate will play out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

621
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those women are the same.</v>

622
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually no,</v>

623
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.223
<v Speaker 3>but the part of the part of them that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to make contact with acts </v>

624
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 3>the same every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different thing.</v>

625
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where six and seven the next</v>

626
00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 3>steps are chronologically occur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

627
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>there's six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having done this inventory,</v>

628
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you recognize what patterns have been at</v>
<v Speaker 2>play in your life,</v>

629
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:47.824
<v Speaker 2>which particular in the lexicon of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery defects of character of </v>

630
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>governed you often pride wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control other people's perspective,</v>

631
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 2>self pity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self centeredness,</v>

632
00:29:57.371 --> 00:29:58.720
<v Speaker 2>intolerance in patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greed,</v>

633
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.860
<v Speaker 2>jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>envy,</v>

634
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>lust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sloth.</v>

635
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.043
<v Speaker 2>That's where you identify the seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>deadly sins and how they play out in </v>

636
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 2>your life essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

637
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.903
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you become in the six step six is </v>

638
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 2>about becoming willing to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

639
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Saying I argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually willing to let go of last.</v>

640
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Are you or do you like last when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to it?</v>

641
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:19.534
<v Speaker 2>Do you like being impatient?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it serve you in some way to be </v>

642
00:30:21.971 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 2>slothful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's highly probable that it does.</v>

643
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.601
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

644
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:26.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

645
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.020
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gratifying,</v>

646
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 2>it's powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pleasurable,</v>

647
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 2>especially in the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's lots of,</v>

648
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.080
<v Speaker 2>there are reasons that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>tempted by,</v>

649
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.020
<v Speaker 2>by the seven deadly sins kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>glorious there.</v>

650
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laurie and they have a wrong,</v>

651
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.183
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a dark romantic and he really </v>

652
00:30:44.141 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 2>see that in the deaths of celebrities </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 27 is they,</v>

653
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.513
<v Speaker 2>they fall in love with the allure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of have that romantic death </v>

654
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and it does the men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Anti Libido,</v>

655
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>the dark libido,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death force.</v>

656
00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 2>So with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you have diagnosed,</v>

657
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:00.664
<v Speaker 2>which particular defects of character of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being most prominent in your path and </v>

658
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:04.624
<v Speaker 2>become willing to let go of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like at step seven is making a </v>

659
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 2>concerted and real effort to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>without them.</v>

660
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 2>And this is where it kind of becomes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice theory.</v>

661
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what are you willing to sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to move forward?</v>

662
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:18.184
<v Speaker 2>You have to give up something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and you may have to give up the </v>

663
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:21.004
<v Speaker 2>thing you love the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental sacrificial </v>

664
00:31:22.931 --> 00:31:23.764
<v Speaker 2>Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices and an unattractive idea in </v>

665
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 2>our self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

666
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 2>in our society that's based on consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and indulgence.</v>

667
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>And this is not something that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>lay,</v>

668
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.670
<v Speaker 2>this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you were,</v>

669
00:31:32.671 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 2>you and I somewhat differ is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would not,</v>

670
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 2>whilst this will not change without the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual's engagement,</v>

671
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:40.120
<v Speaker 2>a kind of step one and acknowledgement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it needs to be changed.</v>

672
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 2>This is where I say there is a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

673
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.503
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason our society has </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a manifestation of these darker </v>

674
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.300
<v Speaker 2>impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the prevalent foresees,</v>

675
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>at least in the kind of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ilumien,</v>

676
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like to live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>China or Libya.</v>

677
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.753
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what your kitchen with immediate </v>

678
00:31:58.571 --> 00:31:59.404
<v Speaker 2>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much emphasis on because immediate </v>

679
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 2>gratification is a tool of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would be my argument.</v>

680
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

681
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.820
<v Speaker 2>but at this point in the program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's where the,</v>

682
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.123
<v Speaker 2>the spirituality becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find personally undeniable that you </v>

683
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

684
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you have to call to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to in a sense,</v>

685
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:20.884
<v Speaker 2>be lay yourself open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of prayer becomes quite </v>

686
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>important now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

687
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:28.174
<v Speaker 2>there's a union idea there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the union itself is the thing that </v>

688
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 2>guides the Eagle through </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations.</v>

689
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 2>So managing the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you think you are.</v>

690
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Or the thing about the ego is the ego </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be wrong</v>

691
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.233
<v Speaker 3>and the ego can die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what that indicates is that there's </v>

692
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.163
<v Speaker 3>something underneath the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can guide that process of </v>

693
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:48.434
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And partly what you're calling on when </v>

694
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 3>you call on this higher power is at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least from a psychological perspective,</v>

695
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.963
<v Speaker 3>it's a decision to rely on that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can guide you through </v>

696
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:58.810
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

697
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Because surely as we said in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

698
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.623
<v Speaker 3>we are likely relate into a set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinates that we impose on Info </v>

699
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.163
<v Speaker 3>Commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the female,</v>

700
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.730
<v Speaker 3>the true same would be true of the cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have created,</v>

701
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 3>an impression and egoic impression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have constructed an artificial self,</v>

702
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:16.304
<v Speaker 3>but beneath it there is our higher self </v>
<v Speaker 3>or an alterior self that can often </v>

703
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:20.714
<v Speaker 3>composed of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's often composed of things that you </v>

704
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.890
<v Speaker 3>refuse to or would we're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop.</v>

705
00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And so when young talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

706
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:27.614
<v Speaker 3>the incorporation of the shadow was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've constructed a Nigo and there's </v>

707
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:31.244
<v Speaker 3>things it can do and can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's allowed to do and it isn't </v>

708
00:33:33.531 --> 00:33:34.364
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do.</v>

709
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.263
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a shadow domain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would consist of those things that you </v>

710
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:39.920
<v Speaker 3>could do but haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of that's terrible,</v>

711
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:43.900
<v Speaker 3>but some of it's what you need to break </v>
<v Speaker 3>free w uh,</v>

712
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 3>infinite variety in the shadow or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there sort of templates there?</v>

713
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

714
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:49.454
<v Speaker 3>a common component of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's last aggression aggression too </v>

715
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 3>because they're the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two that are mobilized.</v>

716
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:56.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the two that are most difficult </v>

717
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 3>to integrate into the ego because </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggression destroys and of course lost.</v>

718
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Subsumes the individual too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

719
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.243
<v Speaker 3>too well to sexual sexual desire is such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lusty zipper identified as a very </v>

720
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 3>powerful self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can,</v>

721
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.063
<v Speaker 3>it can subsume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I suppose that's why a lot of </v>

722
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.020
<v Speaker 3>theological doctrines focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of last another.</v>

723
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.831
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

724
00:34:17.831 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a disruptive force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

725
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:20.354
<v Speaker 3>because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you make a medium to longterm </v>

726
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 3>relationship with someone in knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiate that,</v>

727
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.053
<v Speaker 3>that provides you with a stable </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure that can operate across your </v>

728
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 3>entire life.</v>

729
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.860
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good for them,</v>

730
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:32.960
<v Speaker 3>it's good for your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good for society.</v>

731
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 3>But then if you're really attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone momentarily,</v>

732
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 3>you can be driven to act on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every,</v>

733
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of that can burn up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

734
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 3>And so it's no wonder that it's viewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

735
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.683
<v Speaker 3>a force of tremendous disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's also a force of tremendous </v>

736
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:48.981
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

737
00:34:48.981 --> 00:34:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to be attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

738
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 3>You want to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

739
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 3>that vital libido is part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what's driving you forward.</v>

740
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:00.320
<v Speaker 3>But hopefully it's on your side and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>working against you.</v>

741
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:01.620
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

742
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.563
<v Speaker 3>if you're successful and you've put </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself together and you're </v>

743
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:05.024
<v Speaker 3>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should still be maximally sexually </v>

744
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 3>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it should be under your control.</v>

745
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.550
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

746
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not the puppet of that force </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

747
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 3>It's integrated into you and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>much better way to manage it.</v>

748
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

749
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.310
<v Speaker 3>in your understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is the shadow incorporated?</v>

750
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.240
<v Speaker 3>What rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ceremonies,</v>

751
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 3>what behaviors successfully incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>a shadow,</v>

752
00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:27.014
<v Speaker 3>say in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using the example of lust with what's a </v>

753
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.660
<v Speaker 3>way back in for the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

754
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.120
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lust,</v>

755
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 3>there's been disembodied or repressed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a safe way for it back?</v>

756
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.003
<v Speaker 3>Is there one?</v>

757
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is to,</v>

758
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 2>is to admit to your desires within your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own relationship.</v>

759
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you might say,</v>

760
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

761
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

762
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:49.471
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

763
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:50.304
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're tired of the games that </v>

764
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you're intelligent enough to play with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife,</v>

765
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 2>but she's as plural potential as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

766
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to admit to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires,</v>

767
00:35:59.011 --> 00:35:59.844
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you have to make them </v>

768
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>consciously manifest within your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

769
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And then you know when people can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

770
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 2>people do that by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by dressing up or by,</v>

771
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.450
<v Speaker 2>by playing sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say my play exactly that play as</v>

772
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:15.570
<v Speaker 2>a transformative element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

773
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:16.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it might be that you're </v>

774
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:17.784
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable with the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your wife as sexual play thing </v>

775
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.684
<v Speaker 2>because you think that a woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>married should be proper and Prim and </v>

776
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 2>should only behave sexually in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

777
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:27.623
<v Speaker 2>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that becomes stale and dull and </v>

778
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to be tempted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>something on the outside.</v>

779
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.963
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very obvious example of how </v>

780
00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:36.024
<v Speaker 2>habitualized thinking is prohibitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>even without reaching the extremes of </v>

781
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:43.350
<v Speaker 2>self destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive tendencies.</v>

782
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:48.351
<v Speaker 2>If I have a habit of regarding my wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>as as object day,</v>

783
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.610
<v Speaker 2>even if that's not a objectification as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are typically taking,</v>

784
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting beliefs about my wife,</v>

785
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tools that break down addictive,</v>

786
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.503
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thought patterns could be used to </v>

787
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 2>create new terrains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new liberty,</v>

788
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.810
<v Speaker 2>new play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

789
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

790
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 2>so once you've done up to step seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially the steps in,</v>

791
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:08.874
<v Speaker 2>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of sacrifice of the old self </v>

792
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 2>and handing over to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of sublime divine self,</v>

793
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:14.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that step eight is you make a list </v>

794
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 2>of people that you have harmed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>become willing to make amends to them.</v>

795
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So you look back at your path and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

796
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have stolen that.</v>

797
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I treated that person badly.</v>

798
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 2>That was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lied.</v>

799
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.840
<v Speaker 2>So its moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes quite a moral monster.</v>

800
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Real repentance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

801
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:31.044
<v Speaker 2>And atonement atonement is at one meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a caring transgressions </v>

802
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that you regard as transgressions now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

803
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 2>then you don't want to carry those </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

804
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>

805
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.173
<v Speaker 2>you want to step forward in life without</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moral burden because you will have </v>

806
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:47.310
<v Speaker 2>contempt for yourself otherwise and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't take care of yourself.</v>

807
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.460
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

808
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.703
<v Speaker 2>in a sense we were talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about allowing lust backend incorporate </v>

809
00:37:53.301 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 2>in last just then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

810
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.373
<v Speaker 2>this is a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a broader method for incorporating </v>

811
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 2>annexed aspects of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

812
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you fully love,</v>

813
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>how can I fully love myself if I know I </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat it that person abominably well,</v>

814
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:11.220
<v Speaker 2>if I go back and say that was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did you wrong.</v>

815
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I owe you an amends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

816
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 2>you invite that part of your life in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you amend your path through life as well</v>

817
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:19.640
<v Speaker 2>as teaching yourself that that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we proceed any more.</v>

818
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.140
<v Speaker 2>That's their pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

819
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 2>and that's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

820
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 2>that's taking our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's real action in the world.</v>

821
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not a hypothetical at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

822
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like telling people what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've written down about your,</v>

823
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:31.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your faults.</v>

824
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

825
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Because it makes it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

826
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 2>when you're acting it out with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

827
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not only a mental thing at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

828
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore indicates step by step eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>is done separately.</v>

829
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 2>The step eight is right out the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

830
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Step nine is now going through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes the distinction,</v>

831
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I think to create a space for you where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going,</v>

832
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 2>where you're not continually thinking.</v>

833
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can do in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to apologize.</v>

834
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I was abused by them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

835
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 2>They did as much wrong as I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not the point,</v>

836
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the point.</v>

837
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.360
<v Speaker 2>And also I think we might've done more </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong than you do.</v>

838
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.233
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still stuck with the fact </v>

839
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that you did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong,</v>

840
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:04.774
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you refuse to surmount the </v>

841
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 2>obstacle over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

842
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 2>some arbitrary measure of who is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

843
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.620
<v Speaker 2>then you continue to cast yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim hood.</v>

844
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.770
<v Speaker 2>You have no personal autonomy shoes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go for it.</v>

845
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:21.043
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if you're only 5% at </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault and it also doesn't matter if the </v>

846
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:25.930
<v Speaker 2>other person apologizes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>

847
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It would be better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might make things worse.</v>

848
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Layout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the point and this perhaps is</v>

849
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:35.641
<v Speaker 2>where what I think is significant that </v>
<v Speaker 2>now your life has become not negotiation</v>

850
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 2>between you and other billy beings as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they materially present themselves,</v>

851
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.540
<v Speaker 2>but between yourself and this higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose that has been declared earlier,</v>

852
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 2>that you are now operating on the in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very calm,</v>

853
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual plane.</v>

854
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 2>You are no longer about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I do that,</v>

855
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It precisely doesn't matter if they have</v>

856
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 2>a person goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you apologize or not.</v>

857
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:53.644
<v Speaker 2>Super religious language that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed as the discovery of your </v>

858
00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:57.994
<v Speaker 2>father in heaven instead of your earthly</v>
<v Speaker 2>father because your father in heaven </v>

859
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:05.720
<v Speaker 2>would be the higher spiritual authority </v>
<v Speaker 2>to which you all allegiance.</v>

860
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about that either in </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious terms or a nonreligious terms.</v>

861
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you've done is you've in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense as you've abstracted the,</v>

862
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.883
<v Speaker 2>the idea of a higher authority and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher purpose and you've decided to </v>

863
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:19.114
<v Speaker 2>devote yourself to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a religious app and that's </v>

864
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>precisely antithetical to postmodernism </v>
<v Speaker 2>is saying that they're,</v>

865
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:25.121
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

866
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:25.451
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

867
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>There is an essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a category,</v>

868
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 2>there is a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

869
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

870
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what is precisely antithetical.</v>

871
00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.613
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the postmodern claim is that </v>

872
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 2>there are multiple ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

873
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Many ways that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the antithesis of that is yes.</v>

874
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:42.274
<v Speaker 2>Just because there's multiple ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world doesn't mean there </v>

875
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:46.280
<v Speaker 2>are multiple proper ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ways.</v>

876
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:47.163
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very narrow range of proper </v>

877
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:50.590
<v Speaker 2>ways of looking at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

878
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my concern with atheism has always been,</v>

879
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of easy affiliation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilism or why don't we just wondering,</v>

880
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that sort of like,</v>

881
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where my mind immediately goes,</v>

882
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:03.844
<v Speaker 2>if there is not an order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not just smash everything to </v>

883
00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:06.814
<v Speaker 2>smithereens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying ideologically that is </v>

884
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:11.290
<v Speaker 2>what's happening ideologically with </v>
<v Speaker 2>deconstructing God.</v>

885
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 2>We are de deconstructing morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>without for sure do gender.</v>

886
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:14.794
<v Speaker 2>We're deconstructing that was the danger</v>
<v Speaker 2>that both both nature and dusty Husky </v>

887
00:41:17.351 --> 00:41:18.190
<v Speaker 2>pointed to clearly.</v>

888
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.023
<v Speaker 2>It's like you dispense with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent principle and you open up </v>

889
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 2>the landscape for impulsive nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they responding to?</v>

890
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Post enlightenment rationalism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

891
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:29.430
<v Speaker 2>what does the Husky in nature responding</v>
<v Speaker 2>to why they run,</v>

892
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.350
<v Speaker 2>responding essentially to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the death of God,</v>

893
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 2>both of them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that explicitly.</v>

894
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 2>And he's that an enlightenment idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where is that?</v>

895
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Where he's deaf of God happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

896
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:40.783
<v Speaker 2>Should be at the hands of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a kind of arrogant and narrow </v>

897
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.580
<v Speaker 2>rationalism and the materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

898
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 2>And the exposition of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

899
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 2>the exponentially that has led us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we're going now,</v>

900
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:53.250
<v Speaker 2>which is a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

901
00:41:53.251 --> 00:41:54.084
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sort of digging the earth from </v>

902
00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:57.690
<v Speaker 2>beneath our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting ourselves into the abyss.</v>

903
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

904
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the hypothesis.</v>

905
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

906
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.253
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

907
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.450
<v Speaker 2>The last three steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Step 10 is,</v>

908
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a continue to make inventory.</v>

909
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 2>So like let this process continue like </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a day.</v>

910
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.850
<v Speaker 2>For me in psycho analytic terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a therapist obviously like,</v>

911
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 2>like it's when like when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment I know any spike in my energy.</v>

912
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 2>If I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

913
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.343
<v Speaker 2>I felt something that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt jealous there or I felt I felt </v>

914
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 2>small in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the moments I know and go,</v>

915
00:42:27.771 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was I participate in that?</v>

916
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:31.070
<v Speaker 2>What belief of mine was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged?</v>

917
00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:31.904
<v Speaker 2>Is that a helpful belief?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belief being a thought that I like </v>

918
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 2>having an 11 right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a kind of consciousness is like,</v>

919
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:39.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fall apart.</v>

920
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:42.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make mistakes.</v>

921
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:42.914
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep an eye out for when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do make mistakes and I'm going to make </v>

922
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 2>them conscious and then I'm going to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>and work on them.</v>

923
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.103
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bringing them into into consciousness </v>

924
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:52.410
<v Speaker 2>cause my fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my number one thing on a personal level,</v>

925
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 2>possibly on a social level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know quite how to extrapolate or</v>

926
00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:58.430
<v Speaker 2>conflate those two notions is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness.</v>

927
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I've get very afraid when I'm dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with unconscious individuals.</v>

928
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:02.474
<v Speaker 2>When Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>

929
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>people don't know why they're doing what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

930
00:43:04.941 --> 00:43:05.774
<v Speaker 2>You may see this in sort of violent rage</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even in less dramatic or theatrical </v>

931
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:10.934
<v Speaker 2>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel there's a great idea that </v>

932
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.083
<v Speaker 2>lurks at the bottom of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological tradition is that a little </v>

933
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:21.080
<v Speaker 2>bit of consciousness destroyed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original paradise.</v>

934
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>We became conscious enough to be aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our own mortality.</v>

935
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 2>But the cure for that is way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

936
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.480
<v Speaker 2>not a return to unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

937
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no going back.</v>

938
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies is,</v>

939
00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know they're already dead.</v>

940
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so like that danger of the Zombie </v>

941
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 2>is the danger of the desire for </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness as a,</v>

942
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 2>as a solution to life's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that this is again,</v>

943
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:45.674
<v Speaker 2>something we're being invited to </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in through consumerism that </v>

944
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:51.560
<v Speaker 2>live your life continually on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency of unconscious energy,</v>

945
00:43:51.561 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 2>such as desire and fear that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

946
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:56.780
<v Speaker 2>we're not being invited to participate </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their level of consciousness,</v>

947
00:43:56.781 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>conscious interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence in the moment.</v>

948
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.743
<v Speaker 2>While you could make that case if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made the case that consumerism promotes </v>

949
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 2>the gratification of immediate desires </v>
<v Speaker 2>above all else.</v>

950
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>

951
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm pushing forward with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this original sin like,</v>

952
00:44:11.571 --> 00:44:13.130
<v Speaker 2>so a little bit of consciousness is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous thing.</v>

953
00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 2>We've become aware of our vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mortality,</v>

954
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:17.600
<v Speaker 2>our nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporeal nature.</v>

955
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>But the solution to this is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become more conscious to,</v>

956
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.640
<v Speaker 2>we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

957
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

958
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.253
<v Speaker 2>how was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have the whole rest of the </v>

959
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

960
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.653
<v Speaker 2>Grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does that get resolved now when </v>

961
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>they get kicked out of the garden?</v>

962
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what happens in,</v>

963
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:35.874
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the redemptive story is if you think </v>

964
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:39.114
<v Speaker 3>about Christ as a symbolic figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say a symbolic of the process of </v>

965
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 3>transformation that we just described is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

966
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.473
<v Speaker 3>one of the morals of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>passion is that you need to radically </v>

967
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:49.854
<v Speaker 3>accept your limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of this keeping your sins </v>

968
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:54.840
<v Speaker 3>before your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you just described,</v>

969
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 3>here's all the ways that I fall short of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glory of God.</v>

970
00:44:57.751 --> 00:44:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

971
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I make this mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make this mistake,</v>

972
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 3>I made this mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all consciousness.</v>

973
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

974
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

975
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.673
<v Speaker 3>you become more conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this glorious process of </v>

976
00:45:09.661 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And overall it is.</v>

977
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:12.114
<v Speaker 3>But the details are exactly this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The things you need to become </v>

978
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious of our precisely,</v>

979
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 3>those things that you least want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become conscious of.</v>

980
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.310
<v Speaker 3>And that this is the Motif that you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>identified in the alchemical tradition,</v>

981
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 3>because the whole chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chemical motto,</v>

982
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:27.743
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that which you most need to be </v>

983
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 3>found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that which you most need to find will be</v>

984
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 3>found where you least want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

985
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone knows that's true.</v>

986
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Like you tell someone that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

987
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

988
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:39.871
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

989
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I know that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

990
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 3>and that's also the greatest barrier to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment,</v>

991
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:45.930
<v Speaker 3>because if a night moon was all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 3>tulips and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sunshine,</v>

993
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 3>then everyone would be enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not.</v>

994
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 3>It's this continual bringing before </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

995
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Speaker 3>all your proclivity for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for transgression.</v>

996
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.653
<v Speaker 3>And that's that and that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>because how are you going to solve your </v>

997
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:01.550
<v Speaker 3>problems if you're not aware of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

998
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all discipline today,</v>

999
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1000
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 3>it's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the alternative is far worse.</v>

1001
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing and that is the display</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was very curious.</v>

1002
00:46:12.361 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I was very curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

1003
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I talked about this with Tammy when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were coming here.</v>

1004
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I thought Russell decided to live when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 27 I can't.</v>

1005
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why did you make the decision to,</v>

1006
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 3>to not allow what was consuming you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill you?</v>

1007
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:29.223
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taken out of my hands for the </v>

1008
00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:31.894
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I encountered positive of male or 40 </v>

1009
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.340
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiously like,</v>

1010
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:39.370
<v Speaker 1>or at least that we're able to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in particular,</v>

1011
00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I was sent to a treatment center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had free months.</v>

1012
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I had time to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had time to let I,</v>

1013
00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I passed from childhood directly into </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictive behaviors.</v>

1014
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:50.974
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those addictive behaviors are already </v>

1015
00:46:51.701 --> 00:46:54.680
<v Speaker 1>present in childhood in a less toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>form in a,</v>

1016
00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:56.110
<v Speaker 1>my relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In retrospect,</v>

1017
00:46:56.111 --> 00:46:58.360
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate was addictive.</v>

1018
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.910
<v Speaker 1>My relationship with pornography as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent addictive,</v>

1019
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I was using it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for medical medical purposes.</v>

1020
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:06.483
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when substances became an option in </v>

1021
00:47:09.281 --> 00:47:11.350
<v Speaker 1>adolescents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was seamless.</v>

1022
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that my emotional and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my emotional growth was arrested at that</v>

1023
00:47:16.511 --> 00:47:18.610
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I was able to stop is because</v>

1024
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.560
<v Speaker 1>inadvertent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was offered help.</v>

1025
00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:21.423
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was given help our people that the </v>

1026
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.590
<v Speaker 1>management company that was working with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cf of drug addicts,</v>

1027
00:47:26.591 --> 00:47:27.550
<v Speaker 1>you should go away.</v>

1028
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:28.523
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So partly that meant that re they </v>

1029
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 3>regarded</v>

1030
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you as the sort of valuable commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was worth preserving.</v>

1031
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a degree of that,</v>

1032
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1033
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's helpful.</v>

1034
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>

1035
00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 1>so even if it's purely an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

1036
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's something to that.</v>

1037
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so then you went into treatment </v>

1038
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and you found some people that I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was run by an atheist,</v>

1039
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.200
<v Speaker 1>a chip Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 12 step principles,</v>

1040
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't unpick it from the Oxford </v>
<v Speaker 1>Group.</v>

1041
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 1>First Century Christian group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1042
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1043
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's more appealing when you talk</v>

1044
00:47:58.181 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 1>about it in Uni in terms of though I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no problem with the sublime and the</v>

1045
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 1>divine live for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1046
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 1>like I was always trying to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my head off my face.</v>

1047
00:48:06.311 --> 00:48:07.144
<v Speaker 1>Those were the things I wanted a sublime</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and experience of what is </v>

1048
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 1>beyond the material.</v>

1049
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it was,</v>

1050
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:14.703
<v Speaker 1>but once I was in that environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like given drugs to help where I was </v>

1051
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>addicted to opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I recommend a drug called subutex Dan</v>

1052
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 1>and sleeping pills because I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

1053
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.443
<v Speaker 1>And during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in a way I didn't fully </v>

1054
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 1>address the issue of addiction because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1055
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I was really promiscuous for about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade that I,</v>

1056
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:35.803
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that behavior was transplant it kind of </v>

1057
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:38.884
<v Speaker 1>effortlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do remember a kind of moment of </v>

1058
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.153
<v Speaker 1>epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epiphany is revelation of previously </v>

1059
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:47.410
<v Speaker 1>concealed truth when it first occurred </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1060
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:48.283
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you don't have to take drugs </v>

1061
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:50.434
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that thought entering and it </v>

1062
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.110
<v Speaker 1>being sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1063
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd never thought about that cause that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

1064
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd found a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked in,</v>

1065
00:48:58.181 --> 00:48:59.014
<v Speaker 1>worked as a way of managing pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent in forever mental investigation </v>

1066
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:04.174
<v Speaker 1>or discovery of conclusions that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been unhelpful and that wouldn't </v>

1067
00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 1>have been able to deal with.</v>

1068
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I think in a lot of cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure there's many,</v>

1069
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 1>many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1070
00:49:11.261 --> 00:49:11.981
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1071
00:49:11.981 --> 00:49:12.814
<v Speaker 1>that actually chemical dependency as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful technique for preventing </v>

1072
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.720
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there is just,</v>

1073
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a holding pattern to stop me </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something more dramatic and band,</v>

1074
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 1>unless people have access to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

1075
00:49:26.561 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 1>a structure and support that will help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them through that.</v>

1076
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to overcome.</v>

1077
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:31.864
<v Speaker 1>And I was fortunate in that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted that and then granted this </v>

1078
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:35.890
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1079
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:36.724
<v Speaker 1>and as I've been working in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come to the conclusion that it is </v>

1080
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.283
<v Speaker 1>possibly universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I think it's derived from </v>

1081
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:48.090
<v Speaker 1>universal ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think young I made that,</v>

1082
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 1>that identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1083
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some,</v>

1084
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 1>like if there's a spiritual experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the support for community,</v>

1085
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 1>that's how someone could be stopped from</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking continually alcoholic drinking.</v>

1086
00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.433
<v Speaker 1>And then they took this process where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 12th original 12 step fellowships </v>

1087
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:08.130
<v Speaker 1>took the Oxford group had a program of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of redemption and restitution and,</v>

1088
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.313
<v Speaker 1>and like it seems initially in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a materialistic society </v>

1089
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:15.634
<v Speaker 1>counter intuitive to think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to addiction is going to be </v>

1090
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.160
<v Speaker 1>super spiritual awakening.</v>

1091
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1092
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the final steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stay connected once you wrote,</v>

1093
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 1>like you're continually inventorying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment we think,</v>

1094
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt something there.</v>

1095
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you want to be in the moment </v>

1096
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1097
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.833
<v Speaker 1>and I have to know is if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone makes me feel inferior or if </v>

1098
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm sexually attracted to someone,</v>

1099
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:40.664
<v Speaker 1>those are the most obvious examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will take me out of my </v>

1100
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 1>connection and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final step is,</v>

1101
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it,</v>

1102
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1103
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 1>help others and remain awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1104
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the end of the hero's </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey is once you go into the darkness</v>

1105
00:50:56.711 --> 00:50:59.550
<v Speaker 3>and find something of value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next thing to do is to distributed,</v>

1106
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.860
<v Speaker 3>distributed within the community to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it back and distributed within the</v>

1107
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:04.500
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1108
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:05.643
<v Speaker 1>Now told and D is it like it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for me to accept that you've </v>

1109
00:51:09.101 --> 00:51:14.101
<v Speaker 1>not been a sort of personally affected </v>
<v Speaker 1>and are not personally angry rather than</v>

1110
00:51:14.501 --> 00:51:15.640
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1111
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.853
<v Speaker 1>objectively because your personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory I suppose in the public eye </v>

1112
00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:21.094
<v Speaker 1>at least began with the situation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada with a sort of forced speech or </v>

1113
00:51:25.781 --> 00:51:28.210
<v Speaker 1>however it's termed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1114
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.060
<v Speaker 1>so like that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you able to distinguish between your</v>

1115
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sort of sense of personal irritation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1116
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for most people,</v>

1117
00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:35.194
<v Speaker 1>and tell me what were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think that he's </v>

1118
00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:38.080
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that academia seems like,</v>

1119
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1120
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.653
<v Speaker 1>an ancillary area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem mainstream to most </v>

1121
00:51:43.841 --> 00:51:44.720
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1122
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but to you it seems as though it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1123
00:51:46.071 --> 00:51:47.950
<v Speaker 1>very vital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are an academic.</v>

1124
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:48.851
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1126
00:51:48.851 --> 00:51:50.380
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two things there.</v>

1127
00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean people regard academia as </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancillary,</v>

1128
00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.203
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as because the universities </v>

1129
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.173
<v Speaker 3>train the people who run things and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever's mainstream in the </v>

1130
00:52:04.511 --> 00:52:08.080
<v Speaker 3>universities right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's separate from society,</v>

1131
00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 3>is going to be mainstream everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years down the road.</v>

1132
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:13.203
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big brawl against the vanguard </v>

1133
00:52:14.681 --> 00:52:16.020
<v Speaker 3>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1134
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.540
<v Speaker 1>do you think what's happening now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of a media and politics?</v>

1135
00:52:19.541 --> 00:52:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1136
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.973
<v Speaker 1>could say you could preemptively if </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed that from what's happening </v>

1137
00:52:23.111 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years?</v>

1138
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1139
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1140
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:25.904
<v Speaker 3>I think that in some sense I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>preemptively diagnosing it because I've </v>

1141
00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>been watching the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern types for quite a long time.</v>

1142
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:34.634
<v Speaker 3>And one of the C,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I noticed about five </v>

1143
00:52:36.831 --> 00:52:38.000
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years ago,</v>

1144
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 3>there were two things that I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I really didn't like.</v>

1145
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 3>The first is that because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality psychologist,</v>

1146
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.430
<v Speaker 3>as a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as a clinician,</v>

1147
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 3>but as a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1148
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.183
<v Speaker 3>I know the literature on gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality because it's </v>

1149
00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.334
<v Speaker 3>part of my field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I could tell that I was starting to </v>

1150
00:52:56.121 --> 00:53:00.080
<v Speaker 3>have some reluctance to deliver the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture on gender differences.</v>

1151
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.170
<v Speaker 3>And now I didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1152
00:53:02.171 --> 00:53:03.004
<v Speaker 3>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt that I was treading on thin ice </v>

1153
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 3>by delivering those lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

1154
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:09.224
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good because I'm like a </v>

1155
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:11.654
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty much willing to say anything </v>

1156
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:15.320
<v Speaker 3>that I think is true and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1157
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.420
<v Speaker 3>regardless of the consequences in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

1158
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:19.700
<v Speaker 3>because I'd rather take the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's true.</v>

1159
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And I thought this isn't good because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like me who's,</v>

1160
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

1161
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncontrollably mouthy,</v>

1162
00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's starting to have second </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about teaching,</v>

1163
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:31.320
<v Speaker 3>what's a very serious topic and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1164
00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 3>and something about which there's a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>well developed science then how much are</v>

1165
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 3>other people starting to censor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time,</v>

1166
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 3>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of whom were female,</v>

1167
00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.573
<v Speaker 3>were telling me that they were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hesitant to talk about gender </v>

1168
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 3>differences in any of the courses they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were running.</v>

1169
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.241
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1170
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 3>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is seriously not good.</v>

1171
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly the case that,</v>

1172
00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.513
<v Speaker 3>that my colleagues censor themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly on campus with regards to </v>

1173
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 3>the topics they're willing to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's subtle,</v>

1174
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:01.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because imagine in a given lecture I </v>

1175
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 3>could discuss any of 10 things and three</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them are taboo.</v>

1176
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just won't discuss those,</v>

1177
00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1178
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a kind of invisible censorship.</v>

1179
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I'll get up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1180
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I could have talked to you about gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality,</v>

1181
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:20.574
<v Speaker 3>but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick another topic because there's lots </v>

1182
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:24.834
<v Speaker 3>of topics to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means there's going to be a </v>

1183
00:54:27.091 --> 00:54:27.924
<v Speaker 3>bunch of topics that are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important because actually the issue of </v>

1184
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:31.254
<v Speaker 3>sex differences in personality happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be really important that people just </v>

1185
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.304
<v Speaker 3>won't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that's so annoying </v>

1186
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:38.274
<v Speaker 3>about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with regards to sex </v>

1187
00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1188
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that you're firmly on the side</v>

1189
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 3>of women just for the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1190
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.920
<v Speaker 3>you admit to or deny the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex differences in personality.</v>

1191
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 3>What's better for women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1192
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical left is basically say,</v>

1193
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:59.580
<v Speaker 3>oh well those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you talk about sex differences,</v>

1194
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.414
<v Speaker 3>then you're part of the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy and you're attributing to </v>

1195
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 3>women a different kind of temperament in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempt to continue the suppression.</v>

1196
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.990
<v Speaker 3>But I could just as easily say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1197
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>

1198
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to,</v>

1199
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.713
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give the individual the greatest degree </v>

1200
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:18.150
<v Speaker 3>of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1201
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1202
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:20.423
<v Speaker 3>you're different from another person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're different on the basis of a </v>

1203
00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:25.860
<v Speaker 3>variety of your characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex being one of them,</v>

1204
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 3>that's going to have some effect on what</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of choices you want to make in your</v>

1205
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:30.624
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like go ahead and make whatever </v>

1206
00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 3>choices you want as far as their direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression of your being.</v>

1207
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.570
<v Speaker 3>And so if you deny the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these sex differences,</v>

1208
00:55:39.571 --> 00:55:40.404
<v Speaker 3>which no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no serious commentator in the </v>

1209
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 3>psychological literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the personality domain,</v>

1210
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:47.670
<v Speaker 3>and those are the people to know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing,</v>

1211
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 3>nobody debates whether or not sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in personality exist or that</v>

1212
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 3>they have a biological component.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1213
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:55.914
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's also interesting about that </v>

1214
00:55:57.541 --> 00:56:00.420
<v Speaker 3>is that none of those people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>

1215
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:01.703
<v Speaker 3>There are no conservative psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers to speak of there in a tiny </v>

1216
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:06.984
<v Speaker 3>minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people that have done the </v>

1217
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.264
<v Speaker 3>research indicating that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between the sexes and </v>

1218
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:13.314
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that those differences have a </v>

1219
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 3>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in part a biological component.</v>

1220
00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:18.803
<v Speaker 3>Those are liberal and left leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who've drawn those conclusions </v>

1221
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.230
<v Speaker 3>despite their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1222
00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:24.064
<v Speaker 3>despite what their ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions might have suggested to </v>

1223
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:28.330
<v Speaker 3>them to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1224
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1225
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:31.503
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say about that </v>

1226
00:56:32.531 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 3>except that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all appalling.</v>

1227
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.393
<v Speaker 3>I suppose the fear must be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference will ultimately be used for </v>

1228
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 3>leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for status that sure,</v>

1229
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a reasonable fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1230
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 3>because because anything can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulated but,</v>

1231
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.120
<v Speaker 3>but claims of identity can have identity</v>
<v Speaker 3>claims that,</v>

1232
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:58.690
<v Speaker 3>that people are identical in some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>can also be used for the same reason.</v>

1233
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I insist that everyone is exactly the</v>

1234
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:03.454
<v Speaker 3>same on all dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's just as much of a </v>

1235
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:05.884
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian threat lurking in there as </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is the threat lurking that we'll </v>

1236
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:10.570
<v Speaker 3>use differences as an excuse.</v>

1237
00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:11.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're also not having a serious </v>

1238
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 3>discussion about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1239
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are men are overrepresented at the</v>

1240
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:19.660
<v Speaker 3>top of the economic apex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1241
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a small minority of men by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not men in general,</v>

1242
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 3>but they're radically underrepresented </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the board,</v>

1243
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>overrepresented at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And believe me man,</v>

1244
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:32.260
<v Speaker 3>like nobody cares about men who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>failures.</v>

1245
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.800
<v Speaker 3>They are like off the bloody radar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:35.683
<v Speaker 3>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no sympathy for men who are </v>

1247
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:37.924
<v Speaker 3>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So men stock up at the top and the </v>

1248
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 3>bottom and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1249
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.333
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have a discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and we don't have a discussion </v>

1250
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:49.360
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that women are radically </v>
<v Speaker 3>underrepresented in dangerous jobs,</v>

1251
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.253
<v Speaker 3>although they are or in or in or in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in trades that require like brutal </v>

1252
00:57:56.111 --> 00:57:56.944
<v Speaker 3>physical labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women are radically underrepresented </v>

1253
00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.733
<v Speaker 3>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orange jobs outside women are radically </v>

1254
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:04.840
<v Speaker 3>underrepresented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the complaint is always,</v>

1255
00:58:04.841 --> 00:58:07.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the top 1%,</v>

1256
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 3>it's there are more men than there </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>

1257
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by pure sex division.</v>

1258
00:58:11.981 --> 00:58:12.461
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1259
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the bottom,</v>

1260
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.913
<v Speaker 3>the reverse is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we're going to have the </v>

1261
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

1262
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 3>and I don't really necessarily think we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have that discussion,</v>

1263
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 3>but if we're going to have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>

1264
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 3>then we should look across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic spectrum.</v>

1265
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of this debate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being governed by unconscious forces.</v>

1266
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing is a manifestation of,</v>

1267
00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:37.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1268
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.810
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1269
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:44.070
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cartography has not yet been a lot</v>

1270
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:44.913
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you thinking about any </v>

1271
00:58:45.971 --> 00:58:47.980
<v Speaker 1>particular part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1272
00:58:47.981 --> 00:58:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel like is that the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice,</v>

1273
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:52.694
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you are arguments that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on research are so successful is </v>

1274
00:58:55.781 --> 00:58:56.614
<v Speaker 1>because people are expressing feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to cogent and researched </v>

1275
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:07.180
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like corvair is a powerful,</v>

1276
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.073
<v Speaker 1>dominant patriarchy and no one can deny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that there is power there such a </v>

1277
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:13.264
<v Speaker 1>thing as power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are people that benefit from </v>

1278
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 1>structures being as they are of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1279
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 1>The point of those structures being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they are.</v>

1280
00:59:20.351 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've observed is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever change is discussed,</v>

1281
00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my tendency has always been to be </v>

1282
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:30.194
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic towards movements that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>about change or empowerment of what </v>

1283
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 1>might be termed disadvantaged groups.</v>

1284
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:38.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes or the that when you're </v>

1285
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:42.163
<v Speaker 1>curious about the resistance of change </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the different difficulties that you </v>

1286
00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:45.074
<v Speaker 1>face when trying to bring about change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at who would be negatively </v>

1287
00:59:47.481 --> 00:59:49.850
<v Speaker 1>impacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that change to be bought about.</v>

1288
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And usually that means that there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for vote.</v>

1289
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism makes sense to a particular</v>

1290
00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:56.774
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I felt when I'm </v>

1291
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 1>reading a book was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1293
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.973
<v Speaker 1>because I think you're coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of psycho analysis and it </v>

1294
01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>rings very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language rings true and the analysis</v>

1295
01:00:09.591 --> 01:00:10.424
<v Speaker 1>rings true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Wa where I feel one question that I </v>

1296
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:15.614
<v Speaker 1>was keen to bring to you because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked about skateboarders in the </v>

1297
01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.053
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the last bit one chapter </v>

1298
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>and that spirit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young people.</v>

1299
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:25.004
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courage and a willingness to try </v>

1300
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things and to push forward.</v>

1301
01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:29.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how that sits with the idea of </v>

1302
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an earlier passage in the book where you</v>

1303
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>talk about the gratitude that we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel for,</v>

1304
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:38.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having time to read a book and the </v>

1305
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:39.884
<v Speaker 1>ability to read a book and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect for the establishment and </v>

1306
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>systems that have been set up from which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all benefit in it.</v>

1307
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1308
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:48.614
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could find it difficult to dispute </v>

1309
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>your opinion about sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists.</v>

1310
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>What would have been in the lexicon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day socially social justice warriors</v>

1311
01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:04.001
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of some what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rootless unresearched rage.</v>

1312
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.203
<v Speaker 1>Like I identify what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that can't keep their </v>

1313
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:09.374
<v Speaker 1>bedrooms tidy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have be careful before you let them </v>

1314
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>organize an economic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1315
01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:15.423
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but similarly like in where is change </v>

1316
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>going to come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are,</v>

1317
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>who is going to challenge tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Is it kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1319
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:23.843
<v Speaker 3>Those are the sorts of of twin forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have to contend with across the </v>

1320
01:01:26.731 --> 01:01:29.760
<v Speaker 3>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I could run through something quickly</v>

1321
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.670
<v Speaker 3>to put the things that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just brought up in,</v>

1322
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.380
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in perspective,</v>

1323
01:01:34.381 --> 01:01:35.101
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1324
01:01:35.101 --> 01:01:38.940
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that hierarchies,</v>

1325
01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:41.940
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to value some things </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than others,</v>

1326
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:43.583
<v Speaker 3>then hierarchies are inevitable and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to value some things more than </v>

1327
01:01:46.681 --> 01:01:49.710
<v Speaker 3>others or you don't have anything going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a or strength for something.</v>

1328
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.410
<v Speaker 3>What core competence or sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1329
01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Whenever it happens to be the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>play the flute,</v>

1330
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1331
01:01:56.941 --> 01:01:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Why on my list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1332
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.083
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you know?</v>

1333
01:01:59.100 --> 01:01:59.933
<v Speaker 3>Obviously if you value music then you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to value some musicians more than </v>

1334
01:02:02.851 --> 01:02:04.610
<v Speaker 3>others because some are better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as,</v>

1335
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.920
<v Speaker 3>and so you have to value things in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move forward in life.</v>

1336
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.100
<v Speaker 3>And you have to value things in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have something valuable to produce.</v>

1337
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:13.740
<v Speaker 3>But if you play out the value and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social landscape,</v>

1338
01:02:13.741 --> 01:02:14.574
<v Speaker 3>you're going to produce a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with producing a </v>

1339
01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:17.334
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy is that a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to be successful than </v>

1340
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 3>the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a very large number of people aren't</v>

1341
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 3>going to be successful at all at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that particular thing.</v>

1342
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 3>It's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1343
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:27.683
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1344
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.850
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you wanna say while we have to put up</v>

1345
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:30.684
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we need to pursue things of </v>

1346
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1347
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:33.864
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the right wing perspective is </v>

1348
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 3>that the hierarchy's are justifiable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>

1349
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Now the left wing perspective is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1350
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:40.704
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with hierarchies is that </v>

1351
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 3>people stock up at the bottom and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they tilt towards tyranny across time.</v>

1352
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.483
<v Speaker 3>And that's also true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you need that dialectic in </v>

1353
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 3>society between the right wing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1354
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:52.943
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need the hierarchies and they're </v>

1355
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 3>useful and you should be grateful for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they structure you and give you</v>

1356
01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 3>form and provide value.</v>

1357
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 3>And the left that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1358
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:05.130
<v Speaker 3>but they exclude people and people stack</v>
<v Speaker 3>up at the bottom and that's dangerous to</v>

1359
01:03:05.131 --> 01:03:05.964
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy itself and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that people might not have </v>

1360
01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and you have to say yes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1361
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.250
<v Speaker 3>The problem comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the situation we're in right</v>

1362
01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:19.251
<v Speaker 3>now where the radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is mostly a problem that really</v>

1363
01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>permeates the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The radical left is say,</v>

1364
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.153
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all hierarchies are just tyrannical </v>

1365
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:25.434
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1366
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

1367
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:27.923
<v Speaker 3>Hierarchies are based on competence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it functioning society and mostly our </v>

1368
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:33.450
<v Speaker 3>society functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need it.</v>

1369
01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.293
<v Speaker 3>You can't go that far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean that the </v>

1370
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy's don't tilt towards self </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest and tyranny across time,</v>

1371
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:42.924
<v Speaker 3>but that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even a bad thing from the </v>

1372
01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:49.551
<v Speaker 3>conservative perspective so well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's room for the left,</v>

1373
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 3>there's room for the left because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor will always be with us.</v>

1374
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.063
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason that there's room for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and that the dispossessed need </v>

1375
01:03:58.461 --> 01:03:59.294
<v Speaker 3>a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not least because there are talented </v>

1376
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 3>people among the dispossessed and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stuck at zero,</v>

1377
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 3>everyone suffers because we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to their talents.</v>

1378
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.930
<v Speaker 3>It's bad use of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the right it's like,</v>

1379
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:11.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need the damn value.</v>

1380
01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:12.444
<v Speaker 3>Hark is we need to be grateful for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions and our structures because </v>

1381
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:15.803
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stop us from degenerating into </v>

1382
01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:17.840
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

1383
01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.673
<v Speaker 1>Also across the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous hierarchies emerge and at some </v>

1384
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>point decisions are being made about </v>
<v Speaker 1>which thing,</v>

1385
01:04:24.401 --> 01:04:24.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

1386
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:25.734
<v Speaker 1>It being a brilliant flutist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning </v>

1387
01:04:29.591 --> 01:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>land or controlling energy resources or </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate in financial systems,</v>

1388
01:04:34.361 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>which are the hierarchies that are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1389
01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1390
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like it's the way that resources</v>

1391
01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>are designated and challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those hierarchies seems to become,</v>

1392
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>well almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1393
01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>when I was leaving the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brilliant hospital,</v>

1394
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>they've been taking care of my mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1395
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of like,</v>

1396
01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:01.544
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of crisis and trauma and </v>

1397
01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>tragedy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

1398
01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>They've got this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Best doctors,</v>

1399
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that guy might in griffith that operated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her bowel.</v>

1400
01:05:10.181 --> 01:05:11.014
<v Speaker 1>He's like a fantastic surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is in fact him that trump was quote </v>

1401
01:05:14.431 --> 01:05:15.264
<v Speaker 1>in when he talks about European </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals with blood spattered from </v>

1402
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>knife crime.</v>

1403
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a sort of a mangling of a quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1404
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>that this might in griffith a given and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of like,</v>

1405
01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:23.734
<v Speaker 1>I step outside like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving along along white chapel </v>

1406
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>road and there are um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic advertising boards and it,</v>

1407
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:31.571
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:33.060
<v Speaker 1>that require energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So tell me to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1410
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:35.134
<v Speaker 1>sort of a McDonald's or kit kats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and there's so much poverty on </v>

1411
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:39.874
<v Speaker 1>that street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There always has been in that part of </v>

1412
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>east London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible poverty.</v>

1413
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:43.504
<v Speaker 1>And I feel it was moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are moments when I helicopter out </v>

1414
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>to the macro a perspective that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual can long hold or wait.</v>

1415
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>That can't be long born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in that moment I think,</v>

1416
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.753
<v Speaker 1>why is this hospital struggling for </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources when we can afford to run </v>

1417
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.013
<v Speaker 1>electronic adverts for Mcdonald's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets to decide how collectively and </v>

1418
01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:08.764
<v Speaker 1>individually do we determine where </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and where power both in terms </v>

1419
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 1>of energy but also in terms of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and up.</v>

1420
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>How were these decisions made and as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1421
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>among the dispossessed there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were great resources,</v>

1422
01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:22.923
<v Speaker 1>great talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One would imagine if the research were </v>

1423
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:25.024
<v Speaker 1>possible to the exact same degree is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is power and talent among the </v>

1424
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:29.314
<v Speaker 1>possessed because it's normally an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident of birth that decrees and </v>

1425
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:33.244
<v Speaker 1>reading about your early life in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a blue collar community and the sort </v>

1426
01:06:37.891 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>of the mental health issues and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger and agitation that grows there.</v>

1427
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.843
<v Speaker 1>So much of that is about resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dispossession of the native people </v>

1428
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:47.614
<v Speaker 1>of that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental health issues if your friend </v>

1429
01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Chris like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

1430
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>we the are rising through these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

1431
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:58.930
<v Speaker 1>We that have experiences of both sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that line.</v>

1432
01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now challenging this evolutionary</v>

1433
01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:02.464
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now in a position to talk about </v>

1434
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:05.074
<v Speaker 1>these hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're ordered and how they're </v>

1435
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>organized and whether there is room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>

1436
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to us to do that.</v>

1437
01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a risk in conservatism is </v>

1438
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:17.050
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is how the cards have fallen.</v>

1439
01:07:17.051 --> 01:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1440
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:19.730
<v Speaker 3>of course there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the risk and conservatives.</v>

1441
01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:22.550
<v Speaker 3>So how do we confront that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the risk is the,</v>

1442
01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1443
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchies ossify and turn to stone</v>

1444
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:27.883
<v Speaker 3>and then there's no mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that that things can turn </v>

1445
01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:33.800
<v Speaker 3>to stone and they become tyrannical is </v>
<v Speaker 3>an extraordinarily old idea.</v>

1446
01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:35.120
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1447
01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.670
<v Speaker 3>in the story of Exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of Moses.</v>

1448
01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:38.504
<v Speaker 3>So the Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptians are portrayed in that </v>

1449
01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.080
<v Speaker 3>story as tyrannical conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially,</v>

1450
01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're masters of stone.</v>

1451
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And Moses is a master of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And water is the thing that dissolves.</v>

1452
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:51.943
<v Speaker 3>And so that drama's been played out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these stories that are thousands of </v>

1453
01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.970
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the Egyptian story,</v>

1454
01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:58.340
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Egyptian story of Ocirus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horace,</v>

1455
01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.533
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cirrus is the old king who becomes too </v>

1456
01:08:01.941 --> 01:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens to him is that he's,</v>

1457
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.160
<v Speaker 3>he's dismembered by evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the consequence.</v>

1458
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:08.023
<v Speaker 3>And so even the Egyptians long ago knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the danger of hierarchies is they </v>

1459
01:08:11.331 --> 01:08:14.360
<v Speaker 3>become static and corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical.</v>

1460
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And part of what we do in our ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 3>political dialogue and it and,</v>

1461
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.780
<v Speaker 3>and when it's genuine dialogue is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1462
01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are these,</v>

1463
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 3>do these systems have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need them,</v>

1464
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:25.830
<v Speaker 3>they're there not avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1465
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 3>do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they functioning properly?</v>

1466
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Are they loose enough so that people can</v>
<v Speaker 3>move?</v>

1467
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:31.454
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they serving the broader good or </v>

1468
01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 3>have they degenerated into something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too tyrannical?</v>

1469
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1470
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.893
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of pointed to both of those in </v>

1471
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 3>the way you formulate that question </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said,</v>

1472
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:43.004
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my mum was in the hospital and she </v>

1473
01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:45.854
<v Speaker 3>needed care and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I found a surgeon who was an </v>

1474
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.170
<v Speaker 3>excellent surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1475
01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:53.540
<v Speaker 3>so what you did there basically was take</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bow to the,</v>

1476
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 3>you bowed before the functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy of the hospital and said,</v>

1477
01:08:58.671 --> 01:08:59.504
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest surgeon actually rose to </v>

1478
01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 3>the top and thank God for that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise my mother would be dead.</v>

1479
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:04.243
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1480
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.660
<v Speaker 3>that's our competency hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could be contaminated by tyranny,</v>

1481
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:09.494
<v Speaker 3>in which case it would be the brother of</v>
<v Speaker 3>some powerful person who ended up with </v>

1482
01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 3>the surgical position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1483
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:16.460
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that does happen in many,</v>

1484
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:17.294
<v Speaker 3>many cultures where nepotism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections define your position on </v>

1485
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 3>every oxys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you said,</v>

1486
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:24.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I went out to the hospital and I was</v>

1487
01:09:24.621 --> 01:09:25.454
<v Speaker 3>driving down the road and I saw what </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeared to be a misallocation of </v>

1488
01:09:28.341 --> 01:09:29.174
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we have to do about that is </v>

1489
01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 3>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a discussion about it constantly.</v>

1490
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.713
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we allocating resources to the </v>

1491
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 3>appropriate place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the,</v>

1492
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.413
<v Speaker 3>the other lurking problem there is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what degree do we decide about the </v>

1493
01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 3>allocation of resources by voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort,</v>

1494
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:49.550
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by planning,</v>

1495
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.250
<v Speaker 3>and to what degree do we let the market </v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of it.</v>

1496
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's also something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually requires negotiation.</v>

1497
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Mom's kate might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1498
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the,</v>

1499
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:00.740
<v Speaker 3>that's the question is able to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1500
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:01.574
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a neutral thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just a conglomeration of </v>

1501
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:06.260
<v Speaker 3>interests of the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1502
01:10:06.261 --> 01:10:06.801
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1503
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:09.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's that it can be that,</v>

1504
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 3>but it can also be the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectively value things.</v>

1505
01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me give you an example.</v>

1506
01:10:13.921 --> 01:10:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1507
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Look at our collective values and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just quickly say this.</v>

1508
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard this thing in Sweden.</v>

1509
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:18.923
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1510
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>conduct regulate and control access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol at a state level,</v>

1511
01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:26.870
<v Speaker 1>like off licenses or liquor stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of socially run and like,</v>

1512
01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.820
<v Speaker 1>and they're not allowed to be advertised</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden's,</v>

1513
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:29.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

1514
01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's one of those havens of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go,</v>

1515
01:10:32.341 --> 01:10:33.174
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what your views are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden by see a lot of stories about </v>

1516
01:10:34.621 --> 01:10:35.251
<v Speaker 1>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same,</v>

1517
01:10:35.251 --> 01:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>a bit like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1518
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.393
<v Speaker 1>we swayed and comes across as this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I sort of this sort of </v>

1519
01:10:40.381 --> 01:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>postmodern democracy or in some respects</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>

1520
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1521
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.533
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was curious that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>control alcohol in that manner and I am </v>

1522
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>envisaged that sort of breweries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquor distributors would say,</v>

1523
01:10:51.571 --> 01:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not free market.</v>

1524
01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:55.260
<v Speaker 1>You're controlling access to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1525
01:10:55.290 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>people's access to alcohol as if somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free market was neutral,</v>

1526
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but they ease no neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the market is what has the power,</v>

1527
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.110
<v Speaker 1>people's desires will be overly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulated.</v>

1528
01:11:07.111 --> 01:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>People if people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people have McDonald's advertise that</v>

1529
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>they're more alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise at them people,</v>

1530
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's</v>

1531
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.173
<v Speaker 3>and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be some more realizing </v>

1532
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.793
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be something that's not </v>

1533
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:19.854
<v Speaker 3>economically led.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not the manifestation of greed </v>

1534
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 3>that's in the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone in a secular society where there</v>

1535
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:28.524
<v Speaker 3>is no reasonable or trusted voice of God</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be able to say don't drink too </v>

1536
01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 3>much alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too Much Mcdonald's cause people will.</v>

1537
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1538
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>so let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1539
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:39.923
<v Speaker 3>I think the most effective solution to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that problem is to have the economic </v>

1540
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 3>system run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say by distributed individuals who</v>

1541
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:53.550
<v Speaker 3>are themselves aiming at a higher good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the way that you,</v>

1542
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.340
<v Speaker 3>the most effective way of regulating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>market so to speak,</v>

1543
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:57.503
<v Speaker 3>is to improve the moral character of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who make up the market rather </v>

1544
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:01.164
<v Speaker 3>than directly regulating the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not that the market doesn't </v>

1545
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:07.680
<v Speaker 3>necessarily need some regulation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

1546
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:08.514
<v Speaker 3>well how about we don't devote alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertising to children under 10 most </v>

1547
01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:15.120
<v Speaker 3>people would agree that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable perspective.</v>

1548
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 3>And so that is limitation on market </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

1549
01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:19.110
<v Speaker 3>And there are places that you can find </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1550
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:20.263
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that limitation being accepted by </v>

1551
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:23.970
<v Speaker 3>almost anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1552
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.013
<v Speaker 3>but the part of what you're pointing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if the only thing that's </v>

1553
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:30.264
<v Speaker 3>governing the market is concerned for </v>
<v Speaker 3>pure market success than the market can </v>

1554
01:12:33.841 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 3>produce all sorts of excesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what you want,</v>

1555
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.123
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want is to help orient people </v>

1556
01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:43.770
<v Speaker 3>towards a transcendent good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1557
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's over and above market interest.</v>

1558
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.300
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1559
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:49.283
<v Speaker 3>what interests should you serve as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to be successful as a </v>

1560
01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:51.924
<v Speaker 3>comedian or in while you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a living as a comedian say you </v>

1561
01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:57.780
<v Speaker 3>might want to make sure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>conducting yourself appropriately in the</v>

1562
01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.910
<v Speaker 3>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're concerned about yourself,</v>

1563
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:02.820
<v Speaker 3>but also your future selves because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to take,</v>

1564
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 3>and that's partly why addiction is such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a catastrophe,</v>

1565
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1566
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:05.933
<v Speaker 3>Because it's great in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not so good in the medium to </v>

1567
01:13:08.131 --> 01:13:08.964
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to take care of yourself </v>

1568
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your,</v>

1569
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.893
<v Speaker 3>your iterations through the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to take care of yourself in a </v>

1570
01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:16.890
<v Speaker 3>way that you're taking care of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1571
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.143
<v Speaker 3>You have to take care of yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your family in a way that you're </v>

1572
01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 3>benefiting the community and that should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be foremost in your mind.</v>

1573
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 3>So then when you start to make economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>

1574
01:13:25.471 --> 01:13:27.570
<v Speaker 3>even in your business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not saying,</v>

1575
01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to do whatever I can to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make as much money as I can.</v>

1576
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:31.343
<v Speaker 3>You're going to say I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I can to make as much money as </v>

1577
01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I can while also making sure that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of myself and my future self</v>

1578
01:13:38.821 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 3>and my family and my community and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Grat,</v>

1579
01:13:42.211 --> 01:13:45.180
<v Speaker 3>grateful for all of that and serving it </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

1580
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 3>And then I think the market can work </v>
<v Speaker 3>more effectively but still might require</v>

1581
01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:51.930
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some discussion around the edges because</v>

1582
01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:52.764
<v Speaker 3>you know nothing is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the re the reason that I'm </v>

1583
01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:55.944
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual development is because I </v>

1584
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:00.930
<v Speaker 3>think that's the best way to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>regulation.</v>

1585
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:01.973
<v Speaker 3>I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's non negotiable I think is </v>

1586
01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:05.124
<v Speaker 3>necessary by also believe that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a society this predicate it on the </v>

1587
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>some of the worst of human</v>

1588
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost the desire fear.</v>

1589
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 2>If last fear and desire are so high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mix,</v>

1590
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're continually being prompted </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards onanism and consuming,</v>

1591
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that individual improvement</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be insufficient.</v>

1592
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I re I feel that your success is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know it was based on,</v>

1593
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 2>but I feel that to a degree you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>contacted people and oh yeah,</v>

1594
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:35.734
<v Speaker 2>I can improve my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can have a bit of personal authority </v>

1595
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>and autonomy and I think that's hugely </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

1596
01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 2>But if every time you step out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

1597
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:44.410
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if every time you interface with society</v>

1598
01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 2>or pick up your phone or look at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>

1599
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the aspect of yourself as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurtured,</v>

1600
01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 2>that's being invited to participate are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower aspects of your nature because</v>

1601
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:57.901
<v Speaker 2>those are the most successful routes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a person's decision making impulses.</v>

1602
01:14:58.170 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceed.</v>

1603
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual projects to x to succeed.</v>

1604
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:05.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1605
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:08.020
<v Speaker 2>certain people will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that message will take hold,</v>

1606
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 2>but others it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on to some degree we,</v>

1607
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I ain't like a big fan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>

1608
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:16.564
<v Speaker 2>I understand your irritation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's being like this sort of a post </v>

1609
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:21.843
<v Speaker 2>modern deconstruction list argument of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that destroy God that's destroy all </v>

1610
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1611
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of it's real.</v>

1612
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I believe in essence the humours the day</v>
<v Speaker 2>or tease the gods.</v>

1613
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:33.783
<v Speaker 2>I feel these things are present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel that we are already being </v>

1614
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:37.504
<v Speaker 2>subject to a kind of invisible tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's already happening and I don't </v>

1615
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:41.644
<v Speaker 2>think it's happening as a result of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some critical theory postmarks just </v>

1616
01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.121
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that,</v>

1617
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:49.420
<v Speaker 2>that's not where power is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That feels like it's sort of,</v>

1618
01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel like it's just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1619
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Was Glaxo Klein or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1620
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:59.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1621
01:15:59.181 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1622
01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did his power,</v>

1623
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 2>real power and how power is functioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how power is the,</v>

1624
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively impacting ordinary people?</v>

1625
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's perfectly reasonable to </v>

1626
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:13.414
<v Speaker 2>point out that there might be multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that people experience tyrannical </v>

1627
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 2>oppression now because every hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to tilt towards tyrannical form</v>

1628
01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:23.224
<v Speaker 2>in its own particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been concerned about what's </v>

1629
01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 2>happening in the university on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical left and your concern,</v>

1630
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:30.820
<v Speaker 2>the concern that you just brought up is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

1631
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:31.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming large scale corporate </v>

1632
01:16:35.111 --> 01:16:38.050
<v Speaker 2>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's also a reasonable set</v>

1633
01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 2>of concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1634
01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:41.590
<v Speaker 2>it might not be for the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1635
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 2>that all of our communication is </v>
<v Speaker 2>filtered through google.</v>

1636
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:47.810
<v Speaker 2>That might be a bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1637
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question always is,</v>

1638
01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:53.200
<v Speaker 2>is what we can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the answer,</v>

1639
01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>the answer is an answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

1640
01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:56.463
<v Speaker 2>The answer is we can lead people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate untrammeled and </v>

1641
01:17:01.091 --> 01:17:03.070
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I'm an advocate of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

1642
01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:03.904
<v Speaker 2>We can lead people's ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate untrammeled so that we can </v>

1643
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>have intelligent discussions about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems as they emerge</v>

1644
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.843
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully work towards solutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can't just generate a </v>

1645
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:14.234
<v Speaker 3>structure of rules that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's the 10 rules that are going </v>

1646
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:17.714
<v Speaker 3>to deal without complex situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>because things change too rapidly for </v>

1647
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:23.420
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that freedom of speech as</v>

1648
01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned is the paramount </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

1649
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:26.660
<v Speaker 3>the paramount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1650
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Also the paramount moral obligation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's through the,</v>

1651
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.460
<v Speaker 3>it's through our ability to exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1652
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.050
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to um,</v>

1653
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.433
<v Speaker 3>to exchange honest opinions that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate in the process that enables </v>

1654
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:41.834
<v Speaker 3>us to keep tyranny of the sort that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>described and the sort that I described </v>

1655
01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:45.524
<v Speaker 3>out bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of the reason that I've </v>

1656
01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:49.430
<v Speaker 3>taken the tack I have politically is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1657
01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.293
<v Speaker 3>well my government had the gall to </v>
<v Speaker 3>implement compelled speech legislation </v>

1658
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 3>without noticing what it was that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were interfering with.</v>

1659
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Cause you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well well that's,</v>

1660
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.260
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep tyranny at bay free?</v>

1661
01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 3>The Ex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the proper exchange of ideas between</v>

1662
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:09.740
<v Speaker 3>free individuals keeps tyranny at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best we've got.</v>

1663
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:10.783
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also I think a gift that England </v>

1664
01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.054
<v Speaker 3>and in in large part has given to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the world to formalize and </v>

1665
01:18:17.181 --> 01:18:18.014
<v Speaker 3>codify that to put it into a body of law</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a wreck governmental structures that </v>

1666
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:21.914
<v Speaker 3>are really predicated on that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a remarkable achievement and it's </v>

1667
01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:27.110
<v Speaker 3>something we should be profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful for.</v>

1668
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:28.383
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the taking </v>

1669
01:18:29.951 --> 01:18:30.784
<v Speaker 1>that accepting praise on the behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>England there as an English person I </v>

1670
01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 1>accept that there are two dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is the inner and the at least</v>

1671
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:44.560
<v Speaker 1>unless until we've reached some </v>
<v Speaker 1>non-dualistic utopia where everything is</v>

1672
01:18:44.561 --> 01:18:45.394
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is the inner tracking of our own </v>

1673
01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:48.874
<v Speaker 1>desires and fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose like when we're talking </v>

1674
01:18:51.941 --> 01:18:52.774
<v Speaker 1>about management of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a phrase that we could give the </v>

1675
01:18:55.181 --> 01:18:57.610
<v Speaker 1>came up earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the where,</v>

1676
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.090
<v Speaker 1>where does the attention need to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

1677
01:19:01.091 --> 01:19:01.924
<v Speaker 1>Like you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's something about my </v>

1678
01:19:02.891 --> 01:19:06.520
<v Speaker 1>background that has led me to identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Dragon.</v>

1679
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:07.383
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's consumerism is turning people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into consumers because obviously as an </v>

1680
01:19:09.671 --> 01:19:12.970
<v Speaker 1>addict that's what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consumer and roll truck and Schumer.</v>

1681
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And it seems that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your background in academia,</v>

1682
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1683
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this a neo Marxist post because,</v>

1684
01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.710
<v Speaker 1>but when I sort of like think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of socialism,</v>

1685
01:19:23.711 --> 01:19:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Eg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1686
01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.020
<v Speaker 1>people are working too hard.</v>

1687
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:26.853
<v Speaker 1>You should only work four hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be time for fishing in the </v>

1688
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.620
<v Speaker 1>afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is in Das kapital.</v>

1689
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.533
<v Speaker 1>Vicky talks about fishing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and for me that seems like a </v>

1690
01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:39.871
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful and fair and just idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also I don't see them like wow,</v>

1691
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine that they're irritating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a campus,</v>

1692
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:50.140
<v Speaker 1>particularly for somebody who's research</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a lot.</v>

1693
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't see them as powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

1694
01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that's part of my intrigue I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's comparable to when I was talking to</v>

1695
01:19:59.621 --> 01:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris and other post do I have maya</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whom I go,</v>

1696
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:03.070
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like,</v>

1697
01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:03.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm talking to Sam Harris </v>

1698
01:20:04.961 --> 01:20:06.520
<v Speaker 1>about Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go be a,</v>

1699
01:20:06.521 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>but when like where's how</v>

1700
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>is Islam at gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I feel like it,</v>

1701
01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:11.733
<v Speaker 3>even if he's aware of Saudi Arabia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia as an </v>

1702
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:15.654
<v Speaker 3>economic entity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not an Islamic entity in terms </v>

1703
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 3>of race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go do some Islam.</v>

1704
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like let's go do some business know</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1705
01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:25.860
<v Speaker 3>and so I suppose here what my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1706
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.280
<v Speaker 3>well I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly with the emphasis on,</v>

1707
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:34.830
<v Speaker 3>on the collective identity rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual identity.</v>

1708
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Like the process that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>

1709
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.633
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the answer to the question </v>

1710
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:41.334
<v Speaker 3>that you posed at the beginning of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is is there something </v>

1711
01:20:43.261 --> 01:20:45.330
<v Speaker 3>universal about the process that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out?</v>

1712
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:46.583
<v Speaker 3>And I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's at the core of </v>

1713
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 3>individual development and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most powerful of forces.</v>

1714
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:53.783
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be regarded as the proper locus </v>

1715
01:20:56.431 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 3>of evaluation.</v>

1716
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 3>And the problem I have with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern neo marxists types apart from</v>

1717
01:21:00.691 --> 01:21:01.524
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there were analysis tends </v>
<v Speaker 3>to lead to a kind of nihilism is that </v>

1718
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 3>because they're making the group the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paramount level of analysis,</v>

1719
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.310
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing gets ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1720
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.173
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to do in my work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a program called the self </v>

1721
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:15.774
<v Speaker 3>authoring program that kind of steps </v>
<v Speaker 3>people through these 12 steps that you </v>

1722
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:19.224
<v Speaker 3>just described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First thing that people do is write </v>

1723
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 3>about their past all the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1724
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.460
<v Speaker 3>The second thing they do is take an </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventory of their personality,</v>

1725
01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:27.294
<v Speaker 3>faults and virtues so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>rectify the faults and capitalized on </v>

1726
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:31.194
<v Speaker 3>the virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the third thing they do is chart a </v>

1727
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:37.140
<v Speaker 3>course for the future that takes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into account and others.</v>

1728
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:38.423
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see it as a reflection of this </v>

1729
01:21:40.261 --> 01:21:41.094
<v Speaker 3>universal process that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>described and I think it's the most </v>

1730
01:21:43.831 --> 01:21:46.260
<v Speaker 3>powerful form of transformation.</v>

1731
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.393
<v Speaker 3>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's the one that risks </v>

1732
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:53.010
<v Speaker 3>doing the least harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it hasn't heard anybody that you've</v>

1733
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:55.650
<v Speaker 3>put yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just good,</v>

1734
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you.</v>

1735
01:21:57.091 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 3>It's good for the people that know you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing about it.</v>

1736
01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the right level of humility because</v>

1737
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 3>you took what you knew to be wrong in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your experience.</v>

1738
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 3>You took personal responsibility for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made changes for yourself.</v>

1739
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:12.893
<v Speaker 3>You didn't go around pointing the finger</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what was wrong with the external </v>

1740
01:22:15.211 --> 01:22:17.760
<v Speaker 3>world and trying to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now look,</v>

1741
01:22:17.761 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 3>it could easily be that once you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>your act together,</v>

1742
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:21.654
<v Speaker 3>or maybe even before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be doing some things to </v>

1743
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 3>adjust political systems or sociological</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

1744
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:30.780
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you can trust yourself?</v>

1745
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:32.401
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1746
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:33.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm compassionate.</v>

1747
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:34.224
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're also envious of the </v>

1748
01:22:35.761 --> 01:22:39.000
<v Speaker 3>successful and the probability of that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn high,</v>

1749
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:39.834
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1750
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.200
<v Speaker 3>And so you better know before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>express that compassion,</v>

1751
01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:44.034
<v Speaker 3>especially in the political domain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that is contaminated by </v>

1752
01:22:46.771 --> 01:22:48.960
<v Speaker 3>things about yourself that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>contended with.</v>

1753
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you think an on declaration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1754
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:52.853
<v Speaker 3>along those lines or specifically that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the political field would be </v>

1755
01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:57.690
<v Speaker 3>refreshing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1756
01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a very funny thing.</v>

1757
01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:03.300
<v Speaker 3>So the ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia.</v>

1758
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>So this is some of the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 3>political we have,</v>

1759
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:06.814
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what they used to do to the </v>

1760
01:23:07.811 --> 01:23:09.970
<v Speaker 3>emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every new year's Day,</v>

1761
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 3>they would take him outside the walls of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city.</v>

1762
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.580
<v Speaker 3>So he was responsible for everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>within the walls.</v>

1763
01:23:15.581 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Outside was chaos and the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd take them outside the city,</v>

1764
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 3>they'd strip him of all his emperor </v>
<v Speaker 3>garb.</v>

1765
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:24.220
<v Speaker 3>So he's no longer emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd make him kneel,</v>

1766
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.930
<v Speaker 3>they'd humiliate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

1767
01:23:25.931 --> 01:23:26.764
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the priest would hit him with a glove </v>

1768
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1769
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:31.143
<v Speaker 3>in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how name all the ways that you didn't </v>

1770
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:38.710
<v Speaker 3>embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamians.</v>

1771
01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 3>And Marduk was the thing that took on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the great dragon of chaos.</v>

1772
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.200
<v Speaker 3>And so it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the responsibility of the emperor</v>

1773
01:23:45.201 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to kneel down and say,</v>

1774
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.033
<v Speaker 3>here's all the ways that I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting out my proper self and had </v>

1775
01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 3>brought the kingdom into disarray and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he would be forgiven.</v>

1776
01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:57.640
<v Speaker 3>They would act out the reconstruction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos.</v>

1777
01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:01.090
<v Speaker 3>That was the New Year's celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd go in and try to be a good</v>

1778
01:24:01.091 --> 01:24:02.010
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1779
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1780
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no kidding.</v>

1781
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:04.294
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the confession of the emperor </v>

1782
01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.660
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the way I haven't been good</v>

1783
01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and at any comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1784
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 1>and the powerful held up to that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluation in,</v>

1785
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 1>we don't have rituals for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1786
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I suppose we don't acknowledge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of order from chaos.</v>

1787
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1788
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.500
<v Speaker 1>a merge [inaudible] knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine principles.</v>

1789
01:24:23.501 --> 01:24:24.334
<v Speaker 1>So the powerful and light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is possibly because of </v>

1790
01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 1>a assumed meritocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1791
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 1>people that are in positions of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there for a reason.</v>

1792
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:30.994
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to start stripping him </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked and take them outside of the city </v>

1793
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:33.454
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often did you rank in that Oval </v>

1794
01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day get out.</v>

1795
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think there might be something to</v>

1796
01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the danger of pride that goes</v>

1797
01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:43.960
<v Speaker 1>along with ascension in a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1798
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>because I'm here in this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must deserve it.</v>

1799
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:46.931
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1800
01:24:46.931 --> 01:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>but there should still be something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bowing down to.</v>

1801
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the abstract idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign authority itself.</v>

1802
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.420
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it only </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

1803
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.403
<v Speaker 1>that's a figure that essentially has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch of divinity about it because it's </v>

1804
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the on a key right now harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Queen,</v>

1805
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 1>the anointed and appointed monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She represents,</v>

1806
01:25:07.751 --> 01:25:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by I suppose in a post secular nation,</v>

1807
01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:14.440
<v Speaker 1>she becomes the emblem of Britain rondon</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emblem of God on,</v>

1808
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:15.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1809
01:25:15.191 --> 01:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually functions to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in the same line.</v>

1810
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think so because the queen your </v>

1811
01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>queen in particular our queen as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe an alien.</v>

1812
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:26.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think Alyssa has been,</v>

1813
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1814
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an embodiment of moral virtue.</v>

1815
01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.613
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's done a remarkable job over the </v>

1816
01:25:31.611 --> 01:25:32.301
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

1817
01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:35.390
<v Speaker 3>75 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's held herself to an incredibly high</v>

1818
01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:36.224
<v Speaker 3>moral standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think she does sit in the </v>

1819
01:25:37.431 --> 01:25:39.680
<v Speaker 3>background as emblematic of what</v>

1820
01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.590
<v Speaker 1>sovereign authority might look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you postmodernist.</v>

1821
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:44.780
<v Speaker 1>And this is an area where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

1822
01:25:44.781 --> 01:25:45.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm English and I can't get away from </v>

1823
01:25:46.491 --> 01:25:47.324
<v Speaker 1>the love of the Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would also say that she is an </v>

1824
01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:54.431
<v Speaker 1>emblem of authority and of power and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and land ownership.</v>

1825
01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.753
<v Speaker 1>And that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is an order that ought be </v>

1826
01:25:58.431 --> 01:25:59.264
<v Speaker 1>respected and can't be challenged every </v>
<v Speaker 1>so often this country sort of toys with </v>

1827
01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the idea of they're always</v>

1828
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.350
<v Speaker 3>grateful when there's a wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1829
01:26:05.351 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's this week so that no one has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to think,</v>

1830
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:08.383
<v Speaker 3>is this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we paying for this bizarre </v>

1831
01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 3>spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>

1832
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:15.140
<v Speaker 3>but it is useful to think about it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic sense.</v>

1833
01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:15.974
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that constantly </v>

1834
01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 3>threatens the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be four branches of</v>

1835
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislative,</v>

1836
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>judicial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>executive,</v>

1837
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 3>and symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem in the United States</v>

1838
01:26:28.071 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 3>is the president keeps tilting towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

1839
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Americans like the idea of the first</v>

1840
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 3>family and the first lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1841
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1842
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.260
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1843
01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.560
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of tilts towards a dynasty.</v>

1844
01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And you've seen that happen with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bushes and the Clintons and it's not,</v>

1845
01:26:42.561 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good thing.</v>

1846
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 3>And it might be nice to have someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the symbolic load off the president</v>

1847
01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:49.244
<v Speaker 3>and just act that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your queen does that very nicely </v>

1848
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:52.423
<v Speaker 3>because all of the pomp and circumstance</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state and all the drama and </v>

1849
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:59.210
<v Speaker 3>ritual of the sovereign can be played </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in that sort of dramatic space.</v>

1850
01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.133
<v Speaker 3>And your legislature and executive </v>
<v Speaker 3>branches can go off and do the </v>

1851
01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:04.460
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that the,</v>

1852
01:27:04.461 --> 01:27:05.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1853
01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:05.973
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dentist's ds exert themselves in a </v>

1854
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:09.434
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a demonstration of your argument </v>

1855
01:27:11.361 --> 01:27:12.194
<v Speaker 3>that there are certain hierarchal </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems that find their way into </v>

1856
01:27:13.941 --> 01:27:14.774
<v Speaker 3>fruition regardless of regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I suppose there's rational </v>

1857
01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:19.940
<v Speaker 3>reasons they would have the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experiences that can,</v>

1858
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.803
<v Speaker 3>the connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1859
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.510
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's also the d that's a danger to</v>

1860
01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:24.344
<v Speaker 3>a republic is the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's part of the potential </v>

1861
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.374
<v Speaker 3>corruption of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that while it's easier for the </v>

1862
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 3>children of those who have authority to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have power,</v>

1863
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:34.543
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want people attaining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle of achievement because of </v>

1864
01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:38.114
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he want them attending the pinnacle of </v>

1865
01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:41.640
<v Speaker 3>achievement because of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1866
01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1867
01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 3>and those things always struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all,</v>

1868
01:27:44.241 --> 01:27:44.721
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1869
01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:45.554
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a society that's very awake to </v>

1870
01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:48.494
<v Speaker 3>stop the hierarchies from degenerating </v>
<v Speaker 3>into hierarchies of power because the </v>

1871
01:27:51.771 --> 01:27:53.440
<v Speaker 3>generation is the tendency.</v>

1872
01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's easy,</v>

1873
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:59.600
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wba that fearsome and terrifying.</v>

1874
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1875
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 3>faulconer pallium well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people have recognized that it's the</v>

1876
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 3>proclivity of hierarchies to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards tyranny for,</v>

1877
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:10.550
<v Speaker 3>for really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for thousands of years.</v>

1878
01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:14.660
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen that as a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>danger to proper adaptation.</v>

1879
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:16.550
<v Speaker 3>We need hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1880
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 3>But they degenerate into tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they unfairly,</v>

1881
01:28:19.941 --> 01:28:20.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press.</v>

1882
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:21.463
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1883
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.633
<v Speaker 3>we have to be on guard against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean that we call all </v>

1884
01:28:25.191 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies tyrannies cause that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

1885
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Or we call all productive activity </v>
<v Speaker 3>service in the,</v>

1886
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.593
<v Speaker 3>in the service to the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy because that's seriously not </v>

1887
01:28:36.531 --> 01:28:37.364
<v Speaker 3>how helpful and we don't dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies because then people don't </v>

1888
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 3>have anything to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>

1889
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.093
<v Speaker 3>So I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the beam out your iheart like so </v>

1890
01:28:44.781 --> 01:28:48.760
<v Speaker 3>say if the individual is tuned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the individual is at channel,</v>

1891
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the prayer of Saint Francis.</v>

1892
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I like it as a model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They invites us to find the reverse of h</v>

1893
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.273
<v Speaker 3>a defective characteristic that we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sin that we might be living out to </v>

1894
01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 3>become a channel of some inherent </v>
<v Speaker 3>goodness.</v>

1895
01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:10.443
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting rolled out or two </v>

1896
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:13.224
<v Speaker 3>things actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first is the word sin means to miss </v>

1897
01:29:15.631 --> 01:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>the target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an archery term.</v>

1898
01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:18.413
<v Speaker 3>So that's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very interesting way of </v>

1899
01:29:19.651 --> 01:29:21.830
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a target,</v>

1900
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 3>there is a target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1901
01:29:23.671 --> 01:29:25.190
<v Speaker 3>But the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

1902
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.213
<v Speaker 3>this comes right out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's very useful to become aware of </v>

1903
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 3>your faults because as soon as you pause</v>
<v Speaker 3>it a fault,</v>

1904
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you pause it the opposite by merely </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1905
01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:35.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fault.</v>

1906
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.413
<v Speaker 3>You're saying implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while there's something that's the </v>

1907
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:40.530
<v Speaker 3>opposite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so out of your recognition of faults,</v>

1908
01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>immediately some clarity of virtue </v>
<v Speaker 3>develops because you might say,</v>

1909
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:46.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fault and I really know it.</v>

1910
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:47.101
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1911
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 3>you've got some bedrock there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the opposite of that fault is,</v>

1912
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:51.923
<v Speaker 3>you might not know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever the opposite of that fault </v>

1913
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a virtue.</v>

1914
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1915
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I have 20 faults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like great.</v>

1916
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.160
<v Speaker 3>The opposite of the personality that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those 20 faults is the virtuous you,</v>

1917
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.180
<v Speaker 3>whatever that might happen to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1918
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:07.014
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've then you've conjured out of </v>

1919
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.530
<v Speaker 3>the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1920
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a redeemer.</v>

1921
01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:12.780
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

1922
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.260
<v Speaker 3>And the UN doubtedly both in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmology and fleeting morality,</v>

1923
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:24.090
<v Speaker 3>there is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is vastness,</v>

1924
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.133
<v Speaker 3>but there are also patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are patterns that emerge and </v>

1925
01:30:27.871 --> 01:30:32.460
<v Speaker 3>whether you call that pattern male or </v>
<v Speaker 3>love or beauty,</v>

1926
01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:35.500
<v Speaker 3>there are various patterns and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is,</v>

1927
01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 3>there is something to get in alignment </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1928
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:39.960
<v Speaker 3>There is a choon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is harmony,</v>

1929
01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 3>there is melody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is grace.</v>

1930
01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 3>We're not totally rested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you're using their musical musical,</v>

1931
01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:47.334
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1932
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.860
<v Speaker 3>what would you call analogies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful representations.</v>

1933
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:50.783
<v Speaker 3>That's what music expresses is to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that in harmony because people </v>

1934
01:30:53.851 --> 01:30:55.950
<v Speaker 3>love music because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1935
01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 3>in those patterns because music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about music,</v>

1936
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.244
<v Speaker 3>it is the harmonious interaction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns and you just described all </v>

1937
01:31:02.230 --> 01:31:04.400
<v Speaker 3>those positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1938
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spirits.</v>

1939
01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:07.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as patterns,</v>

1940
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:08.933
<v Speaker 3>while they are patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think that there's a </v>

1941
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:12.750
<v Speaker 3>pattern that's composed of all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>

1942
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're after the pattern that's composed</v>

1943
01:31:16.021 --> 01:31:17.730
<v Speaker 3>of all those patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1944
01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:18.564
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to put yourself in harmony </v>

1945
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:21.930
<v Speaker 3>with that and that is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing.</v>

1946
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.100
<v Speaker 3>You can feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's what keeps you alive essentially</v>

1947
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.000
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to become conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1948
01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.350
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is something important happening.</v>

1949
01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:32.483
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what we were saying before </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the acknowledgement of difference </v>

1950
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.133
<v Speaker 3>need an infor inferiority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is something that definitely not </v>

1951
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:43.190
<v Speaker 3>while we should be actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1952
01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:47.250
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of what the radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists keeps saying is,</v>

1953
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should celebrate diversity.</v>

1954
01:31:49.021 --> 01:31:50.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1955
01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:54.380
<v Speaker 3>but what that means first is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>admission that people actually differ.</v>

1956
01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always you don't have diversity.</v>

1957
01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:58.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad there are conservatives.</v>

1958
01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad there are leftists.</v>

1959
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 2>The conservatives run things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leftists invent them.</v>

1960
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:06.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like good and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1961
01:32:06.911 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Those people like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1962
01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:11.260
<v Speaker 2>if you have a group that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and they're going down the</v>

1963
01:32:11.261 --> 01:32:12.094
<v Speaker 2>right path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go down that path </v>

1964
01:32:13.031 --> 01:32:13.864
<v Speaker 2>really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they're going down the wrong </v>

1965
01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:15.904
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be able to think </v>

1966
01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.430
<v Speaker 2>laterally and figure out how to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1967
01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:21.670
<v Speaker 2>If you have a group of of left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative types,</v>

1968
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're going to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred ideas,</v>

1969
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:25.143
<v Speaker 2>but the probability that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize in a stable hierarchy and </v>

1970
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:29.103
<v Speaker 2>implement those effectively is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's they're going to have to call over </v>

1971
01:32:32.021 --> 01:32:33.040
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1972
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we finally got a good idea.</v>

1973
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.333
<v Speaker 2>You can have one idea cause you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives run with it and then they </v>

1974
01:32:39.581 --> 01:32:40.414
<v Speaker 2>can all run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really good that we have </v>

1975
01:32:42.371 --> 01:32:43.204
<v Speaker 2>people who are like that on both sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the distribution because otherwise </v>

1976
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:47.333
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creative types would sit around and </v>

1977
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:52.530
<v Speaker 2>come up with new ideas until they starve</v>
<v Speaker 2>to death in squalor.</v>

1978
01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:56.490
<v Speaker 2>And while exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Conservatives would just awesome</v>

1979
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 2>fi and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1980
01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.300
<v Speaker 2>run down a road that got narrower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow,</v>

1981
01:33:01.301 --> 01:33:02.134
<v Speaker 2>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd all end up stuck between two </v>

1982
01:33:03.221 --> 01:33:05.890
<v Speaker 2>cliffs and that'd be the end of it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them.</v>

1983
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antithesis,</v>

1984
01:33:07.511 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 2>synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We require synthesis.</v>

1985
01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:12.610
<v Speaker 2>This is how does the interplay of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites.</v>

1986
01:33:12.611 --> 01:33:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Actual opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:33:14.051 --> 01:33:14.621
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1988
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:15.454
<v Speaker 2>The Yin Yang that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be necessary collusion </v>

1989
01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 2>between distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for that to happen,</v>

1990
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:24.730
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be acknowledgement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition of difference in a trying to</v>

1991
01:33:24.731 --> 01:33:28.960
<v Speaker 2>achieve a quality with the Annihilation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of category is not successful.</v>

1992
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

1993
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.230
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1994
01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:36.160
<v Speaker 2>That is not a successful route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1995
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Duck tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Jordan Peterson.</v>

1996
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:41.350
<v Speaker 2>We have good chats that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was great.</v>

1997
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really good.</v>

1998

<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for inviting me back.</v>
