<v Speaker 1>and us and trillium pound island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's written articles for the Guardian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>changing our world,</v>

<v Speaker 1>handshakes that never make the news by </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionizing everything we do.</v>

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to our show.</v>

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.801
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bless.</v>

9
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Bless you for inviting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really thrilled that you're here.</v>

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.643
<v Speaker 1>I'm just give you a quick understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like what my motivation is at </v>

11
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.694
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a course religion in global </v>

12
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:41.781
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sal,</v>

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>as universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

14
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:43.914
<v Speaker 1>really enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting an academic understanding of </v>

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>things that are intuitively understood </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little while now.</v>

16
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:50.874
<v Speaker 1>Like your field of expertise is often </v>
<v Speaker 1>submerged financial narrative that's </v>

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>actually governing and dominate in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>world from an ecological perspective.</v>

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a media can,</v>

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.423
<v Speaker 1>can you follow the money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need to do that old </v>

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

21
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>But it happens to be a cliche for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:14.904
<v Speaker 1>which is if you follow the money and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand where the money's coming </v>

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's making the money,</v>

24
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.173
<v Speaker 1>what the economics underlying everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do from the coffee we buy to the job </v>

25
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:25.464
<v Speaker 1>we go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we decided to buy that phone </v>

26
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:28.404
<v Speaker 1>over over another phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things have economics of </v>

27
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.554
<v Speaker 1>their heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't understand </v>

28
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:33.054
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand how the world </v>

29
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What then should we understand about the</v>

30
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>world is we're experiencing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>who are the dominant economic players </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are determining what happens in the</v>

32
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>lives of ordinary people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>trump has thrown a kind of spanner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the works and he's kind of,</v>

35
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what that represents as we </v>

36
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:56.784
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it represents of kind of dislocation </v>

37
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>of the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old status quo.</v>

38
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>But that was because that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

39
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And essentially what we've had over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 40 years,</v>

40
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>and he's a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a symptom or public a creation</v>

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>

42
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>what we call corporate capture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

43
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.664
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's the creeping end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government elected government and the </v>

44
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>rise of global corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of know about that.</v>

45
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.523
<v Speaker 1>But I think what's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that for me is that corporations </v>

46
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.773
<v Speaker 1>haven't done this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of some kind of evil </v>

47
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:30.804
<v Speaker 1>machiavellian plot is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just been a kind of failure of </v>

48
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.134
<v Speaker 1>government to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run the countries that they </v>

49
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>supposedly run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>

50
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>You have a world that I see is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.023
<v Speaker 1>the operates on two different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have horizontally and corporations </v>

52
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>who operate across the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't have any,</v>

53
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any need to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial boundaries.</v>

54
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.883
<v Speaker 1>Governments operate vertically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They operate within the narrow </v>

55
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>constraints of the geographical state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they operate.</v>

56
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.723
<v Speaker 1>The two just don't meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think as the world's become </v>

57
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>increasingly globalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations have just got the whip hand</v>

58
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>and essentially government has become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of civil service for corporations.</v>

59
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So the nation state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a relatively modern idea,</v>

60
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 1>is already been made in empower terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>redundant because of the global power of</v>

61
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:27.121
<v Speaker 1>transnational corporations and the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resurgence of an f,</v>

62
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>no identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just sort of a response to that.</v>

63
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the corporation,</v>

64
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.233
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that that's just the kind of </v>

66
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>logic of the way economics has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Putin,</v>

68
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really the leader of Russia,</v>

69
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

70
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 1>He's the CEO of Russia Plc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is the ceo of a corporation called</v>

71
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.793
<v Speaker 1>and so I think it's interesting that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have business people in autocrats who </v>

73
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.894
<v Speaker 1>are increasingly coming to prominence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a kind of almost </v>

74
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>implicit realization that that's the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state has to be run.</v>

75
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>So iT's not as sort of right kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

76
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:15.634
<v Speaker 1>It's just that that's the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the world is going to mimic </v>

77
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>corporate models because the corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>model is now the dominant model.</v>

78
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>They stay idea sort of redundant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make sense now and we know that,</v>

79
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:30.120
<v Speaker 1>but we Can't admit that bEcause </v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise democracy becomes a explicitly</v>

80
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

81
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And you had that under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the cameron and under blair,</v>

82
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.744
<v Speaker 1>you had the first sort of intimations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this where they started talking about </v>

83
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>the John Lewis model or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd start to say,</v>

84
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if britain was run like John Lewis,</v>

85
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that sort of got the adverts.</v>

86
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's become the google model.</v>

87
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you know,</v>

88
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>how can I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to this conference where,</v>

89
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>which was basically run by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was organized by big corporate,</v>

90
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>big corporations and they asked me to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and speak to them and I said,</v>

91
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>well said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you not seen my documentaries?</v>

92
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You know why you're asking me to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into something.</v>

93
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were interested in what you had to </v>

94
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.124
<v Speaker 1>say and the way they were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking aboUt corporate tax </v>

95
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>specifically about corporation tax and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the avoidance,</v>

96
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>which is an issue in the air remains an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in the air.</v>

97
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>They were sort of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.123
<v Speaker 1>tax is such a redundant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'S such an inefficient way of </v>

99
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>collecting money from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to pay it.</v>

100
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Governments don't know how to collect </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

101
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we run the nhs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just do it directly?</v>

103
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.993
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of what was staggerIng was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the breadth of their </v>

104
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.534
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't see any limits on what they </v>

105
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>we had professor David Harvey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marxist professor in here,</v>

107
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.180
<v Speaker 1>and he says that sort of stitched into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideology of capitalism,</v>

108
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.014
<v Speaker 1>which obviously I need to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to reiterate for our listeners is </v>

109
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 1>the idea of infinite limitless growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like marxist theory,</v>

110
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>origin points out the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've got limited resources.</v>

111
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So inevitably capitalism will have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mast itself.</v>

112
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.624
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need a critical theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that continually exposes the fallacy of </v>

113
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>a model that as infinite growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was an amazing moment.</v>

114
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at disposal,</v>

115
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disposable consumerism and I mean,</v>

116
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:11.024
<v Speaker 1>you mean if you look at the way that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet is going in terms of limited </v>

117
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.504
<v Speaker 1>resources and what's ultimately going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers and you just make things that </v>

118
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>we throw away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stuff that we bought,</v>

119
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we buy cheaply.</v>

120
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>So the rise of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 1>the whole rise of high street riser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime art,</v>

122
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>tk maxx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these,</v>

124
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.984
<v Speaker 1>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these brands that basically produce </v>

125
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>goods that we could buy cheaply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at that moment,</v>

126
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around about 2000 and chemo has the very</v>

127
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>moment where global economies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to stagnate.</v>

128
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.623
<v Speaker 1>Wages are beginning to freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we'd had was 40 years of quote </v>

129
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:42.404
<v Speaker 1>unquote growth where prices rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so did wages in tandem with it at </v>

130
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly what happens,</v>

131
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.693
<v Speaker 1>wages freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's living standards can no longer </v>

132
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do?</v>

133
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>We make products that cost next to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

134
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>So people have the appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving living standards,</v>

135
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>but products just getting cheaper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>

136
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>And of course the price is paid by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

137
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And so this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are kind of the economics,</v>

138
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>underlying consumerism underlying where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are right now,</v>

139
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>who are the most powerful global </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

140
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk to be,</v>

141
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>or it used to be the oil companies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mining companies and uh,</v>

142
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and the retail and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and food unilever.</v>

143
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So unilever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsanto,</v>

144
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>nestlé,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coca cola,</v>

145
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>those companies run through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were the big ones.</v>

146
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's extraordinary,</v>

147
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.290
<v Speaker 1>oxfam did an amazing graphic where </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what they've done is taken the</v>

149
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.253
<v Speaker 1>600 or so biggest companies on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and then they've drawn their </v>

150
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>connections to the bigger company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>owns them.</v>

151
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.881
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

152
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:50.714
<v Speaker 1>is this extraordinary family tree which </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up with literally five companies </v>

153
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>running everything and you think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to believe in conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

156
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>just look at the graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

158
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:02.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

159
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.334
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to believe you conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories to understand that very few </v>

160
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>companies are in charge of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now in the last,</v>

161
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years,</v>

162
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>what we've seen is the rise of the tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

163
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know google,</v>

164
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>microsoft,</v>

165
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.313
<v Speaker 1>amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the companies that now people </v>

166
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:20.564
<v Speaker 1>consider to be the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies on the and are the most </v>

167
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>powerful because of what they own for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

168
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They'll own data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they own data,</v>

169
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>they own everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything there is to know about all of</v>

170
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.700
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so prospectively the most powerful it is</v>

171
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>saying that the way that we evaluate </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is changing.</v>

172
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:38.684
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily now about capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about potential power because of </v>

173
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data is the new oil.</v>

174
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Data is the new oil because the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

175
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the most precious commodity</v>

176
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>on the planet because if you own data </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you go to market specifically</v>

177
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>to people you can control them and</v>

178
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you control their consumer.</v>

179
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Got russell brand's house and russell </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand's houses.</v>

180
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.843
<v Speaker 1>Heating is controlled by a phone which </v>
<v Speaker 1>collects all the data and then collects </v>

181
00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:06.034
<v Speaker 1>all the data and what you buy collects </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the data and where you've been for </v>

182
00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:09.724
<v Speaker 1>the last 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know absolutely everything or will </v>

183
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:15.730
<v Speaker 1>know absolutely everything there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about you,</v>

184
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.710
<v Speaker 1>what you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

185
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.450
<v Speaker 1>what you liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you disliked,</v>

186
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.950
<v Speaker 1>that that is power.</v>

187
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.043
<v Speaker 2>Because what I heard is that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the word I heard that the uber </v>

188
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:28.660
<v Speaker 2>furcation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people will know that the way you,</v>

189
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 2>if once they know your habits and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns,</v>

190
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>then like that there could be a sliding </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale of,</v>

191
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a plumber,</v>

192
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 2>do you will it's christmas eve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a thousand pounds.</v>

193
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.184
<v Speaker 2>You could afford to pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you can have a kind of a flexible </v>

194
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:41.544
<v Speaker 2>capitalism that's responding to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer and extracting as much as </v>

195
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I suppose is,</v>

196
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that you seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest early jack,</v>

197
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.710
<v Speaker 2>is that without some oppositional force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limitless growth of corporatism will</v>

198
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:57.144
<v Speaker 2>devour everything and we're already at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where it's devouring the planet </v>

199
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.583
<v Speaker 2>itself and the traditionally we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine the opposing force to be </v>

200
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>provided by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the state has now become essentially</v>

201
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 2>the administrator for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for corporate is so that that opposition</v>

202
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:13.600
<v Speaker 2>won't be variety.</v>

203
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 1>What you've seen with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's not the first person to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

205
00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:17.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see brexit and trump,</v>

206
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you see in a kind of sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inarticulated response to the end of the</v>

207
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:23.464
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people wanting to take power </v>

208
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:28.360
<v Speaker 1>back because they can sense an end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't,</v>

209
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I mean?</v>

210
00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:30.574
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense in which the state has </v>

211
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.580
<v Speaker 1>lost its potency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

212
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Before we can articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it.</v>

213
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.520
<v Speaker 1>We know it's felt and people understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and so,</v>

214
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what someone says,</v>

215
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 1>w one entrepreneur said rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>chillingly and brilliantly to me,</v>

216
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:46.354
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do is we invent a problem and </v>

217
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:53.230
<v Speaker 1>then provide the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really what a lot of these</v>

218
00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:54.064
<v Speaker 1>products are about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about data and you talk </v>

219
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.194
<v Speaker 1>about the plumber and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you really want to do is you want </v>

220
00:10:58.001 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 1>to start giving people options that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>never knew they had what like.</v>

221
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.520
<v Speaker 1>if you watched this series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to like this series.</v>

223
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:08.800
<v Speaker 1>If you like that series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would want to go on this holiday.</v>

224
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:11.080
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go on that holiday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like to buy this car.</v>

225
00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:11.914
<v Speaker 1>If you want to buy this car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might like to go dating these 27 </v>

226
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:18.460
<v Speaker 1>different women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's an endless endless tree</v>

227
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.323
<v Speaker 1>that can be opened up in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your consumer decisions will be off the </v>

228
00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 1>back of one consumer.</v>

229
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.613
<v Speaker 2>It's and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're trapped on a plateau of </v>

230
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:28.574
<v Speaker 2>consumerism continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have another role in your </v>

231
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:32.624
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your role is to consume shopping is </v>

232
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.920
<v Speaker 2>everything because you know when George </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush was asked after nine slash 11,</v>

233
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.010
<v Speaker 2>what could the public do after nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 twin towers?</v>

234
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.510
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go shopping.</v>

235
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helping</v>

236
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.813
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a frivolous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grows shopping is actually what elon </v>

237
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 1>musk solution is to the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the automation.</v>

238
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.873
<v Speaker 1>He says that essentially the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do productive to the economy is </v>

239
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>spend money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumerism is what it's all based upon.</v>

240
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Debt is absolutely at the heart of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the.</v>

241
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.503
<v Speaker 1>So the increasing debt that we have goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand in hand with the need for us to </v>

242
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>continue buying stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you'll come to elon musk has</v>

243
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:13.890
<v Speaker 1>said will be paid a universal wage for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

244
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>for basically going shopping once robots</v>
<v Speaker 1>do everything,</v>

245
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.583
<v Speaker 1>robots will be taxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the money and then we'll go </v>

246
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 1>down to prime arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

247
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that is the future for humanity.</v>

248
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.133
<v Speaker 3>That george w dot bush moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's curious coming as it did off the </v>

249
00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:34.181
<v Speaker 3>back of a seismic event that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that represented in so many ways,</v>

250
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:38.360
<v Speaker 3>perhaps some unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cultural clash that,</v>

251
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's,</v>

252
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a response to.</v>

253
00:12:40.491 --> 00:12:45.491
<v Speaker 3>It was go shopping it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the modern equivalent of saying,</v>

254
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.410
<v Speaker 3>pray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and pray because that,</v>

255
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.333
<v Speaker 3>that is our ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is when we talk about extremism in </v>

256
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:56.180
<v Speaker 3>the more obvious forms of religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism,</v>

257
00:12:56.181 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 3>we seem unaware that the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremist ideologies,</v>

258
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 3>one where we are consumers and like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

259
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.620
<v Speaker 3>entering potentially into a time where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are nothing but a consumer.</v>

260
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this I think was interesting</v>

261
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:10.364
<v Speaker 1>is when we moved to online shopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that gonna do to the cathedrals </v>

262
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.820
<v Speaker 1>of consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:14.654
<v Speaker 1>the shopping centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these places where we go to worship the </v>

264
00:13:17.571 --> 00:13:18.404
<v Speaker 1>god of shopping because in a sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that replacement of god with shopping </v>

265
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.113
<v Speaker 1>has been with us for half a century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what we know and we're at </v>

266
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.840
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're shopping is a profound,</v>

267
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:30.674
<v Speaker 1>is a profound thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only profound in terms of how </v>

268
00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:33.674
<v Speaker 1>the economy operates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also profound in terms of what it </v>

269
00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 1>does neurologically to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:40.550
<v Speaker 1>we talk glibly about shopping addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retail therapy and so on,</v>

271
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but those feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that endorphin rush,</v>

272
00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that release of happiness that has to be</v>

273
00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:46.514
<v Speaker 1>replicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that addiction and you know about this </v>

274
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:48.861
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:49.694
<v Speaker 1>that addiction to that feeling has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicated faster and faster and more </v>

276
00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:57.500
<v Speaker 1>often and more often the shopping is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of who we are,</v>

277
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.250
<v Speaker 1>how we define ourselves in relation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our neighbors and our friends.</v>

278
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.700
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the heart of capitalism.</v>

279
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

280
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.463
<v Speaker 1>It's the way that we,</v>

281
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.520
<v Speaker 3>the way we see ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're not consuming,</v>

282
00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:10.050
<v Speaker 3>we're not existing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

283
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.060
<v Speaker 3>whilst I see the the economic analysis </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're conducting is the.</v>

284
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.900
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me is the truest way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding this problem.</v>

285
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 3>It's valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's demonstrable,</v>

286
00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.930
<v Speaker 3>it's scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go look,</v>

287
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.083
<v Speaker 3>this is where power is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at how it's responding to look at </v>

288
00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the decisions that are being made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this reality.</v>

289
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.983
<v Speaker 3>Look at these deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're living in this </v>

290
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:33.684
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way that's a way of tracing </v>

291
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:36.930
<v Speaker 3>it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of change,</v>

292
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.973
<v Speaker 3>it seems that we are very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>implement change on an economic level </v>

293
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:45.891
<v Speaker 3>because there isn't by definition or all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the power is held by people that want</v>

294
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:47.340
<v Speaker 3>to maintain these systems.</v>

295
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I think if you understand why they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the place it's in,</v>

296
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.063
<v Speaker 1>which was money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand how money is perhaps the </v>

297
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>only way that will get us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

298
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to peter teal who created paypal</v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies.</v>

299
00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>There's silicon valley billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

300
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.144
<v Speaker 1>the whole problem with the way we framed</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming has been in terms of a </v>

301
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>moral argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've put we,</v>

302
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've said to the public,</v>

303
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>this is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't care.</v>

304
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Daniel condom and the behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists said,</v>

305
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.900
<v Speaker 1>there's an extraordinary moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically when the,</v>

306
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 1>when a problem is too far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't deal with it.</v>

307
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 1>When it's too close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too late.</v>

308
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.563
<v Speaker 1>He said there's a window of opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>where something can be done and that's </v>

309
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 1>literally where we are with earth right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

310
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.730
<v Speaker 1>But you see the pizza go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza.</v>

311
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>What pizza tail was saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

312
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.713
<v Speaker 1>if there's money to be made from saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth that believe you me will have </v>

313
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 1>clouds with avn logos on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have cows with,</v>

314
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monsanto logos on them.</v>

315
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

316
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.963
<v Speaker 1>if that's what's required to sort the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth out is to find a way of making </v>

317
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>money from the salvation of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way forward.</v>

318
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's slightly bleak view.</v>

319
00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:59.740
<v Speaker 3>But another quote that recurs in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>program is,</v>

320
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.663
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to envisage the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world than the identity is invisible to </v>

321
00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:04.474
<v Speaker 3>the end of capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this economically will come before </v>

322
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.540
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemingly,</v>

323
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

324
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.833
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see how it can be amended </v>

325
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>through economic means unless you sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of started.</v>

326
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:17.694
<v Speaker 3>We uSe for a moment that touched on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are sort of biochemical </v>

327
00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:21.274
<v Speaker 3>imperatives to purchase and spending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing it because we get a feeling </v>

328
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.993
<v Speaker 3>inside our anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It within our consciousness for me that </v>

329
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.393
<v Speaker 3>the opposition can only change if people</v>
<v Speaker 3>start looking at reality in a very </v>

330
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:35.110
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think is being suggested.</v>

331
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.093
<v Speaker 3>The way that we intuitively understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nation state is ending or has </v>

332
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 3>already defunct except for in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>superficial way.</v>

333
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we,</v>

334
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.873
<v Speaker 3>we also know that huge change is </v>
<v Speaker 3>required outside of the systems that we </v>

335
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 3>currently live with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

336
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of a believer in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the economics myself.</v>

337
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed thomas pickety and a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an interesting guy,</v>

339
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the french economist in a wrote capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said to him,</v>

340
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.821
<v Speaker 1>this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what's to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he saId,</v>

343
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:06.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:07.920
<v Speaker 1>we corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>

345
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could create a global tax system.</v>

346
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:12.044
<v Speaker 1>We could create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could retool the imf and turn them </v>

347
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>into a force with teeth that could deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with corporate,</v>

348
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and I said that you're basically like </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for birds to go in.</v>

349
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

350
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:22.034
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is will we could have a </v>

351
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

352
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.674
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what way are we going to have a </v>

353
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:26.204
<v Speaker 1>revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the revolution is that you look </v>

354
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 1>at traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the russian revolution,</v>

355
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you can look at the failed 68 attempted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to revolution.</v>

356
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>What were they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the.</v>

357
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:34.783
<v Speaker 1>They were on the on an economic rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you had a prosperous middle class </v>

358
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:40.550
<v Speaker 1>that was demanding more what we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

359
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:41.001
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

360
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:41.834
<v Speaker 1>but what you have now is a potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>combustible force of a middle class who </v>

361
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.353
<v Speaker 1>are disenfranchised from what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe they're entitled to from the </v>

362
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:50.934
<v Speaker 1>last 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus an huge underclass of people who </v>

363
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.284
<v Speaker 1>literally cannot exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that together is a recipe for </v>

364
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.950
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what pickets.</v>

365
00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 1>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you know what you do have.</v>

366
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 1>What we do have in history is we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inevitability of change.</v>

367
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.813
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whatever we feel is now the </v>

368
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of the moment we're in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to change what,</v>

369
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>which way it's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

370
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:18.474
<v Speaker 1>But things are becoming more dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cycles are becoming more dramatic </v>

371
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and as Adam Curtis said in this film </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypernormalization,</v>

372
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.883
<v Speaker 1>we've normalized the catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a point where we accept that as part </v>

373
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 1>of the cycle and so that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing.</v>

374
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.213
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking more about revolution </v>

375
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:34.654
<v Speaker 3>towards the end of our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I emphasize and highlight now the </v>

376
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.623
<v Speaker 3>nature of this catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you explain to us what's happening </v>

377
00:18:43.091 --> 00:18:46.480
<v Speaker 3>within agriculture that demonstrates the</v>
<v Speaker 3>severity of the problem</v>

378
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have asked me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you.</v>

379
00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:51.974
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty extraordinary because the </v>

380
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.160
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have asked me that because</v>

381
00:18:55.161 --> 00:18:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to tell people what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

382
00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically the who did a report </v>

383
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.120
<v Speaker 1>two years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the backdrop,</v>

384
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of science that was being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the globe,</v>

385
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:11.084
<v Speaker 1>they'd put sort of put it in one place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they basically analyzed a lake in </v>

386
00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:15.494
<v Speaker 1>the of region of France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been undisturbed for a </v>

387
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.281
<v Speaker 1>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

388
00:19:22.281 --> 00:19:23.114
<v Speaker 1>They looked at the sediment in that lake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was any kind of really </v>

389
00:19:24.801 --> 00:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>interesting experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear with me on this.</v>

390
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.933
<v Speaker 1>what they found was the sediment had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been pretty much undisturbed up until </v>

391
00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:33.734
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then obviously things had started to </v>

392
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:37.124
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nature of the sediment have changed </v>

393
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.044
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what happened in the last 40 years </v>

394
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.320
<v Speaker 1>was that basically the nutrients had </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely depleted,</v>

395
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.430
<v Speaker 1>so as a result of intensive farming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive farming,</v>

396
00:19:49.431 --> 00:19:53.210
<v Speaker 1>not just to create wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to create basically animals and</v>

397
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:56.510
<v Speaker 1>dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For us to eat and consume.</v>

398
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.303
<v Speaker 1>We had leached the soil of all it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients resulting in the fact that we </v>

399
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:02.444
<v Speaker 1>have just 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They estimated 60 harvests left in the </v>

400
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:06.704
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

401
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.683
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of a sort of a food </v>

402
00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:10.450
<v Speaker 3>armageddon</v>

403
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 1>is approaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

404
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

405
00:20:13.631 --> 00:20:14.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people in silicon </v>

406
00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:16.691
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

407
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

408
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.880
<v Speaker 1>we're across this stuff because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and you say,</v>

409
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:23.680
<v Speaker 1>well in what way is an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synthetic soil,</v>

410
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.120
<v Speaker 1>vertical farming off I'm off world </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>

411
00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:29.650
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about the martian for </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

412
00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Could we turn the moon into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural place?</v>

413
00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Could we move all the heavy industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>into space?</v>

414
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what Jeff Bezos is plan is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.740
<v Speaker 1>this is the stuff that they're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with now.</v>

416
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago it was all tech.</v>

417
00:20:41.861 --> 00:20:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It was all silicon valley was all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into going into the micro,</v>

418
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.733
<v Speaker 1>the details of how a phone works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can a phone deliver as a computer </v>

419
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 1>now it's like looking out into space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All a super macro and that's where the r</v>

420
00:20:56.051 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and d is.</v>

421
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.513
<v Speaker 2>When I think about my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of evident that there is a </v>

422
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.263
<v Speaker 2>problem just from the way that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>share my own is aware of these kinds of </v>

423
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:05.044
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like when I figured my domestic </v>

424
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:07.090
<v Speaker 2>waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

425
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 2>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>passion weekend thrown away.</v>

426
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there is a detachment,</v>

427
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:16.441
<v Speaker 2>there is a lack of consciousness and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see how sort of this is a personal,</v>

428
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:17.554
<v Speaker 2>it's a personal problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one level and I think we feel hugely </v>

429
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:20.720
<v Speaker 2>disempowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

430
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put that in the recycling.</v>

431
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.333
<v Speaker 2>I'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I shouldn't do some more </v>

432
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:26.254
<v Speaker 2>composting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will in the face of these </v>

433
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels irrelevant.</v>

434
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:30.484
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that I'm learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must've disjunct in terms of power </v>

435
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>and what a theme that is between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal and the power.</v>

436
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I would get from what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just said,</v>

437
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 2>jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when they talk about,</v>

438
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

439
00:21:42.061 --> 00:21:42.894
<v Speaker 2>we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.390
<v Speaker 2>colonize the moon or whatever it is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

441
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.173
<v Speaker 2>It makes me realize how detached the </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful or from the lives of ordinary </v>

442
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.303
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you mentioned a moment ago that </v>

443
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 2>the combustible revolutionary engine </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be a a middle class,</v>

444
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.930
<v Speaker 2>which like a lot of people feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

445
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:02.764
<v Speaker 2>The privilege that they're entitled to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resources and comfort they're </v>

446
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:08.470
<v Speaker 2>entitled to is being eroded and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant on the class.</v>

447
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:13.471
<v Speaker 2>Now that on the class is as long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been nominated as disposable wherever it</v>

448
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:17.260
<v Speaker 2>was in colonization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery onwards,</v>

449
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:18.094
<v Speaker 2>perhaps even earlier than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a huge percentage of the </v>

450
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:22.430
<v Speaker 2>population that we simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do not care.</v>

451
00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are already machines.</v>

452
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And when we get better machines to </v>
<v Speaker 2>replace you,</v>

453
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can find a nice way of framing </v>

454
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:30.004
<v Speaker 2>genocide.</v>

455
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:31.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

456
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

457
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

458
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.153
<v Speaker 1>Paul Mason does a brilliant thing called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car wash paradox and it's basically </v>

459
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.670
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the car wash?</v>

460
00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:42.504
<v Speaker 1>The car wash in the 19 fifties was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing shining new piece of technology </v>

461
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.830
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

462
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:50.340
<v Speaker 1>it was going to automate fluffy buds </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come out and clean your car and it</v>

463
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:53.070
<v Speaker 1>will all look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened in the last five years,</v>

464
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.600
<v Speaker 1>car wash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years,</v>

465
00:22:54.601 --> 00:22:55.434
<v Speaker 1>car washes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started closing down right there in </v>

466
00:22:58.081 --> 00:22:58.914
<v Speaker 1>prime locations in the centers of cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can then be turned into luxury </v>

467
00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:03.354
<v Speaker 1>flats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these automated machines have </v>

468
00:23:05.671 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what has replaced them?</v>

469
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.443
<v Speaker 1>We're dead spaces on the outskirts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>town where you have immigrant labor or </v>

470
00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:16.020
<v Speaker 1>cheap labor doing the job that machines </v>
<v Speaker 1>would they.</v>

471
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one option,</v>

472
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machines had been made redundant by </v>

473
00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

474
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.510
<v Speaker 1>The difference being that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>have absolutely no rights.</v>

475
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.950
<v Speaker 1>They can be sat there and then and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing can be taken down in</v>

476
00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

477
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So that is one future that we might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

478
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.110
<v Speaker 1>The machines might not replace every </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

479
00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:37.500
<v Speaker 1>What might have is we might have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible moment and what we see on the</v>

480
00:23:37.501 --> 00:23:38.334
<v Speaker 1>news nightly as we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full employment employment's never been </v>

481
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 1>higher and yet they say also wages are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnating.</v>

482
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.053
<v Speaker 1>How can this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how these two things correlate the same </v>

483
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:48.314
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well would mean increase in part time </v>

484
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 1>work because of gig economy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

485
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 1>what you'll have is you'll have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at working for like delivery,</v>

486
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.760
<v Speaker 1>uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>so basically with no know were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited rights such as we decided,</v>

488
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

489
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a reversal of all of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were fought for in the last name</v>

490
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.330
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with no one working for any money so</v>

491
00:24:10.331 --> 00:24:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that he knows that the other future that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might have these,</v>

492
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.583
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are very radical changes to the </v>

493
00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:21.030
<v Speaker 1>structure of society and society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

494
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're doing is going back to.</v>

495
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.550
<v Speaker 1>We had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a period of stability from 1940,</v>

496
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.340
<v Speaker 1>roughly two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 the end of the nineties.</v>

497
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.250
<v Speaker 1>So what we're doing is going back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that previous period,</v>

498
00:24:32.251 --> 00:24:35.040
<v Speaker 1>a period of huge human instability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.770
<v Speaker 1>we call that that class the precariat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 1>we're all part of the precariat brick </v>
<v Speaker 1>area instead of.</v>

501
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being a prototype area,</v>

502
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate precarious class.</v>

503
00:24:46.231 --> 00:24:47.370
<v Speaker 1>The global class.</v>

504
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.923
<v Speaker 2>One of the themes that I've noticed over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of these podcasts is the way </v>

505
00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:55.380
<v Speaker 2>that power functions is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as best as possible,</v>

506
00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 2>more to facilitate its ongoing survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eg one slavery gets banned.</v>

507
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:02.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

508
00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:03.114
<v Speaker 2>what is the best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the closest we can approximate </v>

509
00:25:05.131 --> 00:25:07.260
<v Speaker 2>slavery without using that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

510
00:25:07.261 --> 00:25:08.094
<v Speaker 2>you could pay people next to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you give a sort of like that </v>

511
00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.034
<v Speaker 2>car wash example is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what concerns me when you use the </v>

512
00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:18.690
<v Speaker 2>silicone valley tech entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new sovereignty of these great,</v>

513
00:25:18.691 --> 00:25:20.850
<v Speaker 2>powerful corporations that now dominate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the globe,</v>

514
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.640
<v Speaker 2>is that in this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their utopia,</v>

515
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.773
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems of ordinary people are </v>

516
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:28.164
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mAtter that there is this </v>

517
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.960
<v Speaker 2>gray in more first underclass almost not</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter anymore.</v>

518
00:25:33.961 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Now almost a missed that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding up reality.</v>

519
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a kind of so much state of </v>

520
00:25:39.961 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 1>bliss which is kind of created by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>a mixture of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.350
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.213
<v Speaker 1>what you have is you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a mental health crisis in </v>

524
00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:50.454
<v Speaker 1>britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an unprecedented level of </v>

525
00:25:51.871 --> 00:25:52.860
<v Speaker 1>prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

526
00:25:52.861 --> 00:25:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed A gp in blackpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

527
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the depression capital of </v>

528
00:25:57.421 --> 00:25:58.680
<v Speaker 1>britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of said,</v>

529
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

530
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.120
<v Speaker 1>what did pharmaceutical drugs do here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do antidepressants do?</v>

531
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

532
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you could argue that they enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

533
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they do,</v>

534
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:09.210
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

535
00:26:09.211 --> 00:26:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they enable poverty?</v>

536
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:13.560
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a complex question,</v>

537
00:26:13.561 --> 00:26:17.790
<v Speaker 1>but it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be the case that,</v>

538
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially what are we doing?</v>

539
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Are we medicating people where they Can </v>
<v Speaker 1>endure otherwise unbearable conditions </v>

540
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.120
<v Speaker 1>and what is the consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:27.954
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the social and economic </v>

542
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:29.910
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that?</v>

543
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.983
<v Speaker 1>What are the consequences of obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has its correlation with </v>

544
00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.140
<v Speaker 1>what is the correlation with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of cheap,</v>

546
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:42.540
<v Speaker 1>what we call disparaging a cheap white </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods,</v>

547
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>the crash and the price of technology so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are aBsolutely addicted,</v>

548
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.110
<v Speaker 1>stuck to technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

549
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 1>when essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.850
<v Speaker 1>25 years ago that technology was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the,</v>

551
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.470
<v Speaker 1>beyond their economic bracket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't able to afford that stuff.</v>

552
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.543
<v Speaker 1>Now this is kind of these big questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not saying I have the answers </v>

553
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:03.114
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are the kinds of macro issues </v>

554
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 1>that we should be tackling and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not kind of separating off,</v>

555
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fats over here and it's unconnected to </v>

556
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 1>pop in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is unconnected to aspiration.</v>

557
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Everything is connected and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that he's connected.</v>

558
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a mental health crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the mental health crisis is excel.</v>

559
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.420
<v Speaker 2>If a result of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this economic paradigm,</v>

560
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.513
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's creating people that for whom </v>

561
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:32.700
<v Speaker 2>life is unbearable and instead of going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

562
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.740
<v Speaker 2>should we look at this economic model?</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply drug the people that</v>

563
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.430
<v Speaker 1>swing mental health and your and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your income.</v>

564
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean blackpool is the is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most depressed cities in britain also </v>

565
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.003
<v Speaker 1>has some the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a direct correlation between </v>

566
00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:51.520
<v Speaker 1>obesity and britain being the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>overworked,</v>

567
00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 1>underpaid country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those two things are not,</v>

568
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 1>not an accident,</v>

569
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.463
<v Speaker 2>but even beyond the income jack is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality of life that people are </v>

570
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:04.401
<v Speaker 2>living is if you are meaningless and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life is meaningless and you have no</v>

571
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:05.394
<v Speaker 2>value and you have no purpose and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>role in society is simply to consume </v>

572
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.893
<v Speaker 2>knowing that you consumed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are what you eat and what you eat a </v>

573
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:13.314
<v Speaker 2>disposable products and you are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disposable product that that's getting </v>

574
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:19.200
<v Speaker 2>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A huge existential crisis.</v>

575
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the image of like,</v>

576
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with a lawyer and </v>

577
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:27.390
<v Speaker 2>like all the evidence points to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a minute,</v>

578
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 2>it's causing a mental health crisis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just drug them.</v>

579
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 2>It's causing an ecological crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>

580
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

581
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:34.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you deal with the actual thing</v>

582
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:35.424
<v Speaker 2>of what you can't run life because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>profit making machine because it's a </v>

583
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:38.760
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>

584
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I think I see dead dead right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's a strong.</v>

585
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.713
<v Speaker 1>I think the struggle that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize they see capitalism as this </v>

586
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 1>monolithic evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

587
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.831
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

588
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 1>there's these companies are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>screw everyone over.</v>

589
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.823
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is the real struggle now is </v>

590
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:51.924
<v Speaker 1>not between workers and bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's between ceos of companies who </v>

591
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 1>genuinely want to bring about change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's poor.</v>

592
00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy who runs unilever and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

593
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:02.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

594
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.340
<v Speaker 1>what's your greatest achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

595
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of the hedge fund managers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of short money,</v>

596
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 1>short term profit motive within this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

597
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>We have to do something about global </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>

598
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.433
<v Speaker 1>When you speak to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talked like they are occupied or </v>

599
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:16.134
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel like they're the ceo of </v>

600
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:19.074
<v Speaker 1>a global corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the and and the reason why is </v>

601
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 1>because they know that government can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do paris,</v>

602
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.103
<v Speaker 1>paris climate changes of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government can't do this stuff and it's </v>

603
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 1>almost like they think no one else can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

604
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:30.954
<v Speaker 1>We've got the power we have to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggle of the future will be </v>

605
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.123
<v Speaker 1>business versus business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be the business visions of people </v>

606
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:39.324
<v Speaker 1>like mark zuckerberg who basically said </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially in that facebook thing that </v>

607
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:43.594
<v Speaker 1>he put up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to stand for president </v>

608
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>because now he's seen that trump can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>his version versus trump's version.</v>

609
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:50.363
<v Speaker 1>That's what you'll have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have competing business visions </v>

610
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:52.954
<v Speaker 1>of what the future should.</v>

611
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Except all of these people without human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are nothing.</v>

612
00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.330
<v Speaker 2>The results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ordinary people,</v>

613
00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.283
<v Speaker 2>unless someone can bypass that lets </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say that the reason that you're </v>

614
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:03.643
<v Speaker 2>engaged in this economic game is so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people can benefit and facilitate </v>

615
00:30:06.981 --> 00:30:10.520
<v Speaker 2>and the only way to change it is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disengage from the economic gain and the</v>

616
00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:11.354
<v Speaker 2>only way you're going to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is by finding and alternative to </v>

617
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.150
<v Speaker 2>making yourself feel better unless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like for me,</v>

618
00:30:17.151 --> 00:30:17.984
<v Speaker 2>this is where religion becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it's a model that </v>

619
00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:23.940
<v Speaker 2>exists outside economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was co opted by economics early.</v>

620
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

621
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.963
<v Speaker 1>Was it a surprise that religion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting back when we look at religion </v>

622
00:30:27.151 --> 00:30:30.540
<v Speaker 1>in various forms as being the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically there's no result,</v>

623
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.270
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no accident that Jihadism stands as</v>

624
00:30:33.271 --> 00:30:34.680
<v Speaker 1>a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as a,</v>

625
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.470
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of caliphate black flag </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

626
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.420
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't have to be the onLy </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

627
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:41.100
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather like trump,</v>

628
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.083
<v Speaker 1>it's an inarticulated slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>incohesive difficult to comprehend </v>

629
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.760
<v Speaker 1>version of an alternative</v>

630
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.030
<v Speaker 2>because fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on an emotional level,</v>

631
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.030
<v Speaker 2>fear and desire of fact that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational.</v>

632
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.370
<v Speaker 2>You where people are being kept in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational state,</v>

633
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

634
00:30:56.301 --> 00:30:57.134
<v Speaker 2>to perpetuate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consuming so fear and desire is </v>

635
00:30:59.361 --> 00:31:00.920
<v Speaker 2>basically what you're continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

636
00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:03.200
<v Speaker 2>These are irrational state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So irrational,</v>

637
00:31:03.201 --> 00:31:04.940
<v Speaker 2>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem attractive.</v>

638
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.961
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that trump was just deserts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

640
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.233
<v Speaker 2>if you feed people that information </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually jingoism tell people that </v>

641
00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 2>nothing has any meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually you will get this mba,</v>

642
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.573
<v Speaker 2>brexit at the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that the conditions were created </v>

643
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:19.200
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are the,</v>

644
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.140
<v Speaker 2>there are alternate alternate </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives.</v>

645
00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:21.974
<v Speaker 2>Even within this global context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in the example of </v>

646
00:31:24.201 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 2>China because they exist outside of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

647
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.580
<v Speaker 2>So can you tell us what this is?</v>

648
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

649
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the kind of,</v>

650
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.933
<v Speaker 1>we know we're not talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different corporations and you have put </v>

651
00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:36.030
<v Speaker 1>in running China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

652
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Russia plc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

653
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump like kind of failing chrysler of </v>

654
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:42.180
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:31:42.181 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 1>like some mid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid seventies corporation.</v>

656
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Then if you look at China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>china's quietly getting on with it.</v>

657
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:48.384
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting thing is they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>squared the circle of democracy and you </v>

658
00:31:52.231 --> 00:31:52.981
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

659
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:53.790
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.290
<v Speaker 1>when you go to davos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you hear,</v>

661
00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:56.124
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the meeting of the heads of </v>

662
00:31:57.451 --> 00:31:59.640
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every uBi annual meeting in Switzerland.</v>

663
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.400
<v Speaker 1>The endless debate is how does democracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in the way you know?</v>

664
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.423
<v Speaker 1>is democracy compatible with the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know as though democracy is in </v>

665
00:32:09.091 --> 00:32:09.924
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's endless discussion about </v>

666
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:14.310
<v Speaker 1>democracy being in crisis in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened in China,</v>

667
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they basically state tiananmen square </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

668
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.443
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a watershed because at that moment </v>

669
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.493
<v Speaker 1>it appeared as if democracy was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be the thing that the ruling </v>

670
00:32:28.291 --> 00:32:31.050
<v Speaker 1>party gave away to the middle class.</v>

671
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to do that.</v>

672
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.260
<v Speaker 1>What you need to do is you need to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>them consumer goods.</v>

673
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>You need to move them into being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirant.</v>

674
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.980
<v Speaker 1>We're middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a western middle class.</v>

675
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.933
<v Speaker 1>You can buy off any demands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and so China squared that </v>

676
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:48.074
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we make consumer goods available </v>

677
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.003
<v Speaker 1>in China?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to be the workshop of the west so </v>

678
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you know you'd always have light light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

679
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I have my made in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made in China.</v>

680
00:32:58.071 --> 00:32:58.904
<v Speaker 1>On the thing no longer now made it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's china's turn to be like the </v>

681
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:04.610
<v Speaker 1>west was and to become this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.533
<v Speaker 1>the largest market in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially we produce or africa or </v>

683
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.521
<v Speaker 1>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

684
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.354
<v Speaker 1>whoever decides to be come the workshop </v>
<v Speaker 1>for China produces cheap goods for </v>

685
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is the country that the planet now</v>

686
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:19.244
<v Speaker 1>pivots on.</v>

687
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.070
<v Speaker 1>China basically bailed out the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States after the,</v>

688
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.700
<v Speaker 1>after the subprime crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

689
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it's basically like a giant hsbc loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.040
<v Speaker 1>China is the bank and that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>loud.</v>

691
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that crash,</v>

692
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.100
<v Speaker 1>trying twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

693
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.973
<v Speaker 1>China is bailed out the us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means America is in debt to </v>

694
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:41.030
<v Speaker 1>China when you're talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret deals that govern the world.</v>

695
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.953
<v Speaker 1>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is happening on a net that is </v>

696
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>happening at the level of suffering or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least national states.</v>

697
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:47.384
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not always easy because because </v>

698
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 1>what you've got is you've got China are </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating like a,</v>

699
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.423
<v Speaker 1>like a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like your operation with a </v>

700
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.124
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

701
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.440
<v Speaker 1>like a highly successful corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

702
00:33:57.441 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is the chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this last,</v>

703
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.720
<v Speaker 1>actually this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they launched obo,</v>

704
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>which is their grand plan for the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet from bloody terrifying one</v>

705
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 1>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one road.</v>

706
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.273
<v Speaker 1>It's the recreation of the silk road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was basically trade route to the </v>

707
00:34:14.091 --> 00:34:14.924
<v Speaker 1>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade route that connects the </v>

708
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalized the planet.</v>

709
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 1>What they see is they see China creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new silk road,</v>

710
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but they're in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also see the unprecedented need for</v>

711
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 1>a power in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

712
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.960
<v Speaker 1>the pollutant aspects of what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen with growth.</v>

713
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.480
<v Speaker 1>They see that being dealt with by not by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unprecedented rise in,</v>

714
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.030
<v Speaker 1>in investment in global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

715
00:34:39.031 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

716
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.810
<v Speaker 1>in solar and wind power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they also,</v>

717
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a weird combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra frightening and ultra optimistic.</v>

718
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.093
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't know which way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know which way they're going </v>

719
00:34:50.891 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>to go and you don't quite know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>

720
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a combo of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two questions.</v>

721
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 1>One is how did they avoid them?</v>

722
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Ocracy Just fruit consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did they do?</v>

723
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Just basically the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.103
<v Speaker 1>tiananmen square marked was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a cataLyst in terms of our men </v>

725
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 1>who was a major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major plans on the street.</v>

726
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>The man would have shopping bags in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a tank,</v>

727
00:35:09.561 --> 00:35:11.130
<v Speaker 1>will never forget that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

728
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but how did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

729
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:13.824
<v Speaker 1>that people were demanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to be invite engaged in power </v>

730
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and spite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead it was like,</v>

731
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:17.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

732
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:18.524
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have,</v>

733
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but how do you actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that actually mean?</v>

734
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I think because how do you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

735
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way the,</v>

736
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

737
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.440
<v Speaker 1>China has a very deep seated with a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep rooted belief in the states,</v>

738
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.633
<v Speaker 1>in loyalty to the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual and the state being as </v>

739
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:36.250
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from this idea,</v>

740
00:35:36.251 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that doctrine of the mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an asian principle.</v>

741
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of dispute,</v>

743
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.330
<v Speaker 1>a dispute between you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not right.</v>

744
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the solution lies in the middle,</v>

745
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.420
<v Speaker 1>in a place that neither you nor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have thoughts.</v>

746
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the doctrine of the main is a,</v>

747
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

748
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a philosophy of how you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

749
00:35:58.111 --> 00:35:58.944
<v Speaker 1>how you deal with solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We come from a kind of completely </v>

750
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.670
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We come from the enlightenment,</v>

751
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 1>from the idea of a discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me putting my argument,</v>

752
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you put in your argument either your </v>
<v Speaker 1>right or I'm right,</v>

753
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 1>so it's combatative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.450
<v Speaker 1>which was the dialectic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

755
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So we come from a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

756
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sort of a spirit functional</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

757
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:18.903
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamentally part of what it is </v>

758
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 1>to be chinese is this notion.</v>

759
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would not have been,</v>

760
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.200
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't have been underwritten by </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of statehood initially.</v>

761
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 2>That would havE been sort of self and </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherness.</v>

762
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.860
<v Speaker 2>The original confusion.</v>

763
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.223
<v Speaker 1>Well the rice field being this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing to riceville being a </v>

764
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.290
<v Speaker 1>sort of symbol of the state so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grains of rice,</v>

765
00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I like the citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all part of the greater good of the</v>

766
00:36:45.491 --> 00:36:50.260
<v Speaker 1>state and that you understand that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>places as part of the state.</v>

767
00:36:50.261 --> 00:36:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have,</v>

768
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.833
<v Speaker 1>don't have that notion for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the notion that the hunter </v>

769
00:36:54.311 --> 00:36:55.870
<v Speaker 1>gatherer or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.500
<v Speaker 1>we haven't</v>

771
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 2>ritualistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

772
00:36:57.451 --> 00:36:58.970
<v Speaker 2>and individualistic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

773
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.233
<v Speaker 2>So China has sort of philosophical roots</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are gonna help them prevail that </v>

774
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.753
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of our identity myths of </v>

775
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:15.070
<v Speaker 2>individualism stitched into them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like how bay still pretty.</v>

776
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Presumably it's a stratified society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

777
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.950
<v Speaker 2>they've sort of diverted from any idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sort of equality.</v>

778
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's interesting isn't it?</v>

779
00:37:25.701 --> 00:37:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Because you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have already used,</v>

780
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you still have demands for rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have a middle class,</v>

781
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you still have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still.</v>

782
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.490
<v Speaker 1>The human beings will always demand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings do bond.</v>

783
00:37:34.491 --> 00:37:39.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the situation for China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not an expert on China,</v>

784
00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get one in,</v>

785
00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it'd be very interesting to hear what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to say about this,</v>

786
00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that the future for </v>
<v Speaker 1>China lies in there.</v>

787
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.280
<v Speaker 1>They're very cleverly avoiding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western route.</v>

788
00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't wAnt to take the route that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States to.</v>

789
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.753
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That became a super power and then went </v>

790
00:37:55.881 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 1>into decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

791
00:37:59.090 --> 00:37:59.923
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of that key to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying true to the philosophy and just </v>

792
00:38:04.521 --> 00:38:05.570
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

793
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 1>jumping has basically become a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate.</v>

795
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's given himself the highest accolade,</v>

796
00:38:12.351 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the new now.</v>

797
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So he's absolutely total total power </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the state.</v>

798
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:19.340
<v Speaker 1>He is the state</v>

799
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.253
<v Speaker 2>what he's trying his relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations then like they have the </v>

800
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.250
<v Speaker 2>image that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

801
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.083
<v Speaker 1>fascinatinG.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because if you </v>

802
00:38:27.621 --> 00:38:28.454
<v Speaker 1>look at how western corporations bend </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves towards the chinese market </v>

803
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.133
<v Speaker 1>because what they see is they see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest market on the world in the </v>

804
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how do we,</v>

805
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 1>how do we go into that market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>google that you see that they have their</v>

807
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 1>own versions of all the tech brands that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already have.</v>

808
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:46.804
<v Speaker 1>So to some degree do they need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they need to even have our tech </v>

809
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 1>brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't need to acres anymore.</v>

810
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Chinese have no sense of needing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight the west anymore,</v>

811
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing their own thing in gene </v>

812
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.183
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

813
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

814
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:04.120
<v Speaker 1>the gene editing that they're doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crispr benign stuff,</v>

815
00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:04.954
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically they absolutely </v>

816
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:08.540
<v Speaker 1>leading the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

817
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

818
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no sense in which I think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>patronizingly looked at China was like,</v>

819
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it going to develop,</v>

820
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:19.730
<v Speaker 1>how is it going to leap progress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

821
00:39:19.731 --> 00:39:20.564
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just think about the world in a </v>

822
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 1>different way from us.</v>

823
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I say it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a narrative that exists as a comparative</v>

824
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.110
<v Speaker 2>except from our perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their own original,</v>

825
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.003
<v Speaker 2>the ideology that is distinct and </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate and now I'm no longer needs to </v>

826
00:39:35.821 --> 00:39:39.600
<v Speaker 2>see itself in daily active discourse </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our western narrative.</v>

827
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.583
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to their own natures and your </v>

828
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:43.134
<v Speaker 2>motif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a self contained ideology </v>

829
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.553
<v Speaker 2>where the individual and the state can </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a harmonious relationship and this </v>

830
00:39:49.461 --> 00:39:51.870
<v Speaker 2>is going to be hugely beneficial for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them going forward.</v>

831
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.430
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that you said a moment ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

832
00:39:55.431 --> 00:39:56.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the combustible force of a growing </v>

833
00:39:57.481 --> 00:39:58.314
<v Speaker 2>underclass and dissatisfied middleclass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in gaging and </v>

834
00:40:03.481 --> 00:40:04.314
<v Speaker 2>understanding these forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that is interesting to me is </v>

835
00:40:08.341 --> 00:40:09.174
<v Speaker 2>with the diesel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this sort of a sort of recent </v>

836
00:40:11.581 --> 00:40:12.414
<v Speaker 2>attempt to reengage national identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the examples we've </v>

837
00:40:15.931 --> 00:40:16.531
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

838
00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:17.364
<v Speaker 2>brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stuff that's happening throughout </v>

839
00:40:18.301 --> 00:40:22.320
<v Speaker 2>europe and it's a aids I'm distilling to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

840
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.183
<v Speaker 2>These ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People marching in charlottesville </v>

841
00:40:24.161 --> 00:40:24.994
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to get what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that will want to reimpose a </v>

842
00:40:28.021 --> 00:40:30.240
<v Speaker 2>national identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get what they want.</v>

843
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.223
<v Speaker 2>The sort of source satisfaction and pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>will continue and many of the examples </v>

844
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:37.980
<v Speaker 2>that you've given across this show of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like health crisis,</v>

845
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:38.873
<v Speaker 2>agricultural crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all point to the power of these </v>

846
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:41.874
<v Speaker 2>transnational corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when people are saying what we want </v>

847
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.173
<v Speaker 2>is to condemn migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are simply another symptom of the </v>

848
00:40:50.221 --> 00:40:51.054
<v Speaker 2>problem that you have diagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you think we can engage the </v>

849
00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:01.100
<v Speaker 2>energy of the basically everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

850
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.990
<v Speaker 2>How do you direct that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you tell this story?</v>

851
00:41:03.991 --> 00:41:05.340
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you learned?</v>

852
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

853
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.083
<v Speaker 1>I make these series and I try to analyze</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as objective as possible how things </v>

854
00:41:13.651 --> 00:41:14.600
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

855
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.443
<v Speaker 1>how the world works and what people say </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me every single time is what are the </v>

856
00:41:20.551 --> 00:41:23.160
<v Speaker 1>solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your solution to this,</v>

857
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.263
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a way that is enough that people </v>

858
00:41:26.941 --> 00:41:27.774
<v Speaker 1>ask that question because we're at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment where we can't talk about </v>

859
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:32.364
<v Speaker 1>revolution in the 20th century way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't talk about people going to the </v>

860
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:37.754
<v Speaker 1>barricades and deciding that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take over the post office or </v>

861
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:43.260
<v Speaker 1>something that isn't going to happen.</v>

862
00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 1>We're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to a space where,</v>

863
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:50.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

864
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:50.864
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that thing that you mentioned </v>

865
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>earlier about the supermicro and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>super macro.</v>

866
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:55.783
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we laugh when we put stuff in our </v>

867
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>recycling bin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

868
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I went to detroit and went to camden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

869
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the most poverty stricken </v>
<v Speaker 1>system was crime ridden city in America.</v>

870
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 1>People are moving there because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>super cheap.</v>

871
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like basically you've got people </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting up businesses like you know,</v>

872
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.164
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're growing vegetables in their </v>

874
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.503
<v Speaker 1>front door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something kind of laughable and </v>

875
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:21.044
<v Speaker 1>laudable and brilliant at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>about people just doing stuff for </v>

876
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:25.694
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a kind of millennial </v>

877
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:28.743
<v Speaker 1>generational sort of reaction to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you've got to be on twitter </v>

878
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:35.180
<v Speaker 1>and facebook and whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly,</v>

879
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of almost like a progressive</v>

880
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:38.520
<v Speaker 1>luddite.</v>

881
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Autism or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

882
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

883
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the kind of techno prairie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said,</v>

884
00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on the techno prairie.</v>

885
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:46.400
<v Speaker 1>We're all got wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm growing carrots.</v>

886
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>

887
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's going to be 50 different</v>

888
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 1>strains of rebellion against the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the hell the system is,</v>

889
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it'll take the form of those</v>

890
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>guys who have just bought one inch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump wall.</v>

891
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:01.454
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today they've decided to buy a meter of </v>

892
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:04.904
<v Speaker 1>the ground where trump plans to build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall across Mexico and they've said </v>

893
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make it legally </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for him to do.</v>

894
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So that is a clever lateral way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebelling.</v>

895
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's what human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are doing all the time.</v>

896
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to buy south the a kind of present</v>

897
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

898
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I try to basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

899
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.493
<v Speaker 1>the franchise was up for southeastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>railways was most failing british </v>

900
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:31.100
<v Speaker 1>railway and the commuters have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable time.</v>

901
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.173
<v Speaker 1>I said to the bbc and the communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we try and run the railway </v>

902
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 1>ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we bid for the franchise?</v>

903
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>We put together a bit just from all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are on the train.</v>

904
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:46.270
<v Speaker 1>You had expertise on the train of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had nurses,</v>

905
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>care workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountants,</v>

906
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.573
<v Speaker 1>every conceivable a hedge fund managers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every conceivable person brought </v>

907
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>together for the purposes of a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

908
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And the department of transport turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>it down just simply because we weren't.</v>

909
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.990
<v Speaker 1>They said we hadn't gone through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hoops,</v>

910
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:03.824
<v Speaker 1>but essentially we put together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible plan which was then taken on </v>

911
00:44:07.141 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 1>board by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's kind of the future.</v>

912
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Thinking laterally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking differently,</v>

913
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:12.884
<v Speaker 1>connecting with people in unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and who the hell knows what will </v>

914
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:17.384
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

915
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.273
<v Speaker 2>Revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose is taking your power back is </v>

916
00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:22.420
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have my power.</v>

917
00:44:22.421 --> 00:44:23.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to defer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to subscribe to other </v>

918
00:44:25.061 --> 00:44:25.894
<v Speaker 2>peoples ideas and systems and whether it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a growing vegetables on a tech now </v>

919
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.213
<v Speaker 2>prairie or to participate economically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this sense that you have authority </v>

920
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:36.954
<v Speaker 2>and authorship of your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something you said earlier about the </v>

921
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:39.984
<v Speaker 2>cic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was themselves sort of wanting to </v>

922
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:42.714
<v Speaker 2>resolve these problems I find quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiring because all of these systems </v>

923
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:46.464
<v Speaker 2>and ideas are built upon people and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>resourced by people and require people </v>

924
00:44:50.161 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 2>in order to pop to perpetuate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

925
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.800
<v Speaker 2>And what that makes me think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jack is that the.</v>

926
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>If you can buy what people are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

927
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.970
<v Speaker 2>like the ass end of this neck in </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants,</v>

928
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.863
<v Speaker 2>in blackpool and in bad salty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugary food and buying crap disposable </v>

929
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 2>goods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They trying to feel good.</v>

930
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.603
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to feel happy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that they are trying to process </v>

931
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 2>these feelings through to no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide for them.</v>

932
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that what you said,</v>

933
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.330
<v Speaker 2>like the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.550
<v Speaker 2>there'll be 50 different ways that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

935
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the how is not important.</v>

936
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's important is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just start to,</v>

937
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:27.624
<v Speaker 2>that you started,</v>

938
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very middle class.</v>

939
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:31.094
<v Speaker 1>I hate people in a way who are engaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>in politics because to me it's quite a </v>

940
00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:37.250
<v Speaker 1>bourgeois kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an,</v>

941
00:45:37.251 --> 00:45:41.000
<v Speaker 1>it's quite an interesting thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>even think we have the luxury of sitting</v>

942
00:45:41.001 --> 00:45:42.800
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we are discussing these things.</v>

943
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.843
<v Speaker 1>Most people are just trying to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you buy a bag of chips after having </v>

944
00:45:47.001 --> 00:45:47.834
<v Speaker 1>done a 16 hour shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't give a toss about global </v>

945
00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:52.064
<v Speaker 1>economics or corporations and sewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want one thing you want is what </v>

946
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you said is you want your life to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

947
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And it sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you know,</v>

948
00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.813
<v Speaker 1>changing your life and doing it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro level is kind of revolutionary </v>

949
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.100
<v Speaker 1>because that's what matters to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what matters.</v>

950
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It seems abstract because in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses,</v>

951
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in infinite space,</v>

952
00:46:10.941 --> 00:46:13.070
<v Speaker 2>but we also live in camden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

953
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:17.680
<v Speaker 2>The idea of infinite space or the globe </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all be abstract.</v>

954
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's nice that we know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is we live in ourself.</v>

955
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:23.740
<v Speaker 2>We live in our community and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have different relationships at that.</v>

956
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.400
<v Speaker 1>That's really community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

957
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.731
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

958
00:46:25.731 --> 00:46:26.564
<v Speaker 1>when I was in the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I had this sort of slightly </v>

959
00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:31.970
<v Speaker 1>without sounding too weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to kind of epiphany moment where I</v>

960
00:46:31.971 --> 00:46:32.804
<v Speaker 1>was sort of in the street and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>like drug dealers cavorting around on </v>

961
00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 1>like chilled children's bikes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

962
00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just sofas in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

963
00:46:39.771 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:41.803
<v Speaker 1>it's like a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the wire but for real and </v>

965
00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this guy and he was like,</v>

966
00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.940
<v Speaker 1>he was busking and he was like on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>street corner and I had a lollipop.</v>

967
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.953
<v Speaker 1>It had broken up guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he put put tape on and he was </v>

968
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.140
<v Speaker 1>using the lollipop as a plectrum and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

969
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.273
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna give you like an </v>

970
00:46:59.811 --> 00:47:00.644
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to give you money like </v>

971
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the most depressed place in the world.</v>

972
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.500
<v Speaker 1>He was giving it a go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

973
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:07.970
<v Speaker 1>He was like giving a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

974
00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 1>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you walk down a street,</v>

975
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.240
<v Speaker 1>any street in britain or anywhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you see 50 businesses,</v>

976
00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:15.074
<v Speaker 1>some of which will fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which are and it's like all of </v>

977
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:17.954
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had some crazy idea to start a </v>

978
00:47:19.641 --> 00:47:20.474
<v Speaker 1>business and they've had a go and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's something sort of </v>

979
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.080
<v Speaker 1>inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about the idea of people.</v>

980
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Then utilizing that spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human spirits to survive,</v>

981
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but then doing something together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who was in new in camden in New</v>

982
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.723
<v Speaker 1>Jersey said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason we moved here is because of </v>

983
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

984
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 1>we feel connected to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

985
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 1>We are all together trying to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community work.</v>

986
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 1>We're employing local people employed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke to the guy,</v>

987
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 1>worked and worked and he said I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent be dead.</v>

988
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 1>He was drug dealer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer for 20 years.</v>

989
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 1>He ended up getting a job for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

990
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:56.010
<v Speaker 1>this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

991
00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I would 100 percent be debt if these </v>
<v Speaker 1>2:19</v>

992
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:02.520
<v Speaker 1>year olds haven't come here and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>this print works and you think,</v>

993
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.990
<v Speaker 1>and he and they and they were only </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiring people from,</v>

994
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.853
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that side,</v>

995
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe rebuilding community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we have in britain?</v>

996
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>We have isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>

997
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 1>atomize people who don't know their </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>

998
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:12.874
<v Speaker 1>don't know anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old people who live in solitary lives </v>

999
00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:15.844
<v Speaker 1>and unconnected to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Building community is really at the </v>

1000
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 1>heart of what could happen.</v>

1001
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.360
<v Speaker 3>We unthinkingly submit our ingenuity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a preexisting system that has I hot,</v>

1002
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.960
<v Speaker 3>not as you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a machiavellian intent,</v>

1003
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 3>but just as it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking emma,</v>

1004
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.513
<v Speaker 3>our subjugation it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So immediately you say our business is </v>

1005
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.463
<v Speaker 3>gonna make money in order to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other problem built in is that </v>

1006
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 3>we still try to use sort of state </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions.</v>

1007
00:48:42.521 --> 00:48:43.354
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state will prevent transnational </v>

1008
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:45.071
<v Speaker 3>corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1009
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 3>we now know that can't happen except in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

1010
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:50.710
<v Speaker 3>but it has an entirely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropological origin.</v>

1011
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.820
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to me that what a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I.</v>

1012
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:54.903
<v Speaker 3>This is the bloody thing that's all for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that prevents me from being simply </v>

1013
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:02.941
<v Speaker 3>a narcissist is the I deeply deeply care</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are suffering in this way,</v>

1014
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.480
<v Speaker 3>is something about it makes me very </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappy and furiously angry.</v>

1015
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I kind of believe it's possible for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change that.</v>

1016
00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must do is you want to ask around,</v>

1017
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 3>make noise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries.</v>

1018
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:14.224
<v Speaker 3>Would you put yourself ruled out buddy </v>
<v Speaker 3>grief when you could be shopping the </v>

1019
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 3>misses and your mother In law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is.</v>

1020
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.823
<v Speaker 1>We all care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just that everyone cares </v>

1021
00:49:24.031 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 1>because we human beings aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see a woman who run coca cola said to</v>

1022
00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:27.870
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1023
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said to me,</v>

1024
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1025
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's accused the company of creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity and so on,</v>

1026
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high fructose corn syrup and all the</v>

1027
00:49:38.131 --> 00:49:39.930
<v Speaker 1>rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she turned to me and she said,</v>

1028
00:49:39.931 --> 00:49:40.920
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did all that.</v>

1029
00:49:40.921 --> 00:49:41.754
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what we were going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know that was going to be the </v>

1030
00:49:43.561 --> 00:49:45.060
<v Speaker 1>end result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she turned to me.</v>

1031
00:49:45.061 --> 00:49:46.590
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a mother.</v>

1032
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.263
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to say because she was sort of </v>

1033
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.470
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a human being.</v>

1034
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Please be reminded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am human,</v>

1035
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I understand the consequences of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

1036
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to hope that that's,</v>

1037
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1038
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:03.800
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1039
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Like remind yourself this because like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1040
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 3>a minute ago you said that thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1041
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:08.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

1042
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:09.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've found this 16 hour shift </v>

1043
00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:12.470
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably are going to just have some</v>

1044
00:50:12.471 --> 00:50:13.880
<v Speaker 3>chips and not think about or listened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1045
00:50:13.881 --> 00:50:14.714
<v Speaker 3>The russell brand podcast they use is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you should be doing for him to </v>

1046
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:17.403
<v Speaker 3>actually making it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a scaffold the police or </v>

1047
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:20.083
<v Speaker 3>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel connected to sort of </v>

1048
00:50:25.041 --> 00:50:25.874
<v Speaker 3>abstract ideological ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is like your primary </v>

1049
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:30.644
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be able to see a of coke or a </v>

1050
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 3>scaffold that is that I'm a father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a brother,</v>

1051
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sister,</v>

1052
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:39.150
<v Speaker 3>a daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I don't like know.</v>

1053
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because we do these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to be talking about brexit</v>

1054
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:42.704
<v Speaker 3>or wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think brexit don't impact my life </v>

1055
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 3>as much as some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daughter might have said this morning</v>

1056
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 3>or my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we humans,</v>

1057
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 3>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in human lives.</v>

1058
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:52.424
<v Speaker 3>These are ideological things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as they're not impeding on our </v>

1059
00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be kept in the abstract.</v>

1060
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:57.663
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the only way to do that is </v>

1061
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:58.851
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gosh,</v>

1062
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 3>this is may seem somewhat bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>reductive given who I'm talking to you,</v>

1063
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:07.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's to somehow replicate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communal unit.</v>

1064
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.993
<v Speaker 3>But we would tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if unimpeded by post agricultural </v>

1065
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:16.510
<v Speaker 3>ideological forms that benefit elites </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inhabit and subjugate ordinary.</v>

1066
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 1>That connotes really spot on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense often thing,</v>

1067
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:21.494
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I often think about the kind of </v>

1068
00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:29.000
<v Speaker 1>freud in emotional underpinning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism.</v>

1069
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You know how everything is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1070
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.290
<v Speaker 1>They really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even these,</v>

1071
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.930
<v Speaker 1>even like we're all sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gareth's not saying a word,</v>

1072
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting over up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a kind of like,</v>

1073
00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:41.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a sort of dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a kind of really nuanced,</v>

1074
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 1>psychological dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you,</v>

1075
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of getting on.</v>

1076
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:48.380
<v Speaker 1>But he could have gone badly and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been,</v>

1077
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 1>it could have like it could have rested </v>
<v Speaker 1>on one thing you said or something.</v>

1078
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely tiny tiny decisions that</v>

1079
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:57.044
<v Speaker 1>can have massive implications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think if you applied that to </v>

1080
00:51:59.631 --> 00:52:00.464
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you applied that to the decisions that </v>

1081
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:06.230
<v Speaker 1>corporations make whereby you appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanity of people.</v>

1082
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.213
<v Speaker 1>You deal with people on an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and I've seen this actually does </v>

1083
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:11.264
<v Speaker 1>have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of overplay the hard money side </v>

1084
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 1>and we underplay the weird emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological side</v>

1085
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.373
<v Speaker 3>because both of those things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>resourced by the prime or the desire to </v>

1086
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.780
<v Speaker 3>gain resources has a prime or engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like I feel that </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophically is psychologically.</v>

1088
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1089
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.360
<v Speaker 3>that you want to navigate people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1090
00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.493
<v Speaker 3>to their cradle and their deathbed </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually like you were born once and </v>

1091
00:52:38.411 --> 00:52:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you were going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's,</v>

1092
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.370
<v Speaker 3>let's accept that basis and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions from there.</v>

1093
00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:43.323
<v Speaker 3>Not continually in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm the ceo and by wednesday we've </v>

1094
00:52:46.661 --> 00:52:48.520
<v Speaker 3>got a pie chart or whatever it is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have now.</v>

1095
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:49.301
<v Speaker 3>Is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1096
00:52:49.301 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>take these people that come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ludicrous maxims and ideas and all</v>

1097
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:55.540
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so an opportunity that the,</v>

1098
00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:57.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth's only got 60 harvest in it.</v>

1099
00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1100
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:58.391
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1101
00:52:58.391 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot,</v>

1102
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why the reason that I am </v>

1103
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:06.880
<v Speaker 3>interested in religion is not because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of a bizarre cultural artifacts</v>

1104
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.723
<v Speaker 3>of the cruise as a result of its time of</v>
<v Speaker 3>origin or the ludicrous prejudice that </v>

1105
00:53:11.461 --> 00:53:11.980
<v Speaker 3>one flies.</v>

1106
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.813
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because it's dealing with the </v>

1107
00:53:13.811 --> 00:53:16.330
<v Speaker 3>fundamental you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>

1108
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.223
<v Speaker 3>You've experienced things that seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be very similar from what other people </v>

1109
00:53:19.241 --> 00:53:20.074
<v Speaker 3>are experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we build systems on that basis and </v>

1110
00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 3>because I suppose there are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between.</v>

1111
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.063
<v Speaker 3>It seems that what we require our </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities that are of a certain size </v>

1112
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual members of that community</v>

1113
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:35.180
<v Speaker 3>have power within that community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other communities are earnouts to be</v>

1114
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.033
<v Speaker 3>run according to their own values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the idea of that being on a </v>

1115
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 3>national level these days is finished </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's too many people to do it.</v>

1116
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:43.884
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the state no longer has the </v>

1117
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 3>legitimacy of being the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>defends us from the,</v>

1118
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the barbarians,</v>

1119
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:53.350
<v Speaker 3>whether those are corporate barbarians </v>
<v Speaker 3>or barbarians that are outside of our</v>

1120
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty hundred per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like aristotle.</v>

1121
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.461
<v Speaker 1>Lillian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1122
00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 1>You're basically saying you're making an</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for the greek polis,</v>

1123
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.773
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the city state a state that </v>

1124
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 1>aristotle said hat to have a defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary in terms of its size,</v>

1125
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.440
<v Speaker 1>number of inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it to work economically.</v>

1126
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 1>It could only work at this scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any bigger.</v>

1127
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It becomes corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes destroyed.</v>

1128
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting,</v>

1129
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:18.030
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far have we come?</v>

1130
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.213
<v Speaker 3>That is the argument I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a bit even smaller than </v>

1131
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.250
<v Speaker 3>eight because of a chimps can only </v>
<v Speaker 3>handle 75.</v>

1132
00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:30.251
<v Speaker 3>People say it's like an arab city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1133
00:54:30.951 --> 00:54:33.110
<v Speaker 3>under the skin is finally reached the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>

1134
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a city full of chimps scratching </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1135
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.220
<v Speaker 3>picking stuff out of each other's hair </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing things that chimps do.</v>

1136
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:41.323
<v Speaker 3>So your book a don,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the secret deals that are changing the </v>

1144
00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:00.234

<v Speaker 3>in your front garden that actually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seed was made by monsanto and it's </v>
