1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.980
<v Speaker 1>My accent changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible,</v>

2
00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>may bounce up and down that class ladder</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little trees,</v>

3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:05.244
<v Speaker 1>football in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm around like sort of like </v>

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend really torments me for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much I love working class men.</v>

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when we went to think it was called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewsons to pick up some gravel.</v>

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry that that's my life.</v>

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.103
<v Speaker 1>And there's this bloke there called mark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came over and wanted to fight </v>

9
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.504
<v Speaker 1>ots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You laughed at that episode when it a </v>

10
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.073
<v Speaker 1>photo and I was not a lot and I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodbye to him in an overly elaborate </v>

11
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I even wave to him a second time for</v>

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>another apartment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cherry out the window.</v>

13
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I think I might turn off,</v>

14
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but you don't sit at my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

15
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I taught our pal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good solid of Alpha power.</v>

16
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>The tomato sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidestar.</v>

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Bloody Cockney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely ridiculous.</v>

18
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why we change our voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more we know this study,</v>

21
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>we have to change our voices to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So soon as we started talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other without agreeing to do so,</v>

23
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.803
<v Speaker 1>we started to breathe together because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that is have a </v>

24
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.324
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to coordinate how you breathe </v>

25
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>because that lets you time voices going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth,</v>

26
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>the turn taking conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So physical,</v>

27
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also matched the pros,</v>

28
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>the pitch and precedent by voices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rhythm of our voices.</v>

29
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>We start to bring together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got this very rhythmic.</v>

30
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.804
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a dance conversation and you </v>

31
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 1>can only do that dance if you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>align your behavior.</v>

32
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>So that has to happen to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the more you like someone,</v>

33
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>the more you will start to do other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

34
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>to change your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring it towards them.</v>

35
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So there are studies that have shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the more a man likes a woman,</v>

36
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>well he will raise the pitch of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice to be nearer to hers,</v>

37
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.973
<v Speaker 1>just notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's super self conscious </v>

38
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:42.894
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

39
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.023
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

40
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And you believe that you'll start to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same words.</v>

41
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.594
<v Speaker 1>You start to use the same pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>jeep and start to use the same grammar </v>

42
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>as each other and the and the more you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

43
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.634
<v Speaker 1>The most communication is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of it is that </v>

44
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make a connection with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

45
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to defy the material prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our anatomy.</v>

46
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling trapped and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

47
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>This thing that is not really holy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly Uba vibration emanating from you.</v>

48
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.023
<v Speaker 1>That is your misery that you've sent out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world to make connections and </v>

49
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:15.594
<v Speaker 1>communication with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at this and I'm just making </v>

50
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>this shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always there.</v>

51
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's always expressing like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that you don't realize and it's also</v>

52
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.194
<v Speaker 1>expressing how you feel about the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking to fairly </v>

53
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.284
<v Speaker 1>unavoidably.</v>

54
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.153
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start watching myself back </v>

55
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>on track because one day Sundays we do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of funny bit in my standup show,</v>

56
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:32.844
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I talk about when we did this </v>

57
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that we make jokes about,</v>

58
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean me because.</v>

59
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.843
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider myself for about nine people </v>

60
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>might actually have people at work with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her in the room I'm like,</v>

61
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.123
<v Speaker 1>is that I love about how I go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different personas when dealing </v>

62
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>with Jeremy Paxman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start very light and affable.</v>

63
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:54.504
<v Speaker 1>Then I got really serious and then I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sort of either deliberately or not </v>

64
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
<v Speaker 1>deliberately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unconsciously referencing ethnic </v>

65
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.640
<v Speaker 1>speak rhythms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.703
<v Speaker 1>very working class based because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously see myself as speaking on </v>

67
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>behalf of outsiders and I use it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack technique.</v>

68
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting to watch and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing because we can mark similarity</v>

69
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can mark difference because.</v>

70
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

71
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm definitely not try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go.</v>

72
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I knew I'd have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

73
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

74
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like ridiculous.</v>

75
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like a grime single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

76
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.673
<v Speaker 1>It's still playing your apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes marking out your position to </v>

77
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.110
<v Speaker 1>him as clearly and how you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

78
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like,</v>

79
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't particularly want to be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

80
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling my cell phone.</v>
