<v Speaker 2>White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so powerful on wherever there is any way</v>

30
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 2>mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really nice to talk to you now.</v>

31
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 2>This is one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those ones were like,</v>

32
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know each other,</v>

33
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 2>but we've had quite a good chat before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast started,</v>

34
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 2>haven't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a very good chat.</v>

35
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We plunged right in with the nature of </v>

36
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 2>reality as experienced through computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>

37
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.184
<v Speaker 2>which pretty good place to start because</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things with this point in </v>

38
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:05.674
<v Speaker 2>this podcast is to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to university doing this </v>

39
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and global politics.</v>

40
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It may make gave me a thirst and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement.</v>

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 2>That knowledge I've always been proud </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

42
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>My is in the Noyce or I learned that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean and then actually I've learned some</v>

43
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:19.511
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think no,</v>

44
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really good to distill and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and have some of the language</v>

45
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:23.884
<v Speaker 2>of academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the point of interest is you </v>

46
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this book Selfie?</v>

47
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.713
<v Speaker 2>I've just read a brief intro and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously understand what the modern </v>

48
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.314
<v Speaker 2>term means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want people to get from </v>

49
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.164
<v Speaker 2>reading that book?</v>

50
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>What it is is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

51
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it's the story of the Western self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it's doing is saying that,</v>

52
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

53
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.093
<v Speaker 1>in our modern culture we're surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by this image of the perfect self and </v>

54
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a really particular kind of odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

55
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It's this person in their twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this fat stomach and they kind</v>

56
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>of are very entrepreneurial and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of globally minded and they kind of</v>

57
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.064
<v Speaker 1>look a certain way and act a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really sort of telling the </v>

58
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>who is this person and and kind of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

60
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.523
<v Speaker 1>how did it come to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you reckon that's come from </v>

61
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>classicism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:06.904
<v Speaker 1>So I think the story really begins for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me two and a half thousand years ago in </v>

63
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:10.504
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greece and I was really amazed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by this whole body of psycholo </v>

64
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.843
<v Speaker 1>psychological research I came across </v>
<v Speaker 1>that talks about this idea of the </v>

65
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
<v Speaker 1>geography of thought and it's this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that who we are as a people is very much</v>

66
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>a product of all.</v>

67
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.503
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was geography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in ancient Greece is a code really </v>

68
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.533
<v Speaker 1>particular an unusual place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like a nation of what you </v>

69
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.343
<v Speaker 1>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just acts like 100 individual city </v>

70
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 1>states and there was a very particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecology and ancient Greece.</v>

71
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.643
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've been to Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it's mountains descending to </v>

73
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.654
<v Speaker 1>see a little rocky islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you couldn't do in ancient </v>

74
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Greece was you couldn't be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer,</v>

75
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>like in East Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like big,</v>

76
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>big irrigation projects as big rice </v>
<v Speaker 1>grain projects.</v>

77
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>So to get along and get ahead of it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

78
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yet at the same time in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in East Asia,</v>

79
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you had to be a part of a collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

81
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>But in ancient Greece it was different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dsp,</v>

82
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>a hustler because there was no big </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

83
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be a potter or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

84
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>to make olive oil or to be a fisherman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

85
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and so you had to be yet to sort of push</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself forwards.</v>

86
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.933
<v Speaker 1>And the other kind of ramification of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being so coastal was that they started </v>

87
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.984
<v Speaker 1>trading with all these other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they began sharing ideas and </v>

88
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>coming across sort of new and novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

89
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of encourages is this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of debate?</v>

90
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>So debate was like a big thing you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and,</v>

91
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

92
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.353
<v Speaker 1>the ecology forms this kind of way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being this kind of individualistic way </v>

93
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>of seeing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from that comes all these ideas</v>

94
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>what is a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a human is,</v>

96
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.804
<v Speaker 1>this kind of individual node of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential perfection and destiny rather </v>

97
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>than us being a collective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.001
<v Speaker 1>part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:45.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

100
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>just one could have node in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective reality.</v>

101
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So you see interesting things in ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece beginning,</v>

102
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's the myth of Narcissus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very relevant today,</v>

103
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.833
<v Speaker 1>but things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they venerate celebrity do the myth of </v>

104
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 1>narcissus just in case people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

105
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know nothing about.</v>

106
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.463
<v Speaker 1>And it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to me for anything </v>

107
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>because a pretty good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's say in ancient Greece that,</v>

108
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

109
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.883
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

110
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>they had this kind of version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity and they would tell you know,</v>

111
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these great myths and one of one of them</v>

112
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.224
<v Speaker 1>has courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got narcissists who fell in love </v>

113
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:16.504
<v Speaker 1>with his own own image and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you get literally then it is </v>

114
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>reflection and then fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

115
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.930
<v Speaker 1>this kid is lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd like to get in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>snuggle him.</v>

117
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And then did he drown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think he drowned?</v>

118
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>In a way it's stupid like not to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and it was like a moment ago and</v>

120
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing those earrings and that top</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put on reflection,</v>

121
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.193
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose the point of a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that noise that we were in </v>

122
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>this place where there's continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>

123
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.743
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a metaphor like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's as opposed to the point of </v>

124
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:51.574
<v Speaker 1>that myth is about how it's easy to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost in the self and to make this self </v>

125
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>

126
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

127
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek myth,</v>

128
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
<v Speaker 1>because it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was this whole environment where the </v>

129
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>individual was seen as this node of kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of possibility.</v>

130
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>And so I contrast this in Selfie with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in,</v>

131
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in East Asia at the time.</v>

132
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And that was the land of Confucius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to get along and get ahead in,</v>

133
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>in East Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to,</v>

134
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be part of this sort of big group.</v>

135
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And their idea of the perfect stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally opposite to the aristotle.</v>

136
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:23.950
<v Speaker 1>He notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

138
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>the idea of somebody who seeks notoriety</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

139
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.003
<v Speaker 1>was known as the inferior self and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior self doesn't seek that </v>

140
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>notoriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and so that,</v>

141
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>that all feels like ancient history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is ancient history,</v>

142
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.803
<v Speaker 1>but it's all really relevant today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when these psychologists do these </v>

143
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>studies on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Westerners versus East Asians,</v>

144
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>they say that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally see the world in,</v>

145
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>in a different way.</v>

146
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you put a Westerner in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.253
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show a video of a fish tank for </v>

148
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>three seconds and then the front of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish tank because this very flashy show,</v>

149
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>offy narcissistic kind of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.753
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a bloody good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's that and then monitor the movement </v>

152
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.213
<v Speaker 1>of your eyeballs every millisecond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they find is that if you're a </v>

153
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.904
<v Speaker 1>westerner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will pretty much be studying that </v>

154
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>individualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic fish at the front.</v>

155
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>But if you're from East Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

156
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I will be constantly moving and judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the context.</v>

157
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So they're literally seeing the world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way.</v>

158
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And this has major ramifications even </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to how we take selfies.</v>

159
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

160
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.533
<v Speaker 1>when they study the content of selfies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>East Asian selfies are much more likely </v>

161
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>to be a big group of mates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big gang of people together.</v>

162
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>But Western self is a much more focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the individual narcissistic face.</v>

163
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.533
<v Speaker 1>So huge sort of huge ramifications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it all begins with the ecology of </v>

164
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>our people 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I just found extraordinary.</v>

165
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that story.</v>

166
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.153
<v Speaker 2>That's a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think about that little show </v>

167
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 2>of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop thinking about him.</v>

168
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I want to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sounds like a right little,</v>

169
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.283
<v Speaker 2>lovely name getting more out if me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have tried to track my own movements </v>

170
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.174
<v Speaker 2>that have gotten always looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's putting his hand in the fish tank </v>

171
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 2>kitchen named Caitlyn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in his own name,</v>

172
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 2>he took it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might come back yet.</v>

173
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.240
<v Speaker 2>And that to follow me on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CCTV footage just darted off.</v>

174
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.733
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that we think of as the </v>

175
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 2>central such as our attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism are themselves constructs.</v>

176
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.924
<v Speaker 2>And you can trace historical narratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we added me near that Yanis </v>

177
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Varoufakis you couldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever.</v>

178
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 2>He said one of the things he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well sure,</v>

179
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:25.154
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying it myself ever since </v>

180
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

181
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I don't credit him with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

182
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says you guys,</v>

183
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.984
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we exist in dialectic dialectically </v>

184
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>existing conversation with others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

185
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's even in my standup now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

186
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one is a good bit.</v>

187
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I talk about the notion of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 2>how can you individually exist without </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

189
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

190
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.250
<v Speaker 2>like any years actually Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

191
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found,</v>

192
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 2>like the tradition of democracy within </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason come out of grace,</v>

194
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:53.914
<v Speaker 2>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing I think about when he </v>

195
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>was talking about the itemized</v>

196
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.610
<v Speaker 1>and entrepreneurial society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which fate,</v>

197
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>individualism also had slavery in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be craft bloody lazy path.</v>

198
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We about two and a half thousand years </v>

199
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So democracy.</v>

200
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still wasn't right.</v>

201
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a narrow as bullying number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men that could vote for that.</v>

202
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>It was only 50 years at democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

203
00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a bit of a flash in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pan,</v>

204
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.154
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it came to existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for that narrow range of news was </v>

205
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty extraordinary because </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of that in these days though.</v>

206
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Fifty years you'd think when you're like</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years ago now the sixties,</v>

207
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>that's like the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

209
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if something,</v>

210
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>if we create some sort of utopia that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasted for 50 years,</v>

211
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.223
<v Speaker 1>it was a denim democratic utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But regardless of what you're saying is </v>

212
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that the crucible of individualism as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard it,</v>

213
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:42.264
<v Speaker 1>started there with this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition that we can contrast to a </v>

214
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.953
<v Speaker 1>different tradition and that to this day</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see even in simple prosaic </v>

215
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.083
<v Speaker 1>example such as a Selfie or people bug </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of show off fish and also a major </v>

216
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

217
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Richard Nisbett,</v>

219
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.730
<v Speaker 1>who's the professor kind of studies this</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a pioneer of this guy,</v>

220
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 1>said to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

221
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China for example,</v>

222
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea of somebody suffering unfairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the benefit of the group is far more</v>

223
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:09.624
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To us that's a horrific human rights </v>

224
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:11.994
<v Speaker 1>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more acceptable in that </v>

225
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>culture because they privileged the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group over the individual.</v>

226
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also bad effects.</v>

227
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sample of someone's suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the group.</v>

228
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of the human rights abuses that,</v>

229
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.870
<v Speaker 1>the communist dictator mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

230
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't mind it,</v>

231
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:27.894
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're much more prepared to kind </v>

232
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:30.460
<v Speaker 1>of tolerate abuse.</v>

233
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.733
<v Speaker 1>They privileged the group and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a Japanese anthropology </v>

234
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 1>talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:38.244
<v Speaker 1>the culture in Japan that a CEO of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company might commit suicide if they've </v>

236
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:42.234
<v Speaker 1>let the company down and that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen as an honorable act in Japan still </v>

237
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

238
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least he killed himself.</v>

239
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>He did the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's almost a cliche though,</v>

240
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't it like a kamikaze idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of slightly different,</v>

241
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's less prevalent today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you mentioned her,</v>

242
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.223
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that it's still secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still going to generally understood as </v>

243
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 1>to understand why you would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had even in informal parties,</v>

244
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.300
<v Speaker 1>if she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

245
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.133
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll introduce yourself to somebody </v>

246
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:07.801
<v Speaker 1>who's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

247
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm so nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

248
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't say I'm David.</v>

249
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And then it comes up in conversation a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit later on that you work for Sony.</v>

250
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.071
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

251
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:14.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sony's David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of the group is much more </v>

252
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.413
<v Speaker 1>front and center in their consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>on David by either look at more new </v>

253
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.874
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

254
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You can always that shrimp salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's for everybody.</v>

255
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>And we in the lot of way work for Sony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here.</v>

256
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That's aristotle and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And then why would you identify with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate entity?</v>

258
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:37.944
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you do think that capitalism does </v>

259
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it means that because everything is</v>

260
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 1>stripped and made it into an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>model that people don't feel any sort of</v>

261
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:44.694
<v Speaker 1>sense of purpose or identification other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than their own individual sort of </v>

262
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.743
<v Speaker 1>identification with themselves because </v>
<v Speaker 1>communal values have been sort of </v>

263
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>radically and dramatically broken down </v>
<v Speaker 1>over time to lose.</v>

264
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>We think of ourselves as consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That becomes our role.</v>

265
00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Got No social order would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story that handily,</v>

266
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.400
<v Speaker 1>that Selfie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely so,</v>

267
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

268
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.843
<v Speaker 1>so the beginning of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we begin with how the ecology led to a </v>

269
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>certain way of being an introduce.</v>

270
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.683
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the foundational idea with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and that is that when we're </v>

271
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.154
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if the brain asks at one </v>

272
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 1>fundamental question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

273
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:15.454
<v Speaker 1>who do I have to be in this environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get along and get headed in </v>

274
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:18.934
<v Speaker 1>this tribe that I'm in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are sort of various </v>

275
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>interesting sort of neuro biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happen.</v>

276
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain kind of calms itself down as a</v>

277
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>function called neural pruning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're actually carved itself down,</v>

278
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:29.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of meet the culture that it </v>

279
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>finds itself immersed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're right,</v>

280
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>during the middle part of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

282
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>it was actually much more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective time in the West in both,</v>

283
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a time of welfare state.</v>

284
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It was a time of unionization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a time of a regulation on banking</v>

285
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.070
<v Speaker 1>or businesses job for life.</v>

286
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And what sprang out of that environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the hippies,</v>

287
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.113
<v Speaker 1>we had this very communalistic worldview</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you compare who we were in 1965 </v>

288
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 1>to who we became in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 20 years,</v>

289
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that's half a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute transformation in who,</v>

290
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.673
<v Speaker 1>who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened right in the middle of </v>

291
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:04.924
<v Speaker 1>those dates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neoliberalism Thatcher and Reagan came </v>

292
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:07.450
<v Speaker 1>along and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

293
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.283
<v Speaker 1>forget all this collectivization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this interview that you did in </v>

294
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:10.954
<v Speaker 1>1981.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really quite sinister where the stipend </v>

295
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>senator Tom said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

296
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Thatcher,</v>

297
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your plans,</v>

298
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

299
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.820
<v Speaker 1>things made me kind of very cross about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our policies for the last 30 years.</v>

301
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.683
<v Speaker 1>It'd been very collective and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bring back individualism and </v>

302
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing there,</v>

303
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but what then what you said is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object is sort of method is economics,</v>

304
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but the object is to change the soul.</v>

305
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.530
<v Speaker 1>She wanted sinister and it's especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's exactly what she did.</v>

306
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't both though the economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the object is the truth.</v>

307
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret.</v>

308
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean not actually as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a character that you don't just</v>

309
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>look at people with detached from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual reality of what they historically</v>

310
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:52.444
<v Speaker 1>did and just sort of think of him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character because like Margaret </v>

311
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.543
<v Speaker 1>Thatcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mum had said he had to write a poem </v>

312
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>about Alliance for state the windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that de facto state funeral.</v>

313
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he looked at videos to inspire </v>

314
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 1>him and he said that when you watched it</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of think,</v>

315
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.133
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant because he's so forceful </v>

316
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.773
<v Speaker 1>and powerful and very opposite of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incipient managerial technocrats that </v>

317
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:11.644
<v Speaker 1>find themselves in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>government today with the notable </v>

318
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 1>notable exception of Donald trump.</v>

319
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.240
<v Speaker 1>But so like there was a clip that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

320
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:19.074
<v Speaker 1>that is a curious observation that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a sort of an agenda to change the </v>

321
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:27.000
<v Speaker 1>way the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that relationship with society out in</v>

322
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.100
<v Speaker 1>a central level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

324
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously she had no understanding of</v>

325
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>this rich and visit work because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't happened yet,</v>

326
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>but she was absolutely right in what she</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

327
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it happens really quickly.</v>

328
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.393
<v Speaker 1>So in 1992,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find is something really weird </v>

329
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>happening in our maternity wards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for generations,</v>

330
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>parents called their children by Richard</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Margaret,</v>

331
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.433
<v Speaker 1>like ordinary names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly you get parents finding </v>

332
00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:50.404
<v Speaker 1>unusual and distinctive and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy names for their kids because they </v>

333
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:54.570
<v Speaker 1>want their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their words are,</v>

334
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>the psychologists have found this out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand out and be a star is the beginning</v>

335
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>of the keep fit revolution and then by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the atheists we have the,</v>

336
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 1>we have the Yuppies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

338
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we start changing because who we have</v>

339
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:06.464
<v Speaker 1>to be in order to get along and get head</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been redefined by neoliberalism of </v>

340
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:09.944
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near near liberalism is this idea that </v>

341
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to gamify all of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

342
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are human life into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive competition of self first itself</v>

343
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of the welfare state as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

344
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.133
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of the unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all that red tape is they </v>

345
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:23.804
<v Speaker 1>called it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has to look after themselves </v>

346
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we find today.</v>

347
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

348
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.120
<v Speaker 1>young people are these very ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek nodes of individual profit and all</v>

349
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.240
<v Speaker 1>their brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their entrepreneurial,</v>

350
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda Thatcher's wet dream in a </v>

351
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disturbingly,</v>

352
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.523
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what we see today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking about Margaret </v>

353
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Thatcher having a way to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about the clammy of Maggie </v>

354
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.823
<v Speaker 1>Smash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.920
<v Speaker 2>And I like don't dislike the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest with you,</v>

356
00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:54.480
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it.</v>

357
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I may revisit that Meryl Streep film the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iron Lady with this in mind.</v>

358
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.590
<v Speaker 2>She's dreaming of millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's who those are,</v>

359
00:16:01.591 --> 00:16:03.660
<v Speaker 2>the people that are in that dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you.</v>

360
00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:03.961
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

361
00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:04.794
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you talked about the plasticity of </v>

362
00:16:05.581 --> 00:16:06.414
<v Speaker 2>the mind prune in itself to be opera </v>
<v Speaker 2>bull in whatever context it finds </v>

363
00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 2>herself in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they're,</v>

364
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:14.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a 50 years be a sort of a period</v>

365
00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:15.564
<v Speaker 2>of a democratic blip in ancient Greece </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the journey from collectivism to </v>

366
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.853
<v Speaker 2>massive individualism from the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 2>to present day is a small period of </v>

367
00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:23.910
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

368
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.773
<v Speaker 2>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't you reckon that is in right </v>

369
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.973
<v Speaker 2>about really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll be able to turn people nicest </v>

370
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.230
<v Speaker 2>pie</v>

371
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.750
<v Speaker 1>shake of title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think there are,</v>

372
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.320
<v Speaker 1>there are causes for optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the book or you know,</v>

373
00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write about sort of trump and brexit.</v>

374
00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I know we don't think about those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of optimism usually,</v>

375
00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of connect those with the rise of</v>

376
00:16:45.301 --> 00:16:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Corbin because I think what we're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the beginnings of a mass rebellion.</v>

377
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Against</v>

378
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.593
<v Speaker 2>neoliberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it be a handsome young Jeremy </v>

379
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Corbyn yourself in that moment saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh thank you.</v>

380
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that as a copay picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be a video of asked.</v>

381
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.380
<v Speaker 2>See to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

382
00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a couple of minutes and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

383
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 2>well I started to like about Jeremy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Corbyn was that it was still and sort of</v>

384
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.324
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

385
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 2>before all of the sort of hubbub of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh,</v>

386
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 2>the election and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 2>their various leadership campaigns </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the Labor Party.</v>

388
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.183
<v Speaker 2>There was an idea that it was a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuddy duddy and you can see that sharp </v>

389
00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>and him up suit wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like an hair cut by Zambia dwis.</v>

390
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.273
<v Speaker 2>But now I like is this sort of stillness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when he's on things being sort of </v>

391
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:23.114
<v Speaker 2>badgered and berated that he has a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like he's been through it so many </v>

392
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.150
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like it.</v>

394
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidently it is what I felt like,</v>

395
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is a corollary between trump </v>

396
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and corbin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's authenticity,</v>

397
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 2>that these are both people that feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine and like there's an integrity.</v>

398
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 2>We talked to Naomi Klein and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

399
00:17:41.211 --> 00:17:42.044
<v Speaker 2>but Donald Trump's at massive liar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a brazenness to Donald </v>

400
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something brazen that like,</v>

401
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>compared to the light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hillary Clinton never all</v>

402
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.963
<v Speaker 1>crap politician he's going on about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a bomber is the founder of Isis </v>

403
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.070
<v Speaker 1>that's fairly brazen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

404
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.980
<v Speaker 1>This anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright be prejudiced.</v>

405
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

406
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

407
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.213
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we forget to do sometimes in all </v>

408
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>our re outrage about Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually look at what he was saying.</v>

409
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So what he was saying during that </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign was,</v>

410
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build a wall with Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to make apple put a </v>

411
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>factory in Wisconsin and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

412
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Bannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his right hand man was going.</v>

413
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.473
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The middle class in America was built </v>

414
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:22.140
<v Speaker 1>the middle class in Asia and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

415
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

416
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>so what he was mounting was an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>against globalization.</v>

417
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he campaigned on.</v>

418
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 1>And of course globalization is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neoliberal projects.</v>

419
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:30.864
<v Speaker 1>What nearly was want is to create off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world one single perfect global </v>

420
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

421
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a right wing person with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>right ring brain and you are fed up with</v>

422
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.103
<v Speaker 1>neoliberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be what you're thinking </v>

423
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>about is globalization is immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

424
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these foreigners coming in here and </v>

425
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>knocking our wages down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a left wing person looking</v>

426
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.194
<v Speaker 1>at exactly the same problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be looking in a </v>

427
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be looking at regulation.</v>

428
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 1>We need more regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to cut this inequality.</v>

429
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 1>We need to sort out these terrible house</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>

430
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.820
<v Speaker 1>We need to cut student debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

431
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 1>so it feels to me like these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these big political earthquakes,</v>

432
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.463
<v Speaker 1>a terrible cliche that have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are both responses to the same problem </v>

433
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>just but from opposite ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum.</v>

434
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.800
<v Speaker 1>There are our responses against </v>
<v Speaker 1>neoliberalism.</v>

435
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 1>So I really do feel that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

436
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.670
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the tumultuous beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big period of world revolution in,</v>

437
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 1>in our lifetimes.</v>

438
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.973
<v Speaker 1>The worrying thing is that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such different worldviews </v>

439
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 1>attacking the same problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a period of conflict.</v>

440
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.413
<v Speaker 1>I think new worldviews are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge because I would like to defy </v>

441
00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 1>those taxonomies and systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization.</v>

442
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.663
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could occur because information can be </v>

443
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>liberated so rapidly now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible.</v>

444
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Will that tells me a little bit for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on one of my rant.</v>

445
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 1>It looks a little bit about what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying about like,</v>

446
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:46.914
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bogus self esteem revolution and </v>

447
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.004
<v Speaker 1>it's reappropriation of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious and spiritual principles to </v>

448
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 1>tell me what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the heart,</v>

449
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the heart of Selfie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a big,</v>

450
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.053
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long investigation into the self esteem </v>

451
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:01.440
<v Speaker 1>movement because this is what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem and movement.</v>

452
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:02.131
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

453
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:02.964
<v Speaker 1>it says this idea engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out of the human potential </v>

454
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 1>movement of the sixties and seventies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

455
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.480
<v Speaker 1>So in all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

456
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 1>s comes out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it actually begins.</v>

457
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.583
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This'll institute in big Sur in </v>

458
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:16.560
<v Speaker 1>California where I actually went in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there actually.</v>

459
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there for the book.</v>

460
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go and do a big sort of.</v>

461
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 1>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A course?</v>

462
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:21.684
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever do a work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in a really nice hotel down the </v>

463
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:25.120
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>

464
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.003
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing down there and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember seeing her and Adam Curtis </v>

465
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:28.524
<v Speaker 1>documented truffle archival look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there to have a look at them and </v>

466
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't doing anything else.</v>

467
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 1>they have that yoga workshops without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did what this course called the Max,</v>

469
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 1>which was this horrific kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about finding your authenticity,</v>

470
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:42.684
<v Speaker 1>but it's very similar to the workshops </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing in the sixties and </v>

471
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:46.014
<v Speaker 1>seventies a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was all business ideas of human </v>

472
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.164
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

473
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.483
<v Speaker 1>What was going on in the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies when it was being in the </v>

474
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 1>screaming at your own genitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:56.194
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tell these horrific Thursday note </v>

476
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan,</v>

477
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.563
<v Speaker 1>they called them encounter groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the I say so it's like imagine sort </v>

478
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>of big brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

479
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.490
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

480
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.400
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much more intense,</v>

481
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:07.383
<v Speaker 1>you'd be shot in a room for hours and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours name with complete </v>

482
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 1>strangers and your job is to be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest as possible to that stranger.</v>

483
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had nervous breakdowns,</v>

484
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:15.874
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous breakdown when you sit down </v>

485
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:17.464
<v Speaker 1>nearly at one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I start saying little things </v>

486
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.354
<v Speaker 1>going in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be locked up because it's too much </v>

487
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:21.630
<v Speaker 1>going on in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

488
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 1>But the but the reason they thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good idea,</v>

489
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.863
<v Speaker 1>it's important when stands because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this big revolution in America </v>

490
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for generations back through Freud,</v>

491
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back through all of Christianity,</v>

492
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the idea of what a human being is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human being is bad.</v>

493
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>There's original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Eda was complex,</v>

494
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 1>we are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in poster America,</v>

495
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 1>this guy called Carl Rogers comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has this new idea.</v>

496
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

497
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

498
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fantastic.</v>

499
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 1>They're full of latent potential and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we need to do to.</v>

500
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just turns out of nowhere,</v>

501
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>a few minutes of brilliant where he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely influential,</v>

502
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

503
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.663
<v Speaker 1>whereas you getting a bloody sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>backbone from how come you can come out </v>

504
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:03.890
<v Speaker 1>with such a contrary point and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

505
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 1>no trouble as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always said was he got,</v>

506
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

507
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes out of the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

508
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in postwar America,</v>

509
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the economy was changing mat massively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a big exodus of people from</v>

510
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 1>the country into cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

511
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 1>women were now in the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the workforce,</v>

512
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:22.840
<v Speaker 1>much more following the second world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

513
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So it was the era of Corp Man of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suburbia or revolutionary road.</v>

514
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's a much more optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality focused time.</v>

515
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.540
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

516
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.373
<v Speaker 1>it's always economy that underpins these</v>
<v Speaker 1>big changes in it and the big social </v>

517
00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:35.494
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that the reason that </v>

518
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.144
<v Speaker 1>that may have had sort of tacit </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevancy because both the projects of </v>

519
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.084
<v Speaker 1>urbanization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporatization and mass </v>

520
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 1>industrialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all turning people into a bloody</v>

521
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:44.494
<v Speaker 1>great big lump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need an accompanying myth of </v>

522
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 1>individualism as a sort of tonic so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get through your job.</v>

523
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Were you doing bugger all in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism is reduced to me.</v>

524
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy this phone if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without laughing.</v>

525
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.863
<v Speaker 1>Which I think the historical kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional historical theory about how </v>

526
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 1>the world changes is a bit wrong for </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly those reasons is,</v>

527
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.250
<v Speaker 1>is that they tell that crazy story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody comes along with a new idea and</v>

528
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.240
<v Speaker 1>everybody's fluxing goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

529
00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a great new idea.</v>

530
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have new ideas all the time,</v>

531
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:12.034
<v Speaker 1>but what we choose the person who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that feels right and it feels </v>

532
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>right because our economy is in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>

533
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

534
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.633
<v Speaker 1>it's the environment that changes first </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we kind of lock onto somebody </v>

535
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>who has an idea that feels kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthy.</v>

536
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So this was Carl Rogers and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

537
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.250
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

538
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.253
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like this guy that kind of </v>

539
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 1>had this new idea that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why encounter groups came.</v>

540
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.173
<v Speaker 1>He pioneered encounter groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that in order to become </v>

541
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:37.150
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to kind of,</v>

542
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach this kind of inner core or as </v>

543
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>perfect as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as perfect as are potentially artists to</v>

544
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:44.490
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so from a selling something in that,</v>

545
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.670
<v Speaker 1>that there will like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.613
<v Speaker 1>like going on a journey of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery and honesty would be useful </v>

547
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>for an individual.</v>

548
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

549
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:53.091
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

550
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a couple of problems with it</v>

551
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is the is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 1>what is the authentic self is this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if we just strip away or the,</v>

553
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 1>or the planet has a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

554
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

555
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the society layers upon us that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this perfect in a cell that we know that</v>

556
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 1>isn't true in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

557
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 1>that there is no such thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic self with the,</v>

558
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 1>with the big caveat that we do have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct personality,</v>

559
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.950
<v Speaker 1>a biogenic kind of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

560
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

561
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.383
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how did these ideas come to the self </v>

562
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:25.300
<v Speaker 1>esteem movement of the Nineteen 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]?</v>

563
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 1>So John Vasconcellos was this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful California politician who,</v>

564
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew Carl Rogers and corrosion,</v>

565
00:24:32.761 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 1>it's got sort of mentor to him and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties and the,</v>

566
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:36.044
<v Speaker 1>in the neoliberal is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had kind of a kind of near liberal </v>

567
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of remix of these excellent ideas.</v>

568
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>So he decided that he called self esteem</v>
<v Speaker 1>is social vaccine.</v>

569
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 1>He literally thought it was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine that we'd all take self esteem,</v>

570
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the self esteem medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

571
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and cocaine stay medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

572
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you'd done your job.</v>

573
00:24:56.251 --> 00:24:57.140
<v Speaker 1>But that's what he thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

574
00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 1>he thought the self esteem was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cure homelessness,</v>

575
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.910
<v Speaker 1>domestic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

576
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.220
<v Speaker 1>in a teenage pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug abuse,</v>

577
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

578
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:06.914
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was going to make us more </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive contestants in this great </v>

579
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>near liberal game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

580
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:11.480
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

581
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 1>he was the second most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician in California.</v>

582
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And he proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sets up this three year task force to</v>

583
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 1>investigate self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

584
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these scientists to,</v>

585
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.380
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

586
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>to prove that there was a causative link</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

587
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 1>that if we give people high self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will become more perfect.</v>

588
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.480
<v Speaker 1>That become better near liberal kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contestants in how happier and healthier</v>

589
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fast forward three years he tells the</v>

590
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

591
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 1>The scientists agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem as a social vaccine.</v>

592
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 1>That is an amazing transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning.</v>

593
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's laughing at this idiot from </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

594
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:43.364
<v Speaker 1>like this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's literally a national direct Johnny </v>

595
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Carson's cracking jokes about this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the tonight show.</v>

596
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

597
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a laughing stock,</v>

598
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but then it comes out with his news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

599
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.173
<v Speaker 1>I've got these seven University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>California professors to study the data </v>

600
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and they've backed me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self esteem is a social vaccine and he's</v>

601
00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:01.780
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he's big.</v>

602
00:26:01.781 --> 00:26:02.614
<v Speaker 1>He's flown to the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has talked to the communists about self </v>

603
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.980
<v Speaker 1>esteem is an oprah talking about self </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>

604
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:07.814
<v Speaker 1>And then of course I'll protect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets hold of the idea and it goes </v>

605
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He becomes this kind of celebrity.</v>

606
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that goes around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it changes everything.</v>

607
00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way we raised our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

608
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It changes the way we teach our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

609
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>It's that whole era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think we both grew up in.</v>

610
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 1>All of your wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're special,</v>

611
00:26:23.121 --> 00:26:23.954
<v Speaker 1>you're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a Rosetta for coming 14th place in </v>

612
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:28.034
<v Speaker 1>the sports day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you see in the psychological </v>

613
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:34.210
<v Speaker 1>data is from the 19 no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

614
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Narcissism starts going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

615
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So we start raising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising a generation of children who are</v>

616
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.630
<v Speaker 1>more narcissistic year by year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

617
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the kind of cohort that came before </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

618
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's the selfie </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

619
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.693
<v Speaker 1>These are the millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I do in the book is I go </v>

620
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:50.814
<v Speaker 1>back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a year investigating John </v>

621
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.273
<v Speaker 1>Vasconcellos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's since died and his taskforce and </v>

622
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean investigator down </v>
<v Speaker 1>taskforce members I went to.</v>

623
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a big archive in Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selfish all their documents.</v>

624
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.223
<v Speaker 1>I've got all their documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got audio recordings of their </v>

625
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it.</v>

626
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing because what some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew was that there was a,</v>

627
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.620
<v Speaker 1>there was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That data didn't kind of say what Fastco</v>

628
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Fast Evan Got Invesco Oakland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vasco,</v>

629
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vasco said it said,</v>

630
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but I tracked down one task force member</v>
<v Speaker 1>who described the whole operation in his</v>

631
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:23.940
<v Speaker 1>words is a fucking lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

632
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.643
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said I was in a room with it and now </v>

633
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.633
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a room with vascular when he </v>

634
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:30.114
<v Speaker 1>saw the scientific reports for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and he said if the legislature who </v>

635
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.913
<v Speaker 1>fund them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if ledger to see what's in the reports </v>

636
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:38.670
<v Speaker 1>are going to shut our task force down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said from that moment on,</v>

637
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:39.504
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing got covered up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's incredibly consequential </v>

638
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.683
<v Speaker 1>exercise and changing who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really did have a big impact on </v>

639
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:48.550
<v Speaker 1>who we are today was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I kind of sort of revealed itself.</v>

640
00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.383
<v Speaker 1>He really was based on a massive delinah</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberate coverup and I even tracked </v>

641
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 1>down if I've got Andrew Mecca who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>his right hand man,</v>

642
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:57.340
<v Speaker 1>who cheerfully admitted to me when </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed him.</v>

643
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we covered it up.</v>

644
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we covered it up.</v>

645
00:27:59.551 --> 00:27:59.941
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:00.311
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

647
00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>we deliberately went out on a mission to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of spin our way out of this problem</v>

648
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.703
<v Speaker 1>that the scientists were saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no causative link between self </v>

649
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:07.914
<v Speaker 1>esteem and all these virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing results with my dancing </v>

650
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.240
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your ideas crap.</v>

651
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I actually,</v>

652
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I actually found a tape recording of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting at which the lead scientist,</v>

653
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's a sociologist called Dr Neil</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelser.</v>

654
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I actually found an audio recording of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meeting in which he announced to the</v>

655
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:30.084
<v Speaker 1>group what the results were and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying is we're not getting </v>

656
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:36.590
<v Speaker 1>what you want us to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 1>where we are seeing a link between self </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem and good outcomes.</v>

658
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.780
<v Speaker 1>We're not sure if it's causative or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he's saying is,</v>

659
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in education,</v>

660
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.084
<v Speaker 1>you can see that people who have high </v>
<v Speaker 1>good exam results have better self </v>

661
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:48.684
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Vasco thought was that the self </v>

662
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:52.200
<v Speaker 1>esteem was causing the good exam </v>
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>

663
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but actually what's causing the service </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

664
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

665
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

666
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:00.630
<v Speaker 1>and then I found another tape from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of months later we were people,</v>

667
00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 1>including this guy I interviewed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting blowjobs all day.</v>

668
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Good self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I founded say with this meeting,</v>

669
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I just want to suck letter steam right </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their belly pipe.</v>

670
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stuff that I've always found amazing,</v>

671
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this kind of rebellion that happened </v>

672
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:19.524
<v Speaker 1>at this meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the guy that I tracked down </v>

673
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:21.294
<v Speaker 1>where they stood up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really uncomfortable with what </v>

674
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:23.934
<v Speaker 1>you're saying to the media because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that we found this link and we </v>

675
00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 1>haven't got this link.</v>

676
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.380
<v Speaker 1>So come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

677
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.733
<v Speaker 1>It was just sort of get stuff done like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I would have fought self </v>

678
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:38.094
<v Speaker 1>esteem is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's healthy self esteem is a </v>

679
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:41.394
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a guy called Professor Roy </v>

680
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.773
<v Speaker 1>Baumeister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I also tracked down who was the </v>

681
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 1>guide that kind of busted this if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't much to track it down.</v>

682
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I just found his email and emailed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said there is such a thing as off</v>

683
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:54.600
<v Speaker 1>the bat side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at pebbles tweaks,</v>

684
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>bloke to get like an aboriginal tracker </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find him.</v>

685
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.770
<v Speaker 1>But now he of course he said there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a thing as healthy 70,</v>

686
00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 1>but if it is earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

687
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:03.214
<v Speaker 1>Einstein had really good self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 1>will probably we guess Bhava dressing </v>

688
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he say that to staff?</v>

689
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>That pair of trousers twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banks out there.</v>

690
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm to do some maths and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein.</v>

691
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.843
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also is an interesting guy </v>

692
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:18.814
<v Speaker 1>because his father was a literal Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father fought with a narcissist and </v>

693
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Second World War and as Roy Baumeister </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

694
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.913
<v Speaker 1>Hitler had high self esteem too and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would appear certainly believed in many </v>

695
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:30.460
<v Speaker 1>of these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

696
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.730
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mystery.</v>

697
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He's a mystery because I think he might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a bit down on himself at times</v>

698
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:38.850
<v Speaker 1>when he was on his own and felt terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

699
00:30:38.851 --> 00:30:40.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self esteem.</v>

700
00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:41.664
<v Speaker 1>If that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says that all kinds of bad antisocial </v>

701
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 1>behaviors are because it's deep down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't love yourself about you.</v>

702
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Then what got you off on this mission?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

703
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.313
<v Speaker 1>because that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the kind of the story of my </v>

704
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.130
<v Speaker 1>early life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was an idiot growing up.</v>

705
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I failed all my exams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't concentrate at school,</v>

706
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble with the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was alcoholic,</v>

707
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.943
<v Speaker 1>drug abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole staff and through my </v>

708
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.543
<v Speaker 1>twenties I was in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flop my twitter is trying to sort my </v>

709
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:06.004
<v Speaker 1>head out and the constant refrain from </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers at school from the counselors </v>

710
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:10.714
<v Speaker 1>was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got low self esteem and your </v>

711
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 1>parents didn't love you.</v>

712
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd very victorian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 1>classic English parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

714
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.563
<v Speaker 1>they never liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved you enough and that's why you're </v>

715
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 1>so unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I completely bought this.</v>

716
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:21.004
<v Speaker 1>I completely believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I bought this idea that my problem </v>

717
00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:24.394
<v Speaker 1>deep down was that I didn't love myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had low self esteem and that what I </v>

718
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 1>had to do to cure it was to get high </v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

719
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>So I did all these things to get high </v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

720
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And then I spoke to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy baumeister found out that it was all</v>

721
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 1>a myth and it was only like six years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and it was like,</v>

722
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.803
<v Speaker 1>oh hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that everything I </v>

723
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:39.364
<v Speaker 1>thought was true about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole journey I've been on of self </v>

724
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:42.724
<v Speaker 1>improvement has been based on bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was based on the language may be </v>

725
00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bogus,</v>

726
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:51.394
<v Speaker 1>but what ultimately aren't we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for some sort of form of what I </v>

727
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 1>want to say connection.</v>

728
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you want to go round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rambled puffed up on a theme or mad like</v>

729
00:31:58.811 --> 00:32:01.420
<v Speaker 1>a bull frog snack or high as a kite on </v>
<v Speaker 1>silliness,</v>

730
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to feel terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of worthlessness.</v>

731
00:32:04.061 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And one could imagine that a childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have physical affection and,</v>

732
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.513
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>validation in it might lead someone to </v>

733
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 1>not feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

734
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a,</v>

735
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.920
<v Speaker 1>there is an element of truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

736
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.763
<v Speaker 1>so where the book ends up is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is with this idea of what is the self </v>

737
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.073
<v Speaker 1>and there is a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's sense of self and that's a </v>

738
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:22.834
<v Speaker 1>lot of that story is genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of who we are used is down to </v>

739
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 1>just an accident of genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I,</v>

740
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.323
<v Speaker 1>when I do my personality test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I am is I'm high in the trait of </v>

741
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:32.464
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

742
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism goes hand in hand with low </v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem.</v>

743
00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you suffer from low self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're generally a high neurotic.</v>

744
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 1>But because it's a relatively stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality trait,</v>

745
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 1>it means that you can't actually do much</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

746
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.400
<v Speaker 1>But you're right to say I was born with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a neurotic brain.</v>

747
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.443
<v Speaker 1>If I'd have had more loving parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been brought up happier </v>

748
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this combination of a neurotic brain</v>

749
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 1>and on parents that weren't very </v>
<v Speaker 1>affectionate isn't a nasty combination.</v>

750
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.480
<v Speaker 1>So they did have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

751
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is you can't do anything about</v>

752
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it once you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a pretty neurotic brain.</v>

753
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And Mum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mum,</v>

754
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.270
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't have given me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>smothering theater.</v>

755
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Our mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she loved the hell out of there.</v>

756
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:10.754
<v Speaker 1>Oh Russ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're very confident there's the </v>

757
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.763
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can live a terrible drug addict </v>

758
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.833
<v Speaker 1>and an alcoholic and written with self </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt and all that kind of stuff and </v>

759
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.063
<v Speaker 1>sort of fast moving mind that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever looking for something that </v>

760
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.930
<v Speaker 1>probably isn't even there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think like that?</v>

761
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.773
<v Speaker 1>The isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ideas I'm interested in </v>

762
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll is that wherever,</v>

763
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it's a biomechanical model that</v>

764
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>we prefer over some kind of Mumbo jumbo </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual model.</v>

765
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Liberty essential self is interconnected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all sorts of important to me is</v>

766
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:47.681
<v Speaker 1>the possibility and potentiality for </v>
<v Speaker 1>change both on an individual level,</v>

767
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 1>in a social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural level.</v>

768
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.853
<v Speaker 1>I believe in change very much because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a drug addict and now one day at a </v>

769
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no drugs,</v>

770
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 1>different behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>

771
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It depends what you mean by change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course if we can heal,</v>

772
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course we can heal.</v>

773
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:04.394
<v Speaker 1>So I'm much happier now as a 40 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I wants us a 22 year olds fucking </v>

774
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 22 year olds.</v>

775
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.170
<v Speaker 1>But I'm much happier now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.180
<v Speaker 1>because I have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

777
00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.053
<v Speaker 1>a wife that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps me when I'm going a bit mad </v>

778
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and things like this.</v>

779
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.393
<v Speaker 1>So of course we can heal and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously been on a big journey of </v>

780
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 1>healing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't do it is.</v>

781
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.870
<v Speaker 1>So the whole human potential idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have very much with us today is</v>

782
00:34:23.871 --> 00:34:24.704
<v Speaker 1>this toxic lie which tells our young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you can do anything you want to </v>

783
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.174
<v Speaker 1>do and be anything you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to dream big and kind of </v>

784
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very inspirational.</v>

785
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.933
<v Speaker 1>But it's also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous because what it does is </v>

786
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 1>it tells people that when they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which most of us do,</v>

787
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 1>it's their fault and that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and thing.</v>

788
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.763
<v Speaker 1>We forget that the reasons that we fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>our many and myriad and lots of the </v>

789
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:49.070
<v Speaker 1>marina and brought in our environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we blame ourselves.</v>

790
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:49.904
<v Speaker 1>So the book actually begins with talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about suicide and the regions that we </v>

791
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 1>kill ourselves.</v>

792
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.163
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of the model of pathway into </v>

793
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.253
<v Speaker 1>suicide is one that says that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said overly high expectations for </v>

794
00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and when we fail again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and again and again,</v>

795
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 1>and we feel stuck in that failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the cell starts to become in</v>

796
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>a really dangerous place to combat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular issue.</v>

797
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Then I think the big societal way is we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to stop telling this lie that you </v>

798
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:16.460
<v Speaker 1>can do anything you want to do and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you want to do.</v>

799
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:17.294
<v Speaker 1>We cannot transform my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot be beyonce or Michael Jordan </v>

800
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:22.720
<v Speaker 1>because we decide that that's what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

801
00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:23.554
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

802
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are animals.</v>

803
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:25.454
<v Speaker 1>We are biologically limited and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing we can do about that other than </v>

804
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyonce is beyonce.</v>

805
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

806
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.450
<v Speaker 1>they have a particular biology which </v>
<v Speaker 1>enables to that particular acculturation</v>

807
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 1>say in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on saying it,</v>

808
00:35:37.601 --> 00:35:38.290
<v Speaker 1>bulks and teller.</v>

809
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 1>She's crap for the first eight years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her life.</v>

810
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 1>She's not that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might make her better.</v>

811
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 1>She must be bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

812
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to do an even better </v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

813
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 1>but why is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

814
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 1>but like I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that this idea of um,</v>

815
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.213
<v Speaker 1>happiness through sort of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment in a very materialistic way </v>

816
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.203
<v Speaker 1>was always just a marketing idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you sort of think of the vivid </v>

817
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:05.301
<v Speaker 1>images of Coca Cola and apple and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of glorifications of the self,</v>

818
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>

819
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 1>if you can do what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

820
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.660
<v Speaker 1>like is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea,</v>

821
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:10.494
<v Speaker 1>I think he's merely suggested so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fulfill it with a can of coca </v>

822
00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:17.781
<v Speaker 1>cola or a new iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of change and potentiality,</v>

823
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that this I think is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to people.</v>

824
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.800
<v Speaker 1>But I suppose where it goes wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps is when it,</v>

825
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:25.703
<v Speaker 1>when there's a preordained idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is you're meant to be in order to be </v>

826
00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

827
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking from personal experience,</v>

828
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:31.224
<v Speaker 1>I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got loads of money and I'm famous </v>

829
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and have sex with every one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great.</v>

830
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.713
<v Speaker 1>So I tried those things and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits of it that were sensually </v>

831
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egotistically rewarding.</v>

832
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:46.260
<v Speaker 1>But I found them all to be ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ultimately unfulfilling.</v>

833
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And now my life is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.290
<v Speaker 1>admittedly we've economic comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm living in a degree,</v>

835
00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go out and do terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to get money,</v>

836
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but like at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

837
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

838
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.133
<v Speaker 1>but I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm living in a kind of an ordinary </v>

839
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:03.320
<v Speaker 1>domestic sort of life or partner have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trialed pets,</v>

840
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a headedness anymore.</v>

841
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:06.114
<v Speaker 1>I'm not living in a decadent life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think I was trying to live in </v>

842
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 1>accordance with a myth that was untrue.</v>

843
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.933
<v Speaker 1>So I completely agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my concern would be if we're left </v>

844
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:15.744
<v Speaker 1>with just a biomechanical model of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is your limitations as an animal and as </v>

845
00:37:19.051 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 1>an individual that people might settle </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a life that's fulfilling.</v>

846
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

847
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a nuance here.</v>

848
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:28.614
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across like I'm attacking </v>

849
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:31.524
<v Speaker 1>individualism completely isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a sort of big polemic because </v>

850
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:35.094
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of being a grown up is take a step </v>

851
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:39.940
<v Speaker 1>back and go actually individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot pretty amazing as well.</v>

852
00:37:39.941 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Like what we've achieved in the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half thousand years.</v>

853
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done some pretty amazing stuff and</v>

854
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:48.060
<v Speaker 1>some bad stuff like technology in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at New York,</v>

855
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 1>we built New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

856
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.373
<v Speaker 1>And a part of that is individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from that is that we tell people </v>

857
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should shoot for the stars,</v>

858
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but we also have a full idea of what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being is in our culture today.</v>

859
00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the left,</v>

860
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:02.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to believe that the human brain </v>

861
00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>is a blank slate and that we are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in a place of equal,</v>

862
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>amazing potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't true.</v>

863
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:10.854
<v Speaker 1>We all have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all biological limited in </v>

864
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we all have different talents,</v>

865
00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:16.100
<v Speaker 1>different abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a guy called Brian little,</v>

866
00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:16.934
<v Speaker 1>I speak to who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an expert in this kind of </v>

867
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 1>personality stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks a lot about the damage the Self</v>

868
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Esteem Myth has wrought upon our people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

869
00:38:24.181 --> 00:38:25.014
<v Speaker 1>and he says that we need to give people </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of equals and personal projects </v>

870
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.133
<v Speaker 1>over which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives them meaning but over which </v>

871
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 1>they have efficacy I ever wished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they,</v>

872
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:33.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in trying to be the </v>

873
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 1>fastest man in the world if you are 86 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have one leg,</v>

874
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:38.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

875
00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.780
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to understand that,</v>

876
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.013
<v Speaker 1>know that the capabilities of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and encourage them in those </v>

877
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 1>specific directions and not say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

878
00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>you can be beyonce.</v>

879
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Just dream big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

880
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.304
<v Speaker 1>These values and ideals are probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of erroneous and that sort of </v>

881
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 1>established by capitalist consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>template.</v>

882
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:58.441
<v Speaker 1>These other constellation is populated </v>
<v Speaker 1>body idols and icons of the capitalists.</v>

883
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Skyscape absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the economy.</v>

884
00:39:00.961 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning of our chat and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about who is this?</v>

885
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Who is this hero is surrounded by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>22 year old thin stomach,</v>

886
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.560
<v Speaker 1>big boobed globally minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Entrepreneurial.</v>

887
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a budget.</v>

888
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is this person with?</v>

889
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:19.040
<v Speaker 1>This person is the hero of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we live in a near liberal culture,</v>

890
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 1>neoliberal environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the hero of neoliberalism.</v>

891
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 1>This is the person who is most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

892
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out best to survive and thrive in </v>

893
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:27.754
<v Speaker 1>the neoliberal environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the person I culture is </v>

894
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:30.184
<v Speaker 1>trying to try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to attempt us into becoming a </v>

895
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.380
<v Speaker 1>facsimile low.</v>

896
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.510
<v Speaker 1>He's not a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

897
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:34.743
<v Speaker 1>he's a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it's sort of probably old </v>

898
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.074
<v Speaker 1>white blokes pottery masturbating over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image you just described because </v>

899
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that person doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cipher,</v>

900
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.503
<v Speaker 1>not a cultural myth is a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct and we're all tormented by it </v>

901
00:39:51.161 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 1>to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.013
<v Speaker 1>we all want to be this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course as we get older and </v>

903
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:55.920
<v Speaker 1>fatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

904
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.980
<v Speaker 1>we become less and less to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you know,</v>

905
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why,</v>

906
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most vulnerable groups for </v>

907
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:02.760
<v Speaker 1>suicide are middle aged men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know when,</v>

908
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 1>when you hit your forties and fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've come up against these limitations</v>

909
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:06.904
<v Speaker 1>very much and you begin to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to be that person that </v>

910
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.234
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been told that I ought to </v>

911
00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:11.631
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

912
00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your physical gestures,</v>

913
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you did that mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to the Nazi salute.</v>

914
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:16.723
<v Speaker 1>You as you gestured that the bloke was </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and a bath and they think it's </v>

915
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:20.974
<v Speaker 1>because really where we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for this kind of resolution is </v>

916
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.390
<v Speaker 1>inward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's peaceful in our connection.</v>

917
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the repeated reframes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm banging on about if that,</v>

918
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.653
<v Speaker 1>that all of these things that like many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the discoveries that are made by the </v>

919
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.970
<v Speaker 1>sort of world of neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I knew next to nothing about,</v>

920
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:40.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

921
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.783
<v Speaker 1>like it was sort of in sociology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and stuff I've already outlined </v>

922
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:47.134
<v Speaker 1>in spiritual principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as we discussed prior to us </v>

923
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:50.584
<v Speaker 1>recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that many of the </v>

924
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:53.314
<v Speaker 1>particularities and sociocultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of religious doctrine that are </v>

925
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>particular to the time of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>

926
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I can see that those observances ain't </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly helpful.</v>

927
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.103
<v Speaker 1>But the perennial ideas of oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of self is realized through </v>

928
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:11.554
<v Speaker 1>communion with the whole fruit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance that the material is </v>

929
00:41:15.011 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>transient and temporary lessons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned in my own life.</v>

930
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I recognize we're already bloody written</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in old,</v>

931
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 1>old 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

932
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.193
<v Speaker 1>The ancient texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when some Swami said to me in India </v>

933
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.103
<v Speaker 1>like chillingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the material world has nothing else to </v>

934
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:32.291
<v Speaker 1>give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

935
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take from</v>

936
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it made my stomach turn over when he</v>

937
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 2>said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew he was telling the truth.</v>

938
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I knew what he meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop looking for it in fame.</v>

939
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Stop looking for it in money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on a daily basis,</v>

940
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up and I think,</v>

941
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:47.811
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

942
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:49.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's why again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

943
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.773
<v Speaker 2>in classical myths there is per permit </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to go through the daily punishment </v>

944
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:55.874
<v Speaker 2>because he stole the file.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sufis who asked to continually push the </v>

945
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:04.001
<v Speaker 2>rock up the hill because it's an ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 2>realization because the self is an event</v>

946
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.383
<v Speaker 2>rather than an object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The self is the conscious awareness of </v>

947
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:08.954
<v Speaker 2>our own experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think can be brought into </v>

948
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.404
<v Speaker 2>alignment with a different kind of pace </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do reject that external matrix of </v>

949
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 2>ideas that were supposed to be heading </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>

950
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.293
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't abandon the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit because I think that's how we </v>

951
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 2>can change the world with that energy</v>

952
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.990
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

953
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

954
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one thing that individualism</v>

955
00:42:32.681 --> 00:42:35.770
<v Speaker 1>gets wrong is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it in over sin,</v>

956
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.953
<v Speaker 1>over emphasizing the individual is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns it back turns its back on on the </v>

957
00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 1>fact that we are a tribal animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

958
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.313
<v Speaker 1>we are a connected species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spent over 90 percent of our time on </v>

959
00:42:46.391 --> 00:42:47.224
<v Speaker 1>this earth as members of hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes of around 148 people for </v>

960
00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:51.664
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and years before </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of thousand years before </v>

961
00:42:53.861 --> 00:42:54.694
<v Speaker 1>civilization go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how long did that go on hunter </v>

962
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.060
<v Speaker 1>gathering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of thousands of years.</v>

963
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the average that you tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that specific date for the book,</v>

964
00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:04.144
<v Speaker 1>but they're all wildly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up kind of fudging a little </v>

965
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

966
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.163
<v Speaker 1>hang on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found a big tribal people cross that </v>

967
00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.670
<v Speaker 1>ice plateau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always argued about that,</v>

968
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:13.271
<v Speaker 1>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

969
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:13.900
<v Speaker 1>but we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.360
<v Speaker 1>we had these tribal brains and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

971
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.330
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

972
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:17.164
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we basically.</v>

973
00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.530
<v Speaker 1>This is a blip the way you said that 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year democratic blip in ancient Greece.</v>

974
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.041
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

975
00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:21.874
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked him,</v>

976
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.760
<v Speaker 1>but then I must band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he goes to site.</v>

977
00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just a clearing in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about civilization,</v>

978
00:43:26.191 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Speaker 1>like it's some big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

979
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.190
<v Speaker 1>just for while the forest is cleared </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

980
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.053
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got televisions and towers and </v>

981
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.790
<v Speaker 1>then nature will reclaim it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for hundreds of thousands of years we</v>

982
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:40.480
<v Speaker 1>were quite happy with the berries in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huntington and the Shaman and now.</v>

983
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I,</v>

984
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

985
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:42.910
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

986
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.743
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we kind of turn our back very much </v>

987
00:43:44.891 --> 00:43:45.310
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

988
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:46.143
<v Speaker 1>on the kind of individual on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential connect connected part of our </v>

989
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 1>humanity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

990
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.790
<v Speaker 1>well it's not in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I was living in Australia.</v>

991
00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I did a story on him place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rookwood cemetery outside Sydney,</v>

992
00:43:57.851 --> 00:43:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and it's the biggest cemetery in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern hemisphere,</v>

993
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.840
<v Speaker 1>so city of dead people and it's all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all a kind of cordoned off in terms</v>

994
00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:07.320
<v Speaker 1>of the culture.</v>

995
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a Chinese cemetery in Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cemetery in all that stuff.</v>

996
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit of a downer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't mix with the wrong group.</v>

997
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's very tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You barely meet with them lot,</v>

998
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:17.973
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just be some mush as she is a </v>

999
00:44:20.081 --> 00:44:20.914
<v Speaker 1>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

1000
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to our tribal cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are tribal,</v>

1001
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even even in death,</v>

1002
00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:24.904
<v Speaker 1>we can't skip the tribe business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I asked the guy who kind of manages </v>

1003
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:27.993
<v Speaker 1>imagery as a WHO's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the worst people for kind of </v>

1004
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 1>tending the grays coming back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1005
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Christians by far and away all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

1006
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep coming back.</v>

1007
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1008
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1009
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they polish the grave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bring gifts and flowers.</v>

1010
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:39.774
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

1011
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.973
<v Speaker 1>some of the racist have like annual </v>
<v Speaker 1>events where they come and have little </v>

1012
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:44.530
<v Speaker 1>parties for the greatest westerns.</v>

1013
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:45.383
<v Speaker 1>They come once or twice and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just discovered shit and that's </v>

1014
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:48.380
<v Speaker 1>individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.253
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 1>even down to the kind of the unit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

1017
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they did all their debt,</v>

1018
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.533
<v Speaker 1>now they're irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We much more me focused and I didn't </v>

1019
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 1>understand that at the time I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we so bad?</v>

1020
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.783
<v Speaker 1>But now I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we're individualists </v>

1021
00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:01.651
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1022
00:45:01.651 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have,</v>

1023
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 1>we don't connect to the path with NCSL </v>
<v Speaker 1>linear tradition.</v>

1024
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family were not,</v>

1026
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 1>were far less family minded than those </v>
<v Speaker 1>other eastern cultures.</v>

1027
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And that Tuesday I miss you grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1028
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Where did they go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1029
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a folder.</v>

1030
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that when you were talking about </v>

1031
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Confucius and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1032
00:45:24.291 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 1>and like having a different relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with self and selfies.</v>

1033
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.363
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything in that stuff that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be useful to us in a collective </v>

1034
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 1>ideologies that we could somehow ransack</v>
<v Speaker 1>propagate?</v>

1035
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised you from my research was that,</v>

1036
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on if we always talk about </v>

1037
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.550
<v Speaker 1>this kind of crazy myths they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was once a better time and it</v>

1038
00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:47.384
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was once a perfect English and </v>

1039
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.193
<v Speaker 1>make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But actually there was a better time in </v>

1040
00:45:51.211 --> 00:45:52.450
<v Speaker 1>a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying she,</v>

1041
00:45:52.451 --> 00:45:53.284
<v Speaker 1>you back to that time because we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because it's kind of changed </v>

1042
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 1>because of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1043
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the time,</v>

1044
00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.753
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised to see that the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle 20th century was a time of </v>

1045
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:04.860
<v Speaker 1>much more quality of the code that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists call the.</v>

1046
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:05.694
<v Speaker 1>It appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called it the great compression </v>

1047
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.580
<v Speaker 1>causes compression between the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1048
00:46:09.581 --> 00:46:10.414
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1049
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.833
<v Speaker 1>of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was much less inequality and that </v>

1050
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 1>was this era of regulation of high </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxation,</v>

1051
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 1>of unionization.</v>

1052
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 1>But it was also before globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a kind of a simpler time.</v>

1053
00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1054
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of knocked I think our,</v>

1055
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.793
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kind of individually selves into </v>

1056
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:31.380
<v Speaker 1>that era of more collectivization was </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

1057
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:32.214
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the great depression and it was </v>

1058
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:34.734
<v Speaker 1>the first and second world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in those periods of massive crisis </v>

1059
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.370
<v Speaker 1>knocked us into going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1060
00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 1>We need to start looking after each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1061
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:43.710
<v Speaker 1>We can't have a world of war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic disaster and all that stuff.</v>

1062
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:44.331
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1063
00:46:44.331 --> 00:46:45.164
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that worries me is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a bit of a disaster to kind of </v>

1064
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:50.620
<v Speaker 1>knock us into a collective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1065
00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:51.454
<v Speaker 1>I'm inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll tell you that what happens is we </v>

1066
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:55.400
<v Speaker 1>get shocked and terrified by sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1067
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 1>shock doctrine and she's called it low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get all terrified.</v>

1068
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And then you act on the basis of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual interests.</v>

1069
00:47:01.961 --> 00:47:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it became clear and out.</v>

1070
00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Adam Kay says that the myth of a time is</v>
<v Speaker 1>often contrary to its truth.</v>

1071
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So if we're told we're individuals or </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals or individuals,</v>

1072
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the reality is you are a blob of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

1073
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.393
<v Speaker 1>That's what said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1074
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.251
<v Speaker 1>we're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1075
00:47:18.251 --> 00:47:19.084
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about our bloody air cuts and </v>

1076
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.980
<v Speaker 1>selfies and our converse trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got these ones that are made out of</v>

1077
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 1>nikes now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nikes,</v>

1078
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.810
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh going to die.</v>

1079
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.233
<v Speaker 1>Dying.</v>

1080
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So I've got bit that worries me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very bad.</v>

1081
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Imperfect I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1082
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about them sometimes,</v>

1083
00:47:37.791 --> 00:47:38.624
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually basically I've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>got two little worries on the end of my </v>

1084
00:47:40.581 --> 00:47:41.414
<v Speaker 2>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just thinking some get some </v>

1085
00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:47.711
<v Speaker 2>bubble gum on that burger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if the beech root folds on the Isa?</v>

1086
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So we're thinking of ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>

1087
00:47:50.541 --> 00:47:51.374
<v Speaker 2>but really we're just being marketed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're fulfilling our NATO because </v>

1088
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.420
<v Speaker 2>most people aren't going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyonce,</v>

1089
00:47:56.421 --> 00:47:58.040
<v Speaker 2>but heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not heroes.</v>

1090
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Icons of often functioned in that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1091
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hold that aspirational object up and</v>

1092
00:48:03.171 --> 00:48:04.004
<v Speaker 2>instead of being to express the essence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of beyonce is a woman who can express </v>

1093
00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 2>her womanhood through creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>potency,</v>

1094
00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:11.624
<v Speaker 2>Feminine Goddess Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll settle for or I'll buy the </v>

1095
00:48:14.151 --> 00:48:14.984
<v Speaker 2>same headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1096
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:16.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1097
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1098
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1099
00:48:17.971 --> 00:48:18.481
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:19.291
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1101
00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:22.590
<v Speaker 1>it's all that's used for marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes and I think the other thing,</v>

1102
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when all this is before any of this sort</v>

1103
00:48:27.061 --> 00:48:31.230
<v Speaker 1>of engine green stuff is all that tribal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and the fact that the,</v>

1104
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.870
<v Speaker 1>that we are a particular kind of tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1105
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:34.611
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1106
00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.444
<v Speaker 1>we liked the chimps in that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only groupish that we attack other </v>

1107
00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:40.710
<v Speaker 1>groups and you see that a lot on social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

1108
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So in human tribe as in the chimp drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the status is always changing.</v>

1109
00:48:46.441 --> 00:48:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Who's at the top is always in kind of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>flux.</v>

1110
00:48:48.421 --> 00:48:49.254
<v Speaker 1>It cook a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a troop leader will be up there for 45 </v>

1111
00:48:50.701 --> 00:48:51.560
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1112
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.960
<v Speaker 1>we are preoccupied with status and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that kind of</v>

1113
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.083
<v Speaker 2>that was going on in the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stray into anthropology a little bit </v>

1114
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:00.964
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I talking because we are trying </v>

1115
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 2>to understand it in a central truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't.</v>

1116
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 2>With that goes beyond the limited and </v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting context of civilization,</v>

1117
00:49:06.941 --> 00:49:07.774
<v Speaker 2>which is only a blip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but saying the hunter gatherer tribes </v>

1118
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.953
<v Speaker 2>would have been luckily little chimp </v>
<v Speaker 2>society with your only chief for a </v>

1119
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.090
<v Speaker 2>minute and then someone's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock that off with a rock.</v>

1120
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.620
<v Speaker 1>We're in chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's four to five years,</v>

1121
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting because we see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in electrocytes inhumans.</v>

1122
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same.</v>

1123
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I had the banana but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1124
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's going to have social media,</v>

1125
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.871
<v Speaker 1>isn't it with you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1126
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly worried about how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes we've got you.</v>

1127
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll relative status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>status updates and all this stuff.</v>

1128
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.133
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is that is that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are aggressively tribal like </v>

1129
00:49:37.321 --> 00:49:38.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1130
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our relatives,</v>

1131
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the chimpanzees that we kind of attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other groups.</v>

1132
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:42.064
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's another really sort of </v>

1133
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:43.174
<v Speaker 1>dangerous aspect of social media is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourages these very ancient kind of </v>

1134
00:49:46.101 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>tribal circuitry in us that when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks the codes of our Ingroup,</v>

1135
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.243
<v Speaker 1>we sort of go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go off and kind of tear their </v>

1136
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 1>limbs off in a sense them attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is really ancient stuff.</v>

1137
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>This is really powerful tribal circuitry</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1138
00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.270
<v Speaker 1>in the human self that thinks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kind of twitter storms.</v>

1140
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of feeding off.</v>

1141
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1142
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.630
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you when you were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scottish modern history.</v>

1143
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Tell us what happened to you when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>met a nice den.</v>

1144
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Would the villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually he was the tribal guy.</v>

1145
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So this is a really interesting guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>called John Pridmore who,</v>

1146
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1147
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.190
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1148
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.440
<v Speaker 1>he's just a classic eastern gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love Him.</v>

1149
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:23.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really interesting guy and he </v>

1150
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:28.244
<v Speaker 1>looks exactly like you spent lucky's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about seven foot with big leather coat </v>

1151
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:31.664
<v Speaker 1>on and bolt head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you sat there like with his fist </v>

1152
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:38.520
<v Speaker 1>down fist or with a big watch down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1153
00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.560
<v Speaker 1>if you want him to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'd call that a kettle kettle.</v>

1154
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh crikey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But have a me baby.</v>

1155
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.883
<v Speaker 1>But he was living his life in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic Wimpish tribridge way when he </v>

1156
00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 1>was a gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1157
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:51.330
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an enforcer for a drug for the,</v>

1158
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>for the drug gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the firm,</v>

1159
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the firms and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone didn't pay their money.</v>

1160
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd kick a rat in the shins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Well he met with him.</v>

1162
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Was it torture and beat people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1163
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:04.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1164
00:51:04.331 --> 00:51:09.331
<v Speaker 1>so some things will be naughty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a gentle words to describe stuff.</v>

1165
00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never shoot us because if you,</v>

1167
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 1>if you had to shoot it and then you went</v>
<v Speaker 1>into prison for longer.</v>

1168
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 1>So he had a machete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.560
<v Speaker 1>He had a special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His shirt.</v>

1170
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 1>He had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a special,</v>

1171
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>especially a bespoke leather coat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a pocket for a Jif lemon bottle with</v>

1172
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 1>acid in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of acid in it.</v>

1173
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.933
<v Speaker 1>Bleach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have been to put in your eyes </v>

1174
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.360
<v Speaker 1>and a machete and the other one we </v>
<v Speaker 1>having pancakes,</v>

1175
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but then he had a massive nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown.</v>

1176
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It became Catholic faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found the Lord today.</v>

1177
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was he important in your research?</v>

1178
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Because he was my example of the tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

1179
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:46.184
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1180
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.001
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:47.550
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1182
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.290
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1183
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 1>he's gang was the tribe and they will go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to war with the opposing tribe,</v>

1184
00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:54.953
<v Speaker 1>which was obviously the rifle drugs took</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were also trying to sell drugs in </v>

1185
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 1>these kind of west end clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the,</v>

1186
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.433
<v Speaker 1>his nervous breakdown was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as well because it tells us a </v>

1187
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:03.853
<v Speaker 1>really important thing about the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the idea of the self as a </v>

1188
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:07.364
<v Speaker 1>storyteller.</v>

1189
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.413
<v Speaker 1>So there's this really interesting idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>from neuroscience about called </v>

1190
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:14.930
<v Speaker 1>confabulation and it's this idea that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all have this voice in our heads,</v>

1191
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:18.210
<v Speaker 1>this kind of internal model of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly writing all our events.</v>

1192
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:18.721
<v Speaker 1>Tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1193
00:52:18.721 --> 00:52:19.554
<v Speaker 1>you know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's saying this is why you did what </v>

1194
00:52:20.691 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you said,</v>

1195
00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 1>that this is why you're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you should do next.</v>

1196
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 1>But it has no access to the rest of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

1197
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's essentially making it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just telling you this story.</v>

1198
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.133
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have no access to the real </v>

1199
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:33.590
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you're doing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1200
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.633
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite terrifying concept because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's saying that we have no real idea </v>

1201
00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:39.430
<v Speaker 1>why we do what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we feel,</v>

1202
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 1>what we feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we feel,</v>

1203
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.373
<v Speaker 1>but the only reason that we feel that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like we do is because his voice is </v>

1204
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 1>telling us and it's just making stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1205
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So when he had his nervous breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was he,</v>

1206
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:49.950
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1207
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>he punched this guy and he thought he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed him and his boss,</v>

1208
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but when you put over a couple of nights</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1209
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're going to get in</v>

1210
00:52:56.331 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went back to his flat,</v>

1211
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 1>he started smoking a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put on some porn,</v>

1212
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and then the television started talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him and saying listing all the things</v>

1213
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:04.904
<v Speaker 1>he'd done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now John was brought up in a Catholic </v>

1214
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:09.840
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so his confabulation immediately,</v>

1215
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>his explanation of music was where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice is obviously the devil.</v>

1216
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>And that means that he's telling me I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go to hell.</v>

1217
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And that means that if I'm going to save</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself from hell,</v>

1218
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I need to pray to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he runs outside,</v>

1219
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 1>falls to his knees naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Naked,</v>

1220
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:24.330
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1221
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.303
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps with boner he was watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn and then and then and then he runs </v>

1222
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.570
<v Speaker 1>and he runs to his mom's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knocked on his mom's door,</v>

1223
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.200
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the erection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish this off,</v>

1224
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and his mom opens the door and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing job,</v>

1225
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.360
<v Speaker 1>what you do in John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1226
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:40.830
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

1227
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 1>something's amazing seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

1228
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 1>what's that full week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just soak up.</v>

1229
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:49.621
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

1230
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I've found God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1231
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:52.200
<v Speaker 1>at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

1232
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that.</v>

1233
00:53:55.001 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 1>But his confabulation was and saved him </v>
<v Speaker 1>from madness was the.</v>

1234
00:53:58.951 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Actually you've not had a nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown.</v>

1235
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:01.104
<v Speaker 1>You're having a psychotic incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I believe happened to him </v>

1236
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:03.624
<v Speaker 1>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1237
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1239
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.453
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took a story from his culture which </v>

1240
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:07.434
<v Speaker 1>was a Catholic Christian story of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is and what our place in that </v>

1241
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 1>reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it kept us out.</v>

1242
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:13.463
<v Speaker 1>Just the secular narrative for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in the consciousness sounded </v>

1243
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.430
<v Speaker 1>deck chairs on titanic time and it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of saying that's it.</v>

1244
00:54:18.431 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epiphany,</v>

1245
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the sudden revelation of essence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown.</v>

1246
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I reckon in a little while ago I had one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things,</v>

1247
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.773
<v Speaker 1>but because my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I like to think that my inner </v>

1248
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 1>critic now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Voice of confabulation,</v>

1249
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:31.854
<v Speaker 1>I think I've given mine access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep deep codes that you're one like </v>

1250
00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 1>that when you went through in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and nodal those recording.</v>

1251
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So my inner voice now I think I trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>that little guy also.</v>

1252
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't entirely trust it.</v>

1253
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I always use other people's information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and data.</v>

1254
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of doing this thing,</v>

1255
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1256
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

1257
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I've got older men further down the path</v>
<v Speaker 1>than me that it was sort of tell me no,</v>

1258
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:55.960
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell was was a mental breakdown mate,</v>

1259
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but like my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very conventional.</v>

1260
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I've understood that you sort of reboot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you question your identity and go,</v>

1261
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:03.570
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell have I been doing?</v>

1262
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you just said about the suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff and like.</v>

1263
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think with your man there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like,</v>

1264
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:08.681
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:55:08.681 --> 00:55:09.514
<v Speaker 1>The interpretive tool was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the vocabulary of Christianity </v>

1266
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 1>and we have the vocabulary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>

1267
00:55:15.571 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 1>but essentially there was one central </v>
<v Speaker 1>event and that central event was,</v>

1268
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to break out of the preexisting </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and anyway,</v>

1269
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter does it if you term it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as epiphany or breakdown as long as what</v>

1270
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:27.084
<v Speaker 1>happened subsequently as you stop being </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eastern gangster guy around for Jif </v>

1271
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:31.980
<v Speaker 1>lemon of acid and the machete and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a monk,</v>

1272
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a cool thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's an excellent point because.</v>

1273
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1274
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:36.663
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great that he didn't end up </v>

1275
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:38.363
<v Speaker 1>medicated in a psychiatric institute as </v>
<v Speaker 1>his Mother did at one point in his life </v>

1276
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's also great that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.840
<v Speaker 1>goes around preaching the Gospel to </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger children.</v>

1278
00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I love a cockney because I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>just that bad cockney priest.</v>

1279
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I would love a cockney priest and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is got a cottony monkey.</v>

1280
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It was really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1281
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.333
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's around.</v>

1282
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.193
<v Speaker 1>He's around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very odd moment when I was </v>

1283
00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 1>bothering him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my mom and it was very,</v>

1284
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 1>very Catholic and she said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is what you've been doing?</v>

1285
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1286
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been.</v>

1287
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:04.483
<v Speaker 1>I actually interviewed a Catholic monk </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to say something in the </v>

1288
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>market entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1289
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:07.811
<v Speaker 1>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1290
00:56:07.811 --> 00:56:08.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that?</v>

1291
00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:08.581
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1292
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:10.980
<v Speaker 1>he's just a guy called John pridmore </v>
<v Speaker 1>this gangster,</v>

1293
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and she went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

1294
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:12.924
<v Speaker 1>I've sat next to him at mass and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same place where I don't know </v>

1295
00:56:15.691 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 1>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it immediately sort of carry on</v>

1296
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 1>your research a bit more with your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1297
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit deflating.</v>

1298
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I was jumping jump in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be deflated by that.</v>

1299
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody when it sounds sort of movement</v>

1300
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit around,</v>

1301
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 1>rooting around in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archive your own mother says,</v>

1302
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:30.424
<v Speaker 1>I've met someone that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing and switch off show that </v>

1303
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.300
<v Speaker 1>they have attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say,</v>

1304
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have done a lot of that.</v>

1305
00:56:39.871 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Gang started like the sound of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1306
00:56:41.081 --> 00:56:41.711
<v Speaker 1>A great dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1307
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:43.770
<v Speaker 1>what about that thing that I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the interview that I</v>

1308
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.613
<v Speaker 1>was playing a computer game and the bits</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's a pirate and it's very like </v>

1309
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.590
<v Speaker 1>when I'm assassin's creed and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the elaborate missions where I'm robbing</v>

1310
00:56:50.591 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Spanish galleons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

1311
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 1>but then when it goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subplot where it reveals that you're not</v>

1312
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:55.774
<v Speaker 1>really Hispanic or you're not a pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a man in an office pretending to </v>

1313
00:56:58.541 --> 00:56:59.374
<v Speaker 1>be a pirate and the Games you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in the office of crap like Pac man </v>

1314
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:03.244
<v Speaker 1>looking games.</v>

1315
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.173
<v Speaker 1>I get bored with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really you're probably on a motor </v>

1316
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:07.144
<v Speaker 1>neuron level doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twiddling your thumbs about moving in </v>

1317
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 1>different directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're being the pirate,</v>

1318
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.304
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're smashing over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of a barrel when you're doing cool </v>

1319
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>stuff and when you're in the office it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>

1320
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:21.210
<v Speaker 1>So are we essentially just one as a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an experiencing entity?</v>

1321
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving data that you said it was like</v>

1322
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 1>electronical impulses and organizing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into all different stories.</v>

1323
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Looking for stories that are attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us,</v>

1324
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.044
<v Speaker 1>either because of some personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflection or because of the culture of </v>

1325
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 1>our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Validates and enjoys that story.</v>

1326
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:36.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

1327
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 1>So my last book was got the heritage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about exactly.</v>

1328
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:42.310
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how we experience our lives.</v>

1329
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>The story about the brain conjures this </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1330
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:46.140
<v Speaker 1>One neuroscientist I spoke to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

1331
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Chris described us.</v>

1332
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.080
<v Speaker 1>The illusion the brain makes makes us </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1333
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.210
<v Speaker 1>the invisible actor at the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and what it does to keep us,</v>

1334
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 1>keep us motivated to keep her as happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of forward kind of moving is it</v>

1335
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:59.730
<v Speaker 1>creates this narrative of meaning I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could call the brand the hero,</v>

1336
00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.260
<v Speaker 1>my crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1337
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.093
<v Speaker 1>it makes us this kind of hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates this very simplistic story </v>

1338
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.180
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to sort of sort of living live in</v>

1339
00:58:07.181 --> 00:58:09.870
<v Speaker 1>the middle of and the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you describe.</v>

1340
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.713
<v Speaker 1>It's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite fascinating actually because </v>

1341
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 1>as you describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're the pirate,</v>

1342
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.523
<v Speaker 1>the swashbuckling pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is full of meaning and your </v>

1343
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.630
<v Speaker 1>this heroic morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1344
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:20.210
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a part.</v>

1345
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a pirate,</v>

1346
00:58:21.401 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but what he's doing the little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous because there's quite a lot of</v>

1347
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:27.510
<v Speaker 1>murder and bloodshed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sense that he's theory a bit,</v>

1348
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:28.383
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on a journey of discovery because </v>

1349
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:30.964
<v Speaker 1>there's some sub characters that go when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to give up this piracy and </v>

1350
00:58:33.851 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>help us with our big.</v>

1351
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So the subtext here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1352
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:36.800
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1353
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this very,</v>

1354
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1355
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.940
<v Speaker 1>very ancient Greek story of of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an individual kind of going out into</v>

1356
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:42.783
<v Speaker 1>the world and causing great effects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then suddenly switched back into this </v>

1357
00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 1>office thing and you're just playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this boring guy moving counters.</v>

1358
00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.500
<v Speaker 1>It's too close to the actual reality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1359
00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Sat up at night playing on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>playstation.</v>

1360
00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.700
<v Speaker 1>You've covered generally just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>smacking your honor.</v>

1361
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It's quite Meta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite metta.</v>

1362
00:58:58.980 --> 00:58:59.813
<v Speaker 1>They sang that the reality of the pirate</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not your ultimate reality and it may </v>

1363
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is again,</v>

1364
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a religious idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say this thing that you're</v>

1365
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 1>one's ego matrix makes you the hero of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life.</v>

1366
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:11.674
<v Speaker 1>These scriptures that I'm forever </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging on about never bother bloody </v>

1367
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

1368
00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but there is no such thing as self.</v>

1369
00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:17.683
<v Speaker 1>You are not the hero of your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just experiencing this data and </v>

1370
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.553
<v Speaker 1>organizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a but really you all part of the </v>

1371
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:24.790
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one.</v>

1372
00:59:24.791 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the central tenet of all eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

1373
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Separation is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are experiencing this,</v>

1374
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are one.</v>

1375
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You are one with all phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:59:33.431 --> 00:59:34.264
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there will be one thing I think </v>

1377
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:38.880
<v Speaker 1>that goes back to these confucian ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>of if you know of collectivity and it,</v>

1378
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think the part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1379
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.313
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern kind of scientific kind of </v>

1380
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.150
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does bear out is,</v>

1381
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.620
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we are,</v>

1382
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.573
<v Speaker 1>that is this kind of illusion that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are living in this kind of the story </v>

1383
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 1>which we live our lives in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The middle of his is his,</v>

1384
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

1385
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.920
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1386
00:59:53.921 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 1>what do we have?</v>

1387
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:55.430
<v Speaker 1>What we really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>

1388
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:56.523
<v Speaker 1>All we know is the information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting our senses and our senses </v>

1389
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 1>experience that information is millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and millions of little electrical pulses</v>

1390
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and it uses those electrical policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like computer code to build reality that</v>

1391
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:07.244
<v Speaker 1>we experience is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the colors and shapes and patterns </v>

1392
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:10.304
<v Speaker 1>and sounds and it is a construction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a story and and it makes us feel </v>

1393
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>important or meaningful like the pirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in assassin's creed,</v>

1394
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.493
<v Speaker 1>but really strip all that away and we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we with the guy in the office </v>

1395
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>with the tiddlywinks in my tip link </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone will.</v>

1396
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.620

<v Speaker 1>What five books should pay.</v>

1397
01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we take for granted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people should read your book Selfie.</v>

1398
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>What five books do think I should go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate isn't?</v>

1399
01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do good in it.</v>

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>What the pertaining to these ideas now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1401
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:42.743
<v Speaker 1>See your clever right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clever man will tell us five bucks to </v>

1402
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>read and you've got basically your five </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite books.</v>

1403
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You reckon we should rave when we'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it?</v>

1410
01:00:59.001 --> 01:00:59.834
<v Speaker 1>essentially this is the geography of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought rigidness bit which talks about </v>

<v Speaker 1>Hi Jonathan.</v>

1420
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:19.694
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book I'm reading reading at the </v>

1421
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:21.974
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love the people of the rbs by </v>

1422
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.523
<v Speaker 1>Jack London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read the people at the rbs by </v>

1423
01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Jack London.</v>

1424
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Now people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>So he say so it's an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrote White Fang.</v>

1426
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1427
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:35.054
<v Speaker 1>So what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a nonfiction book and I think </v>

1428
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>it was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1429
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.493
<v Speaker 1>two where he went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw the east end of London has this </v>

1430
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>amazingly dangerous wild place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it was.</v>

1431
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.493
<v Speaker 1>And he dressed up as a poor person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into an adventure into who's </v>

1432
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>playing computer games in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1433
01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:49.874
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing book and it's really </v>

1434
01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 1>like some of those old books are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to read,</v>

1435
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's really almost three of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>golf football,</v>

1436
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:00.343
<v Speaker 1>potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes into a secondhand clothes shop </v>

1437
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>and get us all the garb and gets dressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and stuff and you know,</v>

1438
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.153
<v Speaker 1>you talked about getting into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that famous is it cooks the map </v>

1439
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:07.973
<v Speaker 1>shops still there in covent garden where</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the adventure is used to go and get </v>

1440
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:10.394
<v Speaker 1>their maps of darkest Africa and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to journey into the east end </v>

1441
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:14.151
<v Speaker 1>of London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

1442
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>well we can't help you with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dangerous.</v>

1443
01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really work of nonfiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't think sort of people kind</v>

1444
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:22.494
<v Speaker 1>of know the bitch about the people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the abyss and its description of what </v>

1445
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>these standards like in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just extraordinary.</v>

1446
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.673
<v Speaker 1>That edit and I'm sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I have a yard a please fucking </v>

1448
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:41.743

<v Speaker 1>I tried to spend together too many </v>

1449
01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>friends at the swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1450
01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Well what's the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done free done three.</v>

1451
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else can I talk about?</v>
