<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming on.</v>

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to understand your background </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>so could you tell us a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic work you do?</v>

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.433
<v Speaker 1>I guess that my background begins when </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an adolescent I was sent to the </v>

16
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>psychological system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was a regular truant.</v>

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>They have problems at school and when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of went and saw a psychologist,</v>

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>what I found was I just couldn't engage.</v>

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.043
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like they listened in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that progressed me and I kind of </v>

20
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>remember thinking at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't adults speak to young people?</v>

21
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:18.624
<v Speaker 1>In a way that respects the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are intelligent and know who they </v>

22
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>are to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I kind of thought and ruminated on it</v>

23
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>and even though I had problems at </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

24
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:27.534
<v Speaker 1>I decided that was the direction I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go in to actually be able to </v>

25
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.103
<v Speaker 1>transmit my own experiences into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of understanding of the young </v>

26
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what got me into therapy.</v>

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I did a psychology degree initially and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then moved into therapeutic context,</v>

28
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.364
<v Speaker 1>so studying more client centered didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily fit me because I'm quite a </v>

29
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.584
<v Speaker 1>challenging person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to use challenge in therapy what </v>

30
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.773
<v Speaker 1>it means and so your a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sort of conventionally inferior </v>

31
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.743
<v Speaker 1>p,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the therapist is what managers listen </v>

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and you stick your in there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the type.</v>

34
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.083
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've tended to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to feel that even though there are </v>

35
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.033
<v Speaker 1>therapists that are challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly client centered isn't so </v>

36
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.054
<v Speaker 1>egan and Roger's aren't necessarily egan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rogers or just to have the kind of </v>

37
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.613
<v Speaker 1>God so client centered therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think purism is an interesting </v>

38
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.244
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full stop because I kind of really </v>

39
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.644
<v Speaker 1>struggled with it and I was training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really lucky at Manchester </v>

40
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.393
<v Speaker 1>University that they kind of allowed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a freedom to express my own </v>

41
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:29.574
<v Speaker 1>beliefs in what I thought I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy to be and I kind of argued that </v>

42
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't ever be either of those types</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not that person.</v>

43
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>And even when you watch therapists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>action who claimed to be pure,</v>

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.033
<v Speaker 1>often you'll see they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing something kind of </v>

45
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.404
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I learned in the long run the best </v>

46
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>thing I could be in therapy with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just me,</v>

47
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.733
<v Speaker 1>so that I felt that my presence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and experience with the </v>

48
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>client's journey that really authentic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's effectively worked for</v>

49
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.380
<v Speaker 1>You think that part of the role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy is to discover a kind of truth,</v>

51
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.083
<v Speaker 1>a truth of the client's experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that so do you think it's necessary </v>

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.784
<v Speaker 1>for you to be authentic in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely believe that authenticity is </v>

53
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.494
<v Speaker 1>key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full Stop.</v>

54
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that we talk about authenticity </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if it's quite easy to achieve.</v>

55
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.434
<v Speaker 1>Just be yourself is a classic example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people say to you when </v>

56
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you're growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and when you're an adult,</v>

57
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>just be yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually being yourself takes a huge</v>

58
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>amount of courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge amount of self discovery,</v>

59
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.873
<v Speaker 1>a willingness to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a willingness to learn all the time and </v>

60
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.784
<v Speaker 1>it's quite scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that I try to be as </v>

61
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.534
<v Speaker 1>authentic as I can be all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure at times I get scared and that </v>

62
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.054
<v Speaker 1>makes me wear a mask or I'm convinced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody needs me to be or </v>

63
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.524
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll put one of those and I have to </v>

64
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.534
<v Speaker 1>work against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's human nature to some </v>

65
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.164
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

66
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Went at Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in there a couple of weeks ago.</v>

67
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>He's like an explorer survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

68
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a bit like bear grylls.</v>

69
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the grunge bear grylls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I see him.</v>

70
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.783
<v Speaker 1>It's like a shelf stripped back bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>grylls who said that when he spends </v>

71
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>prolonged periods of time on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

72
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.743
<v Speaker 1>what do you know that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aloneness itself is more challenging </v>

73
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.674
<v Speaker 1>than the survival aspects of what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing because he said that when you're </v>

74
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.323
<v Speaker 1>in relationship with another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly refining yourself and </v>

75
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he very interesting.</v>

76
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>They used these guys like even now as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at you and I'm seeing if you</v>

77
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>approve of one sign and was really sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of quite fascinating.</v>

78
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.083
<v Speaker 1>So when you're talking about when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about like having an experience </v>

79
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>of an authentic self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be a difficult thing for anybody</v>

80
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>to achieve because we responding to such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stimulation.</v>

81
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So sort of stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

82
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody seeks approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody to some degree wishes to be </v>

83
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.964
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time I think my journey </v>

84
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.743
<v Speaker 1>began when I started to feel like it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually me wanting to police the world </v>

85
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and get liked by everybody that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly making me exhausted.</v>

86
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't really reflecting on what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>

87
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.713
<v Speaker 1>And there was almost like a desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just accept that it isn't selfish to </v>

88
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's self full,</v>

89
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.393
<v Speaker 1>and to actually strip back what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought people wanted to know about me </v>

90
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:32.401
<v Speaker 1>and wanted me to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to just be myself and to some degree</v>

91
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>in my therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what works.</v>

92
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>That I don't feel that firstly I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be judged by my clients.</v>

93
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And conversely I don't judge my clients </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

94
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.193
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we experienced that thick </v>

95
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>conversation that kind of occurs as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thickness in therapy,</v>

96
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I know that people.</v>

97
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.723
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you mean by that thickness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think practitioners who may be </v>

98
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.354
<v Speaker 1>listening to this or get it and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>people the falling in love or having </v>

99
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really intense relationships.</v>

100
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.353
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's a northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>context to the relationship and other </v>

101
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>feeling in the room like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something bigger,</v>

102
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>wider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cerebral,</v>

103
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>but almost touchable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not that.</v>

104
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.223
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sense of knowing that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is where we're meant to be in that </v>

105
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.544
<v Speaker 1>moment and just feeling completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected and almost like within a </v>

106
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.434
<v Speaker 1>bubble of something good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it isn't with pain or </v>

107
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that it's good.</v>

108
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 2>You can use the role of the therapist </v>
<v Speaker 2>then to somehow recreate what sounds to </v>

109
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 2>me like you're describing there may say </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a kind of spiritual experience that </v>

110
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:40.560
<v Speaker 2>people perhaps to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 2>the example you used is like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in love with somebody.</v>

112
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.883
<v Speaker 2>I like that like in a non romantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>context that it that would pop pop </v>

113
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.513
<v Speaker 2>possibly a person with a mom or a rabbi </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a priest or a shaman where you feel </v>

114
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:54.854
<v Speaker 2>like I am being myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here I am present kind of dangerous </v>

115
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>place to go with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

116
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.093
<v Speaker 1>I think that throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you are and whatever culture </v>

117
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:06.660
<v Speaker 1>and society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll always be people who,</v>

118
00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:07.494
<v Speaker 1>as you talked about then have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions but essentially help to </v>

119
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:11.334
<v Speaker 1>navigate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that my job in my therapy is </v>

120
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.474
<v Speaker 1>navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I absolutely direct the </v>

121
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.474
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the truest waters ahead or if </v>

122
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>people keep making the same errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my job.</v>

123
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel to help them engage with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

124
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.444
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward and not end up in the same </v>

125
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:28.934
<v Speaker 1>position so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think it's my job to tell </v>

126
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.144
<v Speaker 1>people what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly think it would be </v>

127
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.493
<v Speaker 1>without courage to listen to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly making the same mistakes and </v>

128
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.334
<v Speaker 1>not encourage them to explore different </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenues and to see different vantage </v>

129
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:44.194
<v Speaker 1>points and that's something that I stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>true to within my therapy and it's </v>

130
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:48.214
<v Speaker 1>something that I think my own therapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was training was always the </v>

131
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 1>frustration.</v>

132
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.523
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like I wanted this person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was sharing the space with me to </v>

133
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>kind of fundamentally feel like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were with me.</v>

134
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.873
<v Speaker 1>I know that if you've not had therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have experienced that with </v>

135
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>your parents or your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be moments in your life where</v>

136
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you just feel that that person is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

137
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need to have words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just a sense of being.</v>

138
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And I used to feel a frustration that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never felt that.</v>

139
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>So potentially if I'm looking at it on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological level,</v>

140
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a level of me wanting to create</v>

141
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:26.261
<v Speaker 1>that experience for my client because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that everybody in life needs to be</v>

142
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.194
<v Speaker 1>able to replicate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think true happiness comes from </v>

143
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>feeling that you find are those that </v>
<v Speaker 1>share that space in that way and then if</v>

144
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:34.514
<v Speaker 1>you have had that in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go out and when you feel it </v>

145
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's good and you want to stick</v>

146
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something I think it's really</v>

147
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>important to almost transplant that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience into reality for the client.</v>

148
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say some bold things now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd come those bold things.</v>

149
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.253
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult for me to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>grand statements because I only know </v>

150
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be America like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America or in or broadly speaking,</v>

151
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>so privileged western democracy type </v>
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>

152
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health crisis going on.</v>

153
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Addiction epidemics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self harming,</v>

154
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>a in disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me like sort of a.</v>

155
00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:08.804
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's more information </v>

156
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.284
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's all sorts of social </v>

157
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.030
<v Speaker 2>factors and various contributors leading</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this statement.</v>

158
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 2>It seems like people are crying out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of connection to nature.</v>

159
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 2>One of the people are very much respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>to early guests on the show.</v>

160
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.843
<v Speaker 2>Adam Curtis says that politics is as </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost its ability to talk about feeling </v>

161
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 2>the way that people feel that politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>has become sort of managerial.</v>

162
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.781
<v Speaker 2>That people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

163
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:31.614
<v Speaker 2>we'll manage this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no real vision of where we're </v>

164
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 2>going and what sort of the great sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the last century,</v>

165
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.674
<v Speaker 2>sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great religious institutions have </v>

166
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 2>been challenged politic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great sort of experiments of fascism</v>

167
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:44.184
<v Speaker 2>and communism broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know once again we can say kind of </v>

168
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:52.281
<v Speaker 2>failed or certainly fascism revver level</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that and so like,</v>

169
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mental,</v>

170
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.143
<v Speaker 2>like psychiatry therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like in a way a relatively new </v>

171
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 2>science and its relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurology was an anatomy.</v>

172
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.374
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be ongoing as these </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections and observations and new </v>

173
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 2>maps and merge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But excuse me,</v>

174
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.763
<v Speaker 2>I feel that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work that's being done in </v>

175
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.893
<v Speaker 2>understanding how individuals feel in </v>
<v Speaker 2>how groups feel it's going to be vital </v>

176
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>in reforming the way that we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>

177
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 2>the way that we participate in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in society.</v>

178
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so emmy,</v>

179
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Emma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you have indicated,</v>

180
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.180
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't have the privilege</v>
<v Speaker 2>of engaging in therapy.</v>

181
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 2>So how do people employ these </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles?</v>

182
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 2>What should we be looking for?</v>

183
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that therapy is the ideal where </v>

184
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't need it not wanting to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my job,</v>

185
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>but ideally communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies and neighbors,</v>

186
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are around you,</v>

187
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>they can be the thing that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

188
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 1>And it would be my ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>the Nirvana would be that we support </v>
<v Speaker 1>people without the need for any of that.</v>

190
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.443
<v Speaker 1>I think the medical model in the UK and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Western world is something that </v>

191
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:05.424
<v Speaker 1>obviously has benefits to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're missing this vital </v>

192
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 1>link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is that when I'm working with</v>

193
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.310
<v Speaker 1>so many people who are maybe suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>from really,</v>

194
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:16.144
<v Speaker 1>really severe depression and anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have manifestations with </v>

195
00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:21.820
<v Speaker 1>eating disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

196
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.073
<v Speaker 1>when I'm hearing their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that compassion and empathy and </v>

197
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:29.643
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nurture and a real engagement with </v>

198
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.124
<v Speaker 1>getting to know the dysfunction and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the function from within </v>

199
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.654
<v Speaker 1>that dysfunction is what's required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that takes a huge amount of time </v>

200
00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:43.780
<v Speaker 1>when we're looking at it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic context.</v>

201
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Money as you noted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the NHS is really burdened.</v>

202
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.430
<v Speaker 1>You know anybody out there who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that practitioners aren't trying to do a</v>

203
00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:52.264
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it's just the amount of </v>

204
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.904
<v Speaker 1>people who genuinely need that care </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't receive and get and when you get </v>

205
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>that practitioner they're working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level crisis,</v>

206
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>do you not kind of doing the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention.</v>

207
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:05.044
<v Speaker 1>So for me the bigger question is how can</v>
<v Speaker 1>we as a society start to be more </v>

208
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>compassionate to people around us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big thing for me.</v>

209
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I always make an effort to get my note </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know my neighbors.</v>

210
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a northern thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a working class thing,</v>

211
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be living in now.</v>

212
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Let me interfere in your business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a trained therapist.</v>

213
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:32.154
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice you're not communicating very </v>

214
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 2>well when you live on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that would be one way of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

216
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.480
<v Speaker 1>but you know that kind of thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we have.</v>

217
00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:43.020
<v Speaker 1>These are measurable opportunity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society to make ourselves more healthy.</v>

218
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.093
<v Speaker 1>You said things like going outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even when you're working with people in </v>

219
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:48.744
<v Speaker 1>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big things that you want to </v>

220
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>do is look at their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at their exercise regime,</v>

221
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:53.064
<v Speaker 1>look at how often they get outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at who they socialize with because </v>

222
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.350
<v Speaker 1>human beings are human and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>social animals,</v>

223
00:12:58.351 --> 00:12:59.184
<v Speaker 1>and if they haven't got access to any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are they're not eating </v>

224
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>efficiently and they're not exercising </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

225
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.613
<v Speaker 1>that's manifesting more problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So helping people to deconstruct is one </v>

226
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:09.174
<v Speaker 1>of the things I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a therapist to explore </v>

227
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.743
<v Speaker 1>how to impact on your life more </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively through food or through the </v>

228
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:16.794
<v Speaker 1>amount of exercise you give yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white light that you get on your </v>

229
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:19.764
<v Speaker 1>skin or the Times that you knock on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor's door and ask for a cup of </v>

230
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:22.584
<v Speaker 1>tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that are within reach </v>

231
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:24.834
<v Speaker 1>to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even people who have low socioeconomic </v>

232
00:13:26.761 --> 00:13:29.610
<v Speaker 1>standards can still afford to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

233
00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:30.450
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

234
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.040
<v Speaker 2>What interests me about the work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do is you see that on this podcast a</v>

235
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very cerebral now know your sort of</v>

236
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.260
<v Speaker 2>a qualified clinicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like you know,</v>

237
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.000
<v Speaker 2>like not like I recognize that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>also communicate on that level,</v>

238
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but say you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking to people that are,</v>

239
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.820
<v Speaker 2>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional academics,</v>

240
00:13:53.821 --> 00:13:58.821
<v Speaker 2>it's likely you feel the weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>freight of their experience and study.</v>

241
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.193
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm like for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of the reason I'm doing </v>

242
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 2>this podcast because I do a degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion in,</v>

243
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.830
<v Speaker 2>in global politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as university,</v>

244
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:08.664
<v Speaker 2>when I'm sitting in someone's unpacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the upanishads for me or vedic </v>

245
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm always thinking and probably is</v>

246
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.640
<v Speaker 2>affecting my ability to learn is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>does this relate to me now?</v>

247
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Like you know me now out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I apply that if this doesn't apply to</v>

248
00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.510
<v Speaker 2>my experience of being human than a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

249
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.070
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

250
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.933
<v Speaker 2>like I know a lot of people will listen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this podcast where mental health is </v>

251
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Speaker 2>probably the thing that's uppermost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a lot of people listen to</v>

252
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.090
<v Speaker 2>these things for self betterment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to learn,</v>

253
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.043
<v Speaker 2>they want to know more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of people that are </v>

254
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:41.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

255
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.083
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy and like sort of self </v>

256
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:44.240
<v Speaker 2>harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating disorders,</v>

257
00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:45.320
<v Speaker 2>drink too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks so much.</v>

258
00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling alienated,</v>

259
00:14:46.851 --> 00:14:47.684
<v Speaker 2>feeling lost and like something like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy in her next door neighbor and ask </v>

260
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 2>for a cup of tea says something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of society we're living in that</v>

261
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>that's bloody sounds like quite radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

262
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.243
<v Speaker 1>It does feel like that for lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because we've kind of become so </v>

263
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>disassociated from to some degree what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us happy.</v>

264
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.233
<v Speaker 1>I also think we spend a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid difficult feelings </v>

265
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>because we've been told that difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings or something we should run from</v>

266
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:13.334
<v Speaker 1>or feel ashamed of or challenge in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>by using alcohol or drugs or sex or </v>

267
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>anything that helps us escape those </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

268
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that the years,</v>

269
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run away from all of the feelings that</v>

270
00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:28.554
<v Speaker 1>essentially I needed to confront so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could work through them and find why </v>

271
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:32.574
<v Speaker 1>feel is a piece with the part of me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I felt was dark and it's not </v>

272
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:40.020
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just human.</v>

273
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>But before I can reach others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to reach into myself.</v>

274
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I have to feel that connection with </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

275
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I can ask now and I asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for what I need if.</v>

276
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.883
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that I have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources within myself to manage </v>

277
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.033
<v Speaker 1>whether they reject me or otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's given me a </v>

278
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:02.174
<v Speaker 1>real freedom average to get there </v>
<v Speaker 1>through accepting that I was never ever </v>

279
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.093
<v Speaker 1>going to find what I wanted through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenues that I was seeking in the man </v>

280
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an aneurysm and having all of those </v>

281
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 1>areas of my world that I thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing me happiness,</v>

282
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 1>but that was so temporary and moment or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a that they really gave me,</v>

283
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what you were saying earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>on like that spiritual connection,</v>

284
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:24.224
<v Speaker 1>that sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that I think I'm really </v>

285
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little.in</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity,</v>

286
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>but that that's amazingly miraculous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the this moment is blink of an eye of my</v>

287
00:16:34.651 --> 00:16:35.484
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is mindblowing and taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and reframing it from that </v>

288
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>perspective has been incredibly helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

289
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.484
<v Speaker 1>because it gives me a humility where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that as long as I do as little </v>

290
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I've done</v>

291
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Speaker 2>a decent job and go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on,</v>

292
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.753
<v Speaker 2>go into a therapy session with as little</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage as possible with fuck every one </v>

293
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>smack in the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does.</v>

294
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.973
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying about </v>

295
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.030
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:17:06.031 --> 00:17:06.864
<v Speaker 2>the sort of miracle being and acceptance</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is difficult to resolve yourself </v>

297
00:17:09.871 --> 00:17:11.790
<v Speaker 2>outside of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get there though?</v>

298
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:12.624
<v Speaker 2>How did you get from being an adolescent</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a truman and inferred that </v>

299
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.110
<v Speaker 2>heaven is him played its part of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>

300
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.093
<v Speaker 2>How did you become disillusioned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had aneurysm and is it that </v>

301
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:27.180
<v Speaker 2>reached you because you said you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>initially,</v>

302
00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:28.014
<v Speaker 2>you were not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't feel satisfied with the </v>

303
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic experiences you had as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teenager.</v>

304
00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:34.620
<v Speaker 2>What you must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing,</v>

305
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:37.710
<v Speaker 2>have had some kind of satisfying </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with therapy at some point.</v>

306
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it was to do with the self work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I did so many years ago.</v>

307
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.593
<v Speaker 1>Not that I do this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of became quite intrigued with </v>

308
00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 1>things like the runic alphabet and using</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like an overview of a runic.</v>

309
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Every day I started writing to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journaling myself,</v>

310
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 1>learning that actually it was okay to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes.</v>

311
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.633
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things that I used to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is go to bed and over analyze every </v>

312
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>single conversation that I'd had for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear that I would have offended somebody</v>

313
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 1>and then everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

314
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>every day it was exhausting and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>learnt that actually,</v>

315
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

316
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.630
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter unless there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intent there late.</v>

317
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I might offend people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might upset people.</v>

318
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.703
<v Speaker 1>I might at times hurt people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my intention is not to accepting </v>

319
00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:27.941
<v Speaker 1>that I can't always be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another human being's pain or resolve or</v>

320
00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:32.080
<v Speaker 1>journey and instead the all I can do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>be with them on it.</v>

321
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Even if they reject me or if they accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

322
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the journey of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

323
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.473
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think having children was a big </v>

324
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.390
<v Speaker 1>awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say,</v>

325
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:43.190
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

326
00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:44.024
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago I had a baby and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought had meaning just totally </v>

327
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.064
<v Speaker 1>transformed like all I believed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until then was that though as this book </v>

328
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 1>search in life that there was this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>search for something,</v>

329
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that filled this gap,</v>

330
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that everyone runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and acid.</v>

331
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.263
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the minute I held him like I'd had </v>

332
00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:07.004
<v Speaker 1>no maternal experience or feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got pregnant because I was told I </v>

333
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:11.054
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one I'd always lived a life where if </v>

334
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you told me I couldn't do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would find a way to do it.</v>

335
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>That's still a philosophy I kind of live</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life by,</v>

336
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but I had fertility treatment.</v>

337
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.853
<v Speaker 1>I had a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I held him and I was blown away because </v>

338
00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>there was this magnificence of being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary,</v>

339
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.993
<v Speaker 1>ordinary miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just an everyday thing that people do </v>

340
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.710
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he changed everything.</v>

341
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Like he made me the best version version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of myself.</v>

342
00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:37.724
<v Speaker 1>He made me realize I was far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and patient that I even </v>

343
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.493
<v Speaker 1>knew I cut those resources to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of my children have consistently </v>

344
00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:46.924
<v Speaker 1>reminded me that I have an abundance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>love that I never even knew I could tap </v>

345
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>into and everybody finds something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>

346
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Some people find exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people find nature,</v>

347
00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.040
<v Speaker 1>some people find friendship for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherhood.</v>

348
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Motherhood was it.</v>

349
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You did thank you that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well you,</v>

350
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:08.264
<v Speaker 2>you said some things that are about in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way embracing convention and identity </v>

351
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.990
<v Speaker 2>because I've had a similar experience or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having quite new for me,</v>

352
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 2>still a similar experience as a parent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This like certainly disrupting myself.</v>

353
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Centerdness trying to stick to the self </v>
<v Speaker 2>centered but as someone.</v>

354
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.763
<v Speaker 2>Several people in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also earlier in it you talked </v>

355
00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:32.240
<v Speaker 2>about sort of like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what again,</v>

356
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:37.241
<v Speaker 2>as I say like often when I'm talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like academics and stuff in here,</v>

357
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.320
<v Speaker 2>if like runic letters or the itching </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up,</v>

358
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.463
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would like you clear off because </v>

359
00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

360
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.470
<v Speaker 2>we live in a that don't really like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize sort of folk.</v>

361
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.981
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

362
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:54.814
<v Speaker 2>Folk history and something I'm becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more interested in and I know </v>

363
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:58.631
<v Speaker 2>that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

364
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:03.631
<v Speaker 2>given that you are a psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is interesting,</v>

365
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:04.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

366
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 2>That I'm fascinated by Carl young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated with.</v>

367
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 2>He's intrigued with like Kundalini Yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the itching and ways of dealing with</v>

368
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:19.021
<v Speaker 2>the mystery because let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown is where we all get to.</v>

369
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

370
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 2>sort of a debate or a conversation I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose between Sam Harris,</v>

371
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>the atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that neurologist and sort of pundit and,</v>

372
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and Richard Dawkins and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about how,</v>

373
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:34.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the sort of the beauty of the </v>

374
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 2>theory of evolution and it's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of his magnificent.</v>

375
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:39.664
<v Speaker 2>The way I'm packed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our understanding of sort of material </v>

376
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 2>evolution of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a great masterpiece in determining </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of like,</v>

378
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like of course it says that,</v>

379
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

380
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.693
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how it begins or how it </v>

381
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 2>can begin this moment of inception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some point,</v>

382
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we all have to interface with the </v>

383
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 2>unknown and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

384
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.143
<v Speaker 2>I suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I sort of feel like I know that </v>

385
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 2>there are limitations for our capacities</v>
<v Speaker 2>as human beings to hold knowledge,</v>

386
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but knowledge is potential for </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

387
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>is infinite capacity for understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>is fine,</v>

388
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 2>that there's going to be faith is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be required,</v>

389
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 2>a way of dealing with the unknowable is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a requirement now like when,</v>

390
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.253
<v Speaker 2>if we have a type of culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibits that because it's seen as woo </v>

391
00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:31.760
<v Speaker 2>woo or sort of like.</v>

392
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I think actually one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sensing is it sort of a part of this</v>

393
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:36.934
<v Speaker 2>is to do with Patriarchy and misogyny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oppression of the female principal </v>

394
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.903
<v Speaker 2>of the flow of things in a male nurse is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a self contained idea in a </v>

395
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:47.884
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The female femininity as it relates to </v>

396
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 2>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both biologically and socially is a sort</v>

397
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:57.440
<v Speaker 2>of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It I sent down,</v>

398
00:22:57.441 --> 00:22:58.274
<v Speaker 2>I'm being very basic here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is kind of a flow to the idea </v>

399
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 2>of femininity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

400
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this printer,</v>

401
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.650
<v Speaker 2>how men can embrace their own femininity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>

402
00:23:09.651 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminine principle being bought into</v>

403
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.803
<v Speaker 2>life and it like as sort of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas of connectedness that you </v>

404
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

405
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.943
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is the significance </v>

406
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 2>and how can we learn more and how can we</v>
<v Speaker 2>enact them?</v>

407
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that the men this modern age is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a confusing one.</v>

408
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I think there have been so many changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more androgyny.</v>

409
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Women obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rightfully so,</v>

410
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 2>at least getting to a point where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is more equality,</v>

411
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.953
<v Speaker 2>certainly not equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the western world there is more </v>

412
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:41.104
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the thing that men need to </v>

413
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge is that firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human</v>

414
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>animals and the need for connection is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely instinctual.</v>

415
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.991
<v Speaker 1>It's not about them being weak because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need somebody to support them.</v>

416
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.403
<v Speaker 1>When they vocalize their pain and men </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't vocalize their pain as often </v>

417
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 1>as they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it kills them.</v>

418
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why suicide is such a high rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in men under 40 for example,</v>

419
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually taking that step,</v>

420
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.103
<v Speaker 1>that brave step to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pain to say I don't know what to </v>

421
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.184
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say I'm confused with all these </v>

422
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes and schemers about what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man should be.</v>

423
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you become at one with yourself,</v>

424
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:26.354
<v Speaker 1>male or female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recognize the very thing that you </v>

425
00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 1>need as a human is to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mess.</v>

426
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:33.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mess sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within that mess is something </v>

427
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:37.394
<v Speaker 1>incredibly beautiful masterpiece based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell all my clients and particularly </v>

428
00:24:42.061 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>in the man who struggled with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity and the ability to just say</v>

429
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:47.024
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pain and to not know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to acknowledge that that's a </v>

430
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>completely generic feeling.</v>

431
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.043
<v Speaker 1>That's the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody tells me they know exactly </v>

432
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 1>why they're here and they know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing,</v>

433
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>then I think that they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest with themselves.</v>

434
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

435
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.613
<v Speaker 1>it's the wonder of not knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes life the journey that becomes the </v>

436
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:07.874
<v Speaker 1>potential to make everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in this world feel that it </v>

437
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 1>has something more guttural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cerebral,</v>

438
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's something more,</v>

439
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's okay.</v>

440
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the not knowing of knowing to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

441
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.913
<v Speaker 1>so what do men need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they need to trust themselves </v>

442
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:26.084
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to trust that you don't need </v>

443
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:28.484
<v Speaker 1>to have the answers to find a way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be people around you who </v>

444
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 1>will offer you that spark of support and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way that we can start that</v>

445
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 1>is when we give permission to each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>to follow that through.</v>

446
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:41.803
<v Speaker 1>So for every man to give another man </v>
<v Speaker 1>that permission for every woman to meet </v>

447
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:49.430
<v Speaker 1>that permission with care and compassion</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not just a male thing.</v>

448
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Speaker 1>If we want our men to be protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>

449
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak and vulnerable.</v>

450
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women want to be leaders as well,</v>

451
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.550
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time the androgynous </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused and,</v>

452
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's why we're having</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of these problems because it's a</v>

453
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>very simple process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acknowledge how you feel.</v>

454
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Tell some day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocalize it,</v>

455
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 1>received the support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work up,</v>

456
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>support a move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an atb experience,</v>

457
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly a place that begins </v>
<v Speaker 1>the change we need to connect more.</v>

458
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 1>We choose not to is a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's a choice.</v>

459
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're choosing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which using not to.</v>

460
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 1>We're in a tender world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a throwaway world,</v>

461
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.553
<v Speaker 1>a world where actually deep connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that's almost becoming </v>

462
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.953
<v Speaker 1>avoided just because there is so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>able connection that isn't really with </v>

463
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.590
<v Speaker 1>those things are compromised and goes.</v>

464
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 1>As human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.873
<v Speaker 1>we used to be this kind of really small </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people as you would know and </v>

466
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you know who did use things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>divination,</v>

467
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.453
<v Speaker 1>things that kind of made sense to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that community that worked </v>

468
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that in the past and yet for some</v>

469
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 1>reason with materialism and capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you said,</v>

470
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:04.524
<v Speaker 1>the politics and let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where it doesn't serve us to </v>

471
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 1>care for people because that's the wider</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

472
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.874
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't serve people who are doing </v>

473
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:17.040
<v Speaker 1>well to some degree to care for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are not.</v>

474
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And yet the answer is that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

475
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And everyone who really thinks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that.</v>

476
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It curious how on a sort of a very basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

477
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:27.924
<v Speaker 1>things like eat the food that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>season in the place where you're living </v>

478
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Speaker 1>is like a sort of good for you because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

479
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.763
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of a little code that's </v>

480
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:36.560
<v Speaker 1>all there.</v>

481
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.140
<v Speaker 1>So if a food's known season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's haven't been transported,</v>

482
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it won't be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

483
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 1>so I wonder if there is an analogy with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

484
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:50.931
<v Speaker 1>with compassion and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of a subtler forms of feeling.</v>

485
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.373
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to ask you about sex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality both as a therapist and as I </v>

486
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.550
<v Speaker 1>am mother of both your sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>

487
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two teenage boys.</v>

488
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

489
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you're a therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You produce,</v>

490
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.193
<v Speaker 1>so like gender and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were recovered with time where all </v>

491
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:18.760
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff is being repoed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reexamined.</v>

492
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.643
<v Speaker 1>And so like as a mother of two sons who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are presumably at a point where these </v>

493
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of ideas are integral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

494
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of instruction,</v>

495
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>what kind of work do you see your role?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

496
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:32.484
<v Speaker 1>in my role as a mom since day when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to have conversations with them </v>

497
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 1>about everything.</v>

498
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who judges me for that.</v>

499
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.903
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who judges me because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day I'll talk to them </v>

500
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:41.634
<v Speaker 1>about porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to them about what a girl </v>

501
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 1>will want on the first day and what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely won't want.</v>

502
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.613
<v Speaker 1>I talk about the political standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are given to women as far as their </v>

503
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>objectification of their bodies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexualization of young girls.</v>

504
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 1>The expectations young girls put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

505
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.503
<v Speaker 1>I constantly tell them that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the future generation of </v>

506
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 1>young men and that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently accept that women girls are</v>

507
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 1>equals and I'm absolutely honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'll still,</v>

508
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm so honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 1>they know what porn is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know why porn exists.</v>

510
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.673
<v Speaker 1>They know what that does some degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and they accept the things that </v>

511
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 1>they see if they see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>

512
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we're looking for in </v>
<v Speaker 1>good relationships.</v>

513
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you want in a relationship is </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

514
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Whatever suits your fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay in a loving,</v>

515
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:32.604
<v Speaker 1>committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected relationship or at least in a </v>

516
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 1>mutually respectful relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

517
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you think then that the porn is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex?</v>

518
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:42.410
<v Speaker 1>What our action movies to life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

519
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.373
<v Speaker 1>and if so because I've started to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of porn is very sort of toxic and </v>

520
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing and I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with it.</v>

521
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:49.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I find it hard to not look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography and it's one of the things I</v>

523
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>think that shouldn't look at porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Porn is bad,</v>

524
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.883
<v Speaker 1>but like if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also are you less puritanical </v>

525
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.023
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that porn is necessarily </v>

526
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:05.900
<v Speaker 1>bad because I think that it has a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in chain Cina.</v>

527
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>We're obsessed with bodies.</v>

528
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.953
<v Speaker 1>We like watching people have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We liked the fact that people have </v>

529
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.074
<v Speaker 1>different interactions and fantasy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really important and particularly for </v>

530
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.343
<v Speaker 1>men and women who like to have visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus when that happened to </v>

531
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>masturbate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be really,</v>

532
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:18.994
<v Speaker 1>really helpful for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I don't like about porn is it </v>

533
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:22.264
<v Speaker 1>consistently places the woman on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole as a submissive and it also </v>

534
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:26.974
<v Speaker 1>suggests that women like certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've never met a client </v>

535
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 1>particularly who likes the fact that 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>men are going to come on their face.</v>

536
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that's not something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the average one wants,</v>

537
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 1>but that kind of footage is viewed again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again and again.</v>

538
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that must be the men when </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at pornography?</v>

539
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>The fear must be a component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting if,</v>

540
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:48.934
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Paul needs to demonstrate men as </v>

541
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:51.940
<v Speaker 1>being powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to move it.</v>

542
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.773
<v Speaker 1>It might be catering for the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>men feel impotent and powerless trying </v>

543
00:30:56.141 --> 00:31:00.790
<v Speaker 1>to redress that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a an a bias in pornography to</v>

544
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 1>men being powerful because in effect men</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel powerless and impotent and afraid.</v>

545
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.153
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really good way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing it and when I feel almost </v>

546
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:13.300
<v Speaker 1>like there's an underlying rage within </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn when I see some of it,</v>

547
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I constantly look online to see </v>

548
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of what is being mirrored out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

549
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:19.174
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what expectations would be informed </v>

550
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:21.034
<v Speaker 1>on 15 year old boys and girls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the expectations and what </v>

551
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 1>they should want in relationships or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one night stands or whatever.</v>

552
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel this like rage that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have to abuse her.</v>

553
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>We have to destroy her to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has to enjoy it even though it's not</v>

554
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.083
<v Speaker 1>clearly enjoyable and that concerns me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also suggests that there is some </v>

555
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:47.491
<v Speaker 1>kind of change in the way that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing out our sexual fantasies.</v>

556
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I want people to realize that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fantasy,</v>

557
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.350
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as it is respectful.</v>

558
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>As long as the other person is premium </v>
<v Speaker 1>party to that,</v>

559
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to be within that fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

560
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody should be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of exploring it.</v>

561
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I constantly teach my clients that shame</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the worst thing you can have in sex,</v>

562
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:13.630
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things about porn is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's a big part of it.</v>

563
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:18.631
<v Speaker 1>That same rage and shame that we almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>play out these things on screen that are</v>

564
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.553
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is shame find its way into </v>

565
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:23.524
<v Speaker 1>sexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're shocked because we're </v>

566
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:25.864
<v Speaker 1>ashamed of our sexuality early in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we are taught shamed so </v>

567
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:30.934
<v Speaker 1>much in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from day one you are told that </v>

568
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>sex is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only do it at this age.</v>

569
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You should only do it for this reason.</v>

570
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.823
<v Speaker 1>You should only do that with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection that you kind of have this </v>

571
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:43.070
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then at the same time,</v>

572
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.170
<v Speaker 1>because we don't just have these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

573
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 1>honest conversations when kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

574
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often does somebody go into a </v>

575
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 1>classroom and talk honestly about sex?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk honestly about relationships.</v>

576
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 1>So honestly about how good it is and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad it can be so that you've kind of got</v>

577
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:58.964
<v Speaker 1>rid of any need for the shame and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged with everybody in a way that </v>

578
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:04.154
<v Speaker 1>they can acknowledge they don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel stupid or embarrassed or </v>

579
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:07.154
<v Speaker 1>humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We formed those norms because our mates </v>

580
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>at school are kind of making us feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we're doing,</v>

581
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:15.584
<v Speaker 1>if we're having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's promiscuous or what we're doing if </v>

582
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>we don't have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frigid.</v>

583
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of conversations occur </v>
<v Speaker 1>because adults aren't guiding them.</v>

584
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.683
<v Speaker 1>Like how do we help kids grow into young</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women who love sex and embraced </v>

585
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 1>it for what it is and feel no shame.</v>

586
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.290
<v Speaker 1>We do it by just being honest with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are horrified about that.</v>

587
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

588
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.194
<v Speaker 1>let's just start educating them from day</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and people think you're stealing </v>

589
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:44.300
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not stealing childhood.</v>

590
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.583
<v Speaker 1>Your creating solid allard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adults who can become well adjusted in </v>

591
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:50.714
<v Speaker 1>the way that they feel about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you do that sort of with a </v>

592
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.373
<v Speaker 1>group?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I suppose the reason that </v>

593
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:56.670
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

594
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.503
<v Speaker 1>the suggestion or you're still in </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood is because it's like these </v>

595
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 1>children are not interested in sex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your imposing it on them,</v>

596
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:03.494
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's an argument of normally like </v>

597
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.093
<v Speaker 1>around in a way enforcing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing norms around types of </v>

598
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.054
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it like in clause 28 being a </v>

599
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:14.310
<v Speaker 1>famous example of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

600
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.173
<v Speaker 1>don't teach kids that are almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality is normal because otherwise </v>

601
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:20.710
<v Speaker 1>they'll find out that it's normal.</v>

602
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 1>so I suppose the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you teach a group like a group of</v>

604
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:29.714
<v Speaker 1>children because presumably there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>children that have different </v>

605
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of curiosity around sexuality.</v>

606
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:37.100
<v Speaker 1>How can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you teach it?</v>

607
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that you teach it early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

608
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 1>really early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say honestly,</v>

609
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.600
<v Speaker 1>five years old onwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about having sex at five</v>

610
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:46.970
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about what sex is,</v>

611
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.580
<v Speaker 1>how you arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why your born.</v>

612
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.720
<v Speaker 1>That starts the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation by when kids.</v>

613
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Because presumably what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

614
00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 1>when I was thinking about it before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was answering,</v>

615
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:56.384
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking right when I would teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>my kid about sex will be when the kid </v>

616
00:34:58.371 --> 00:34:59.740
<v Speaker 1>asks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

617
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.583
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't talk about when they ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>because children are full of fear </v>

618
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.863
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that so many adults forget to </v>

619
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 1>look back to how it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I can remember clearly when I was four </v>
<v Speaker 1>and five years old,</v>

621
00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I used to suffer from really terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticks as a child.</v>

622
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.733
<v Speaker 1>Like I had really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad touch which have been </v>

623
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.813
<v Speaker 1>twitching about our terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible techs have every single one of </v>

624
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:24.850
<v Speaker 1>them from linking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next let's try to getting.</v>

625
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was anxiety.</v>

626
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a physical eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to feel anxiety.</v>

627
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:31.904
<v Speaker 1>So I use text to manifest that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was because I was so aware of </v>

628
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.940
<v Speaker 1>everybody else's judgment around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would say things to me and open.</v>

629
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember a guy saying to my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

630
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>she's such a funny girl that was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was far.</v>

631
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.613
<v Speaker 1>I was five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've looked back on those times and </v>

632
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.093
<v Speaker 1>always transplanted the recognition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids out there that everyone </v>

633
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.700
<v Speaker 1>thinks it just these naive little </v>
<v Speaker 1>players in life,</v>

634
00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.633
<v Speaker 1>they're hypersensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive and they're having these </v>

635
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:02.784
<v Speaker 1>conversations and they're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships and they haven't a clue why </v>

636
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 1>the world's working the way that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

637
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 1>But you know what you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make them feel so safe.</v>

638
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Adults can make kids feel so safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was working on projects where the</v>

639
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 1>young people had had no education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were involved in the criminal</v>

640
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:20.400
<v Speaker 1>justice system where people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely given up on them.</v>

641
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.563
<v Speaker 1>The first job that I had was to make my </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys and girls feel safe because it was </v>

642
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 1>a feeling that everyone assumes people </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

643
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but very few people really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

644
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.760
<v Speaker 1>By being authentic is number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By reassuring them that they're okay.</v>

645
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Even when some of that actions are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

646
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that fundamentally within them there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an okayness that we can find that and we</v>

647
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 1>can manifest it and that they can move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

648
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.363
<v Speaker 1>My boys and girls and I say my boys more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than my girls because my 80 percent of </v>

649
00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 1>my boys came to the projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 percent were girls.</v>

650
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So I run um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime concerned projects.</v>

651
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I run college projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Pru,</v>

652
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:02.783
<v Speaker 1>pupil referral unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when kids had failed in mainstream </v>

653
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would come to me,</v>

654
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.410
<v Speaker 1>but they would come to me after that </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed in a mainstream pru.</v>

655
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:11.880
<v Speaker 1>So I got the Pru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pru,</v>

656
00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:16.881
<v Speaker 1>kids and I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember my life that are low.</v>

657
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.600
<v Speaker 1>That's wild though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.350
<v Speaker 1>well I remember like those times with </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

659
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I honestly in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

660
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still keep in contact with some of the</v>

661
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 1>young people if I'm honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time since I worked on those</v>

662
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:29.154
<v Speaker 1>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I recognized immediately was </v>

663
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 1>that they hated me when they first </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought,</v>

664
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 1>they hated me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

665
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 1>one called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was called posh batch was number one,</v>

666
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:41.840
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm not working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my accent was different to theirs,</v>

667
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.133
<v Speaker 1>but it was okay.</v>

668
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's a scowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been kicked out,</v>

669
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you go to when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked out or things you might feel like</v>

670
00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 1>audrey hepburn after rex Harrison is my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair lady,</v>

671
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>but you know what result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the key.</v>

672
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 1>The key to me was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always being myself,</v>

673
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.110
<v Speaker 1>always using the opportunity to inspire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to take away my boys particularly.</v>

674
00:38:05.111 --> 00:38:05.944
<v Speaker 1>You had had their self esteem eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to such a degree that but nine years </v>

675
00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't in the classroom.</v>

676
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:10.974
<v Speaker 1>They were sent outside to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know how to read and why at </v>

677
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:13.681
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

678
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:14.461
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>

679
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>If you can't read and write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like you belong.</v>

680
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't have access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shamed.</v>

681
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.410
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible and that's the other thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about academia as well.</v>

682
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Academia is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are really bright.</v>

683
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.213
<v Speaker 1>They seek out and suit themselves with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that area of expertise and it's </v>

684
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it creates a elite.</v>

685
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 1>My boys would look at people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

686
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.870
<v Speaker 1>even people with gcse is let alone </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctorates and professorships.</v>

687
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.123
<v Speaker 1>They would see an us and them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole experience in life with my </v>

688
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:49.744
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the young people I had the </v>

689
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>privilege to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my children,</v>

690
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.393
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be as an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to feel like there is no </v>

691
00:38:57.911 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are human,</v>

692
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>therefore we're equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may know this and you may know that,</v>

693
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but there is something intrinsic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say to every single client that I have</v>

694
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 1>when they're questioning themselves more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than nature,</v>

695
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:10.654
<v Speaker 1>as you brought up nature before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has their own opinions on </v>

696
00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

697
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I think nature has an answer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything.</v>

698
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.554
<v Speaker 1>I think she's incredibly bright and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows exactly what she's doing and why </v>

699
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 1>she's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether we see those solutions or choose</v>

700
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:23.854
<v Speaker 1>to ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether politically we're allowed to </v>

701
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:28.280
<v Speaker 1>have those solutions or have them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>help from us.</v>

702
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestion,</v>

703
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:30.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I know is that every </v>

704
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:32.914
<v Speaker 1>single human being out of all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of people have one thing to </v>

705
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:36.064
<v Speaker 1>print.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't for one minute believe that </v>

706
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:43.291
<v Speaker 1>mother nature decided to give every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single human being a marketing so unique</v>

707
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.570
<v Speaker 1>to them that that wasn't reason and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

708
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I teach every single child that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with.</v>

709
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.283
<v Speaker 1>Every client you were marked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were marked with something that </v>

710
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 1>stands you out from every other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding it is the issue.</v>

711
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Finding it of beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that word communicate.</v>

712
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 1>It means create community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Create connection.</v>

713
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're good at doing that.</v>

714
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Then it was this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so add to get rid of them.</v>

715
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.463
<v Speaker 1>Terrible ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a phrase that when it first </v>

716
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:17.134
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure called Constellation in an </v>

717
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 1>audio medium that might be a new teller </v>
<v Speaker 1>for show.</v>

718
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually terrible ticks presented by Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenney with several ticks,</v>

719
00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but do self down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm higher,</v>

720
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I terrible texture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am still happy.</v>

721
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Where's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are your tie control them?</v>

722
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 1>How sometimes I go to the toilet and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back for a bit.</v>

723
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I still have my texts I have is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's physicalized anxiety.</v>

724
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So I'm quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I don't really feel low.</v>

725
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't really feel anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm aware that like anybody,</v>

726
00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I have a certain amount of stresses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strains in my world and my life,</v>

727
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 1>so my brain kind of just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

728
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 1>just give yourself a bit of a twitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than twitches and I do,</v>

729
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.693
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can still remember my mom when I was </v>

730
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 1>seven years old and I was quite a cute </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid with blonde pigtails,</v>

731
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but mum was working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

732
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.830
<v Speaker 1>a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great mother and she would put my</v>

733
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:15.650
<v Speaker 1>hair in pigtails.</v>

734
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 1>She put me in a red coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She always coordinated everything.</v>

735
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:19.660
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she made a real effort.</v>

736
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Me and my sister would look like we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of quite well to do kids,</v>

737
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking down the road and then I would </v>

738
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 1>cough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do my neck,</v>

739
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:27.963
<v Speaker 1>do molag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw my shoulders out and she would </v>

740
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:30.214
<v Speaker 1>just look at me with absolute despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a correlation between those </v>

741
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:38.831
<v Speaker 1>two things with what Darwin you up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and you twitching eye out like some</v>

742
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 1>little punk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>

743
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.374
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to verbalize my pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the time there were certain </v>

744
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:45.974
<v Speaker 1>things in my life that felt painful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a way of using my body to </v>

745
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:52.094
<v Speaker 1>express my sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only learning now quite late in </v>

746
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:56.174
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How muck of it being a person too much </v>

747
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:01.800
<v Speaker 1>or in the intellect and the body is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where so much happened.</v>

748
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 1>So you go get into your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

749
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing for me.</v>

750
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That has been a huge learning curve for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

751
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.313
<v Speaker 1>I used to analyze everything I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that I had to work out every </v>

752
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:14.324
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic piece and cellular experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had and it created so much noise </v>

753
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and volume and what I've learned to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more recently is find this acceptance of</v>

754
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:23.894
<v Speaker 1>silence and switching off and allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself to kind of meditate on how my </v>

755
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:28.154
<v Speaker 1>body feels like how my body feels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not how my mind is and it's been so </v>

756
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:34.880
<v Speaker 1>soothing and so helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop Mindfulness of course,</v>

757
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

758
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.813
<v Speaker 1>like do Jujitsu and I'm probably one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best people ask it in the world by </v>

760
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.600
<v Speaker 1>one hour a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hour,</v>

761
00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 1>where are like body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

762
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my body and like sort of I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically close to another man </v>

763
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.740
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

764
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.573
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our love it what you said before </v>

765
00:42:55.101 --> 00:43:00.101
<v Speaker 1>about sex that is probably a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of describing how the perfect sexual</v>

766
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:01.634
<v Speaker 1>encounter is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're not in your head is </v>

767
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:05.840
<v Speaker 1>when you're fully engaged with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

768
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Speaker 1>When you see yourself as playing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having pleasure and getting pleasure and</v>

769
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:11.564
<v Speaker 1>having no shame and just allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself the experience whether that's </v>

770
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 1>in a one night stand or a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed relationship and it's possible</v>

771
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to work through all of that</v>

772
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:26.860
<v Speaker 1>volume and get to a position where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept your body before can move forward</v>

773
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 1>or how do you block the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a return to a point that we,</v>

774
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:31.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we started.</v>

775
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:36.281
<v Speaker 1>But then you sort of terrible ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for meditation like,</v>

776
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like introducing the subject of </v>

777
00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:41.324
<v Speaker 1>sexuality of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said don't wait for them to ask </v>

778
00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

779
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Start introducing this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

780
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 1>W how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have conversations with them.</v>

781
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a very early age,</v>

782
00:43:49.131 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I started to talk about the anatomy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my body,</v>

783
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:52.783
<v Speaker 1>my children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a single mom for quite a long </v>

784
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:57.170
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a single mom I had one bathroom in</v>

785
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:58.004
<v Speaker 1>my home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that my children always saw </v>

786
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:00.284
<v Speaker 1>me naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started to have conversations with </v>

787
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:05.270
<v Speaker 1>them about my body so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood what my boobs were,</v>

788
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:06.283
<v Speaker 1>what my vagina was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still laugh at the word vagina </v>

789
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>because we really had fun back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day discussing all of those things,</v>

790
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:16.280
<v Speaker 1>the differences about that bodies then </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they came about,</v>

791
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 1>why they existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what sex was and why it was and why</v>

792
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:21.794
<v Speaker 1>sex is something that they should one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day enjoy and always feel that I'm the </v>

793
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:28.010
<v Speaker 1>person they can come and converse with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the barrel,</v>

794
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:31.280
<v Speaker 1>that both my boys are 13 and 15.</v>

795
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I created them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot better than I probably </v>

796
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>deserved if I'm really honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

797
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:37.074
<v Speaker 1>they're great kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that strikes me </v>

798
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:42.960
<v Speaker 1>about them is their emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and they do not have fear.</v>

799
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>They do not have the fear that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>about asking,</v>

800
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son will talk to me about porn.</v>

801
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 1>He'll talk to me about the fact that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends are talking about sex.</v>

802
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>He'll have conversations with me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and it's so,</v>

803
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 1>so reassuring because it was simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was simple.</v>

804
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I just made the communication clear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no shame,</v>

805
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 1>no embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was open.</v>

806
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because you want imagines </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will not,</v>

807
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:10.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that child's going to go into an </v>

808
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:13.410
<v Speaker 1>environment where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a moment ago,</v>

809
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:16.260
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the kind of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists in the world of porn,</v>

810
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the kind of access but young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>

811
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.510
<v Speaker 1>girls are going to have to pornography.</v>

812
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:25.200
<v Speaker 1>But he's giving them some given a </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious,</v>

813
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usual on my assumption is dangerous </v>

814
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.950
<v Speaker 1>messages are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is your life,</v>

815
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel as a therapist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is My prejudices Mr Kenney human being.</v>

816
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.343
<v Speaker 1>But how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is like a sort of a natural </v>

817
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 1>understanding of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

818
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.223
<v Speaker 1>Julie consensual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving adult play where we communicate </v>

819
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:50.450
<v Speaker 1>how like how's it going to survive that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of institutional a deviation.</v>

820
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I fully believe that human beings know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to find that way.</v>

821
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I have a hope consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

822
00:45:59.791 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 1>how'd you work in certain circumstances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

823
00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:06.120
<v Speaker 1>with sexual abuse or with murdered </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

824
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:06.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that that people would </v>

825
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:09.810
<v Speaker 1>really struggle to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you work with it?</v>

826
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's because I always have a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hope.</v>

827
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:13.163
<v Speaker 1>My belief system is hope orientated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that no matter how much you </v>

828
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:21.801
<v Speaker 1>present people with these caricatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these characatures of sexuality,</v>

829
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:23.184
<v Speaker 1>these characatures of having sex on </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen in such a way that very few </v>

830
00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Speaker 1>people would ever want to encounter.</v>

831
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want it.</v>

832
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:33.210
<v Speaker 1>We desensitize ourselves to it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>

833
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.283
<v Speaker 1>I hope that women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if porn continues to hold itself in our </v>

834
00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:38.304
<v Speaker 1>society as it seems to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that women start to feel that </v>

835
00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:46.770
<v Speaker 1>they should be involved in directing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating because fantasy is lost.</v>

836
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 1>There is no fantasy in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so physical and mechanical.</v>

837
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.320
<v Speaker 1>There has to be something deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask a question like,</v>

838
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.330
<v Speaker 1>because we hear this idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that is a one vision of female</v>

839
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 1>empowerment is women being involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of pornography,</v>

840
00:47:03.151 --> 00:47:03.984
<v Speaker 1>but in a sense isn't that a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coopting of femininity into a mountain </v>

841
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.830
<v Speaker 1>bike because like you know when you sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of say,</v>

842
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise a May being prime minister,</v>

843
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.600
<v Speaker 1>is that good for feminism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was Margaret Thatcher being present?</v>

844
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's good that women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in politics,</v>

845
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:24.291
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like like it's not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the job that we're trying to do.</v>

846
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I have a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

847
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would much rather what we have in our </v>

848
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 1>society is a far better relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sex.</v>

849
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.143
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that every young person growing </v>

850
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:45.211
<v Speaker 1>up and every adult could learn early on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel that their body is an incredible</v>

851
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 1>tool that something they can really </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to.</v>

852
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:48.904
<v Speaker 1>They can enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could have experiences in society </v>

853
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>where people can go to lessons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have sessions with people where</v>

854
00:47:55.901 --> 00:47:58.840
<v Speaker 1>they can really construct an identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the sexuality,</v>

855
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.823
<v Speaker 1>whether it was correct help for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who unfortunately have horrible sexual </v>

856
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

857
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:05.643
<v Speaker 1>the statistic is harrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in six children are sexually abused </v>

858
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 1>before the age of 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in four girls,</v>

859
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 1>one in eight boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

860
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 1>So people are growing up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional identity towards sex.</v>

861
00:48:16.361 --> 00:48:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of it is the unraveling.</v>

862
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.713
<v Speaker 1>And when you say about porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn kind of volumizes the negatives as </v>

863
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.034
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of wish that there was more </v>

864
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 1>regulation around that because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get rid of porn,</v>

865
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.883
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to see women as equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>players because you get these really </v>

866
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:37.441
<v Speaker 1>kind of stereotypical vibes about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>women should want and it's turning the.</v>

867
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this sounds awful by.</v>

868
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I say to people when I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

869
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 1>you never been talking to younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

870
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect anal sex and fisting when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have sex for the first time.</v>

871
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not what women want and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should feel you're pressured to</v>

872
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:53.224
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're watching this kind of </v>

873
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that's your learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

874
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely think that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential in the room scenario.</v>

875
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 1>What pressure for guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what pressure for girls,</v>

876
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.420
<v Speaker 1>so to some degree it's the regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will that ever happen?</v>

877
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Of course not because it makes a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and money will always be the </v>

878
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:11.674
<v Speaker 1>bigger winner in life is extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we have to incorporate these </v>

879
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 1>external influences on what is governing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flow of what is normal,</v>

880
00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>what's determining normality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting when something comes up</v>

881
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 1>as a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

882
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.650
<v Speaker 1>a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word in a podcast as listing.</v>

883
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:29.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

884
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Please don't apologize for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

885
00:49:31.361 --> 00:49:32.194
<v Speaker 1>Like I record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I once heard about when there was </v>

886
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 1>earlier attempts to regulate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic content for fisting was one</v>

887
00:49:39.161 --> 00:49:39.994
<v Speaker 1>of the things that they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>without considering the role that that </v>

888
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:49.111
<v Speaker 1>plays in nonheterosexual communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

889
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.083
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So regulation can often be used as a </v>

890
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:53.644
<v Speaker 1>tool to normalize as opposed like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having open conversations about </v>

891
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 1>what sex is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sex should be,</v>

892
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.613
<v Speaker 1>but it's very important that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>remains open and inclusive and </v>

893
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.653
<v Speaker 1>nonjudgmental about different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and the thing that I heard </v>

894
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:12.680
<v Speaker 1>that made most sense to me was consent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consent,</v>

895
00:50:12.681 --> 00:50:15.400
<v Speaker 1>consent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who can't give consent,</v>

896
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:18.340
<v Speaker 1>children and a more mentally ill people.</v>

897
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think though that the whole porn area,</v>

898
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.120
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those places that could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

899
00:50:25.121 --> 00:50:27.880
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be something that could inspire or</v>

900
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it could be somebody that could free </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and allow us our fantasies,</v>

901
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 1>but to some degree the fact that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people feel intense.</v>

902
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Shame watching porn plays into that dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche anyway.</v>

903
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:38.563
<v Speaker 1>So I would like to see more people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalizing the conversations around </v>

904
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:46.120
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about talking about that preferences,</v>

905
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 1>about expressing their fantasies without</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

906
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so much fear built up </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the sexual arena.</v>

907
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:53.913
<v Speaker 2>And Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much because I think </v>

908
00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:58.690
<v Speaker 2>communication is going to be vital in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all areas of mental health,</v>

909
00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.553
<v Speaker 2>all forms of human expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Verbal and sexual and it feels to me </v>

910
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:05.620
<v Speaker 2>like the way that we relate to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings,</v>

911
00:51:05.621 --> 00:51:06.454
<v Speaker 2>the way that we relate to forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression is vital in this time of </v>

912
00:51:09.281 --> 00:51:10.114
<v Speaker 2>disjunct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this time of Fisher separation </v>

913
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.000
<v Speaker 2>conflict in so many fields like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

914
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.510
<v Speaker 2>to once again find union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but between people that no matter only I</v>

915
00:51:19.511 --> 00:51:23.670
<v Speaker 2>suppose start with communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What an incredible journey it's been.</v>

916
00:51:23.671 --> 00:51:28.671
<v Speaker 2>It seems for you from a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicator to communicate.</v>

917
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:34.463
<v Speaker 2>I think you should have your own podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that should be the strap sex talk </v>

918
00:51:38.551 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 2>obviously will be the title wherever </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny,</v>

919
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:45.270
<v Speaker 2>but the strap from what was that a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a congruent communicator.</v>
