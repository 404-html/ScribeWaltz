00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 2>not under the skin with Russell brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guest today is Frankie Boyle.</v>

3
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.111
<v Speaker 2>Frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

4
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 2>really happy to have you on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you a bit.</v>

5
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.253
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you in our email exchange</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I saw a sensitivity in you that </v>

6
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.164
<v Speaker 2>much belied and contradicted your public</v>
<v Speaker 2>persona even when you were sort of more </v>

7
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] than me in the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>sphere.</v>

8
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I thought there's something about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>man is incredibly sensitive and tender,</v>

9
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 2>so this is a suppose and disarming </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduction is what I'm doing I think.</v>

10
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty close to see who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of telephone from the head by head.</v>

11
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know with both had our fair share.</v>

12
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Heavenly of public vilification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do,</v>

13
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that you're back on,</v>

14
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean do you still consider yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be back in the mainstream television?</v>

15
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Not me.</v>

16
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not taller.</v>

17
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Considered myself to be like less secure</v>
<v Speaker 2>than ever.</v>

18
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 2>What did you mean that emotionally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally or professionally or both but</v>

19
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.944
<v Speaker 2>also professionally you just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the minute you're kind of out and </v>

20
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 2>doing stuff in a very can amend stream </v>
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 2>the minute you step out say what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>

22
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.054
<v Speaker 2>you would just be completely destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like I'm kind of dancing on </v>

23
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the edge of a cliff or bet you feel that</v>
<v Speaker 2>day when you're doing something like the</v>

24
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>autopsy or tv autopsy your are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>centering yourself?</v>

25
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:40.854
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had it for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that monologue you did about threes in </v>

26
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 2>May on in fact a cliff edge and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gail,</v>

27
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I thought one of the things I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bad,</v>

28
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:47.874
<v Speaker 2>you're right in is the poetry and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>succinctness it conjuring images that </v>

29
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 2>are humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I potent and I've sort of thing.</v>

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh that will stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll bark people that that has been </v>

31
00:01:58.921 --> 00:01:59.754
<v Speaker 2>said about him but now you do you find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you centering the saying you're </v>

32
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>dancing on a cliff edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel it was that self censorship?</v>

33
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.663
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like there does it for me usually </v>

34
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and a out like writing for the Guardian </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

35
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It just ended up being like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific,</v>

36
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.953
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get prey common or garden</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in there because I think if the </v>

37
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 2>education can education system can uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please select for conformity.</v>

38
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea that you know,</v>

39
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>by the time you reached the top in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>

40
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you've already gone through so many pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>selections for your conformist while you</v>

41
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 2>fill in the test where you turn up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill every day,</v>

42
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.843
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's a conformist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like sometimes in entertainment I </v>

43
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.574
<v Speaker 2>think that can appease leg for neurosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're kinda going through </v>

44
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 2>several peoples what he's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other people might think,</v>

45
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.033
<v Speaker 2>and by the time you were scrapped riches</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're just kind of freaking out </v>

46
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>about nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

47
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:51.954
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is a degree of neuroses and </v>

48
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 2>indeed sensitivity that is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibitive.</v>

49
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>But there's so about like the</v>

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 3>creative process that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it requires like a connection to what </v>

51
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.534
<v Speaker 3>you actually believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we were corresponding for a little </v>

52
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 3>while and email like I'm member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked briefly about the idea,</v>

53
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.693
<v Speaker 3>like my somewhat more romantic idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedian is shaman and like </v>

54
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 3>accessing new realms of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you said something about,</v>

55
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was something about that,</v>

56
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.054
<v Speaker 3>about describing of a world that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt was somewhat dangerous and that </v>

57
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.774
<v Speaker 3>what needed to be done with the frosted </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe accurately the world are </v>

58
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.464
<v Speaker 3>actually in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that just the past in Forza </v>

59
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 3>philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philosophical mainstay?</v>

60
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

61
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

62
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.850
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some of the most interesting ideas,</v>

63
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

64
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of danger isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

65
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shamanism and,</v>

66
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly quite shamans.</v>

67
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

68
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.973
<v Speaker 4>how'd you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's that whole thing of like </v>

69
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:52.094
<v Speaker 4>cultural erasure and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And us just being at that as we see it </v>

70
00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:57.284
<v Speaker 4>at the top of some tree where every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every idea in existence is part of our </v>

71
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 4>mid board for our personal philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can,</v>

72
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.070
<v Speaker 4>it dictates against them</v>

73
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.933
<v Speaker 3>the standard stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you mean white there as a synonym </v>

74
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.650
<v Speaker 3>for power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it was sort of like a there that we</v>

75
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:13.040
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are selecting for like all culture is</v>

76
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:13.874
<v Speaker 3>a mood board from which were selected </v>
<v Speaker 3>strands and obfuscating or ignoring </v>

77
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.590
<v Speaker 3>their cultural origins.</v>

78
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost think you don't need to use </v>

79
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 4>white as a synonym for power justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Nim.</v>

80
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

81
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.443
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see this interesting thing with it at </v>

82
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 4>the minute and we're no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people talking about Ah,</v>

83
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

84
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 4>you're not white privilege doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really exist.</v>

85
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.180
<v Speaker 4>You know what if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

86
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:40.014
<v Speaker 4>a white guy who was born in this century</v>
<v Speaker 4>action and all that kind of stuff and </v>

87
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 4>you think the thing about real </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppression is those people don't need to</v>

88
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 4>fantasize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

89
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 4>if you really oppressed to that whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing of like,</v>

90
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get that from,</v>

91
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.660
<v Speaker 4>from white people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly white people was a platform</v>

92
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.730
<v Speaker 4>and they're sort of going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

93
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 4>what if it's a paralyzed white guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he works for Oprah?</v>

94
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just know like,</v>

95
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>

96
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.274
<v Speaker 4>if you were black,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't need to make a fantasy to </v>

97
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.004
<v Speaker 4>have your depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you would just go out on the </v>

98
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.640
<v Speaker 4>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started the taxi,</v>

99
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm an empty white,</v>

100
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.653
<v Speaker 4>white people come up with imaginary </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppresses like the Illuminati and you </v>

101
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got to,</v>

102
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.310
<v Speaker 4>we've got to create something because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

103
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 4>we don't have it in the same way.</v>

104
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Is your general worldview optimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankie?</v>

105
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:23.694
<v Speaker 3>What's that happened to you after like </v>
<v Speaker 3>working in media fire don't for maybe </v>

106
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:27.324
<v Speaker 3>it's 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it that you've been doing this kind </v>

107
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 3>of stuff like that it still feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive and optimistic about change?</v>

108
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.713
<v Speaker 4>I think you solved domestic but most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people heat in it would think it's </v>

109
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 4>incredibly depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was mistake.</v>

110
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 4>I could lay it on you quick quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I think like um,</v>

111
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.113
<v Speaker 4>maybe a whole reality is like a math for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a and the materialism and </v>

112
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:51.924
<v Speaker 4>commodification are mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keynes way of trying to express in </v>

113
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:59.640
<v Speaker 4>metaphor the fact we are trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 4>motto that we are sped.</v>

114
00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:00.474
<v Speaker 4>It now has to live in Martin and die and</v>
<v Speaker 4>go through all that kind of stuff and </v>

115
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.274
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the actual facts of life is </v>

116
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.354
<v Speaker 4>we've constructed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I simply sort of metaphoric responds to </v>

117
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's some people may think that's</v>

118
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 4>incredibly depressing bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of it like when I was a teacher,</v>

119
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I did teach her training for bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an alcoholic.</v>

120
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 4>I remember like seeing my arm writing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chalkboard one day and thinking,</v>

121
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a teacher,</v>

122
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.543
<v Speaker 4>my teachers and I almost had an body </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and could see myself doing </v>

123
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 4>this thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to,</v>

124
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I've got to go to this job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

125
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's when I started doing comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I almost think,</v>

126
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphor of existence,</v>

127
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 4>materialism is sort unsurvivable that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to go over it.</v>

128
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.540
<v Speaker 4>That was sort of almost half to </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend mater.</v>

129
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's a really positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

130
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

131
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.113
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this sort of transcend ben or </v>

132
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 3>moment there at the chalkboard art </v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher training,</v>

133
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:53.494
<v Speaker 3>you add a pithany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've heard described as the </v>

134
00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 3>revelation of essence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly the essence becomes plain tee.</v>

135
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 3>They all know that that's a teacher's </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm.</v>

136
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.643
<v Speaker 3>I'll know it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Maya on where they are one and the </v>

137
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:07.210
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked this idea,</v>

138
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.163
<v Speaker 3>the on some level we are conscious that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are spirit traps in Matt and </v>

139
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.300
<v Speaker 3>materialism is merely the metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression of this.</v>

140
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.730
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually,</v>

141
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I want to say,</v>

142
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 3>frustrated by irritate by an almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the,</v>

143
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the precipice of a hysterical toddler</v>

144
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:22.774
<v Speaker 3>tantrum about is that invoke comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left lacks a kind of mythic </v>

145
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:28.354
<v Speaker 3>imagination that in opposing austerity </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a kind of an austerity of a </v>

146
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to say vision that it seems</v>

147
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:41.161
<v Speaker 3>sometimes a little bit flat and a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit droning the for me,</v>

148
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.784
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're just talking about your </v>

149
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>transactions between bureaucracies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>different type of imagination,</v>

150
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.200
<v Speaker 3>then what is the point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want some vivid,</v>

151
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.063
<v Speaker 3>lucid dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want people to talk about different </v>

152
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:53.824
<v Speaker 3>realms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want basically to take Ios Iosk and </v>

153
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.880
<v Speaker 3>experience machine elves dabbling with </v>
<v Speaker 3>layers of reality,</v>

154
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:01.714
<v Speaker 3>but I can't drink or take drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I caught so it's no longer open to </v>

155
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:04.720
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

156
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.441
<v Speaker 4>Black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

157
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:06.640
<v Speaker 4>Birds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also this thing for,</v>

158
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.474
<v Speaker 4>it's like sometimes that slightly </v>
<v Speaker 4>humorless leftist thing also turns </v>

159
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:12.394
<v Speaker 4>itself to critique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh the other people's attempts to find </v>

160
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 4>narratives and metaphors and things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>resonate with people.</v>

161
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.870
<v Speaker 4>So it's okay to be boring but to sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and go,</v>

162
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we don't just try it.</v>

163
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.533
<v Speaker 4>I think metaphors can be incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful site in the 1968 riots in </v>

164
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:29.014
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was partly to do with society of </v>

165
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:33.520
<v Speaker 4>the spectacle and get the ball and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>his slogans were choked on the walls and</v>

166
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that</v>

167
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.930
<v Speaker 3>just exploded because you do know a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more about that cause I'm into that.</v>

168
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that [inaudible] I'm into him </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he said one thing I read about him</v>

169
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.104
<v Speaker 3>the other day was saying that the media </v>
<v Speaker 3>and technology at south deeply </v>

170
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.781
<v Speaker 3>corporatized the old data within it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily imbued with,</v>

171
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:50.684
<v Speaker 3>it's your agenda and you can see that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media that even if people are </v>

172
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey that's me in this square and riot,</v>

173
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.720
<v Speaker 3>the an advert for trainers may very well</v>
<v Speaker 3>accompany and the he's,</v>

174
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.733
<v Speaker 3>he's procube age than the medium is </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibited by its origins and by its </v>

175
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.424
<v Speaker 3>ownership.</v>

176
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.400
<v Speaker 4>So has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hazel was saying was like this bag,</v>

177
00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Speaker 4>the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

178
00:09:08.391 --> 00:09:09.224
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it says just the site that you can </v>

179
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Speaker 4>escape the spectical so every ton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even that's what we're doing,</v>

180
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:18.200
<v Speaker 4>talk hummus is high in this back corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Podcasters book ended by adverts.</v>

181
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.780
<v Speaker 4>He would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

182
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.303
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

183
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.141
<v Speaker 3>He signed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be,</v>

184
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 3>it's inescapable that our role while </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at work,</v>

185
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:27.654
<v Speaker 3>we are workers when we're at home with </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumers with designated roles that </v>

186
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 3>prevent us from having an authentic </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction with reality,</v>

187
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 3>an authentic experience of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So don't you like it?</v>

188
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.453
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting for me to watch from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outside how your role at least </v>

189
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 3>externally just as a fan and a consumer </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your work is like,</v>

190
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:45.541
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

191
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.730
<v Speaker 3>frankie boyle initially is this mood </v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of a fella.</v>

192
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.713
<v Speaker 3>There's making shocking joke working </v>
<v Speaker 3>class Scottish person making sort of </v>

193
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 3>pre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

194
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 3>would want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see hearing jokes,</v>

195
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.333
<v Speaker 3>sacred cows to topics and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be a reemergence of </v>

196
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.850
<v Speaker 3>political commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

197
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.860
<v Speaker 3>as a sensitivity and an a real depth of </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis and deep cultural understanding</v>

198
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the gone,</v>

199
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.063
<v Speaker 3>some sort of personal epiphany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or have you always been like this and </v>

200
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 3>just felt emboldened more recently to </v>
<v Speaker 3>express yourself more truthfully?</v>

201
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've always been like late us,</v>

202
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:21.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you will never see little </v>
<v Speaker 4>fragments of it slit most people,</v>

203
00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 4>if we think about how we relate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

204
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:23.844
<v Speaker 4>so I was reading an article yesterday or</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to read an article by Roger </v>

205
00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 4>mcguinn turf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

206
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.570
<v Speaker 4>so regimen golfs on the Guardian website</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I fucking hate vagifem of golf.</v>

207
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.850
<v Speaker 4>And I started to redesign a call and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought to myself,</v>

208
00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:36.670
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should I actually been to this guy?</v>

209
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:40.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think it seemed like reading some </v>
<v Speaker 4>poems on a children's show 20 years ago,</v>

210
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 4>if I was totally honest with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just so dead.</v>

211
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.583
<v Speaker 4>It isn't an intellectual exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like his glasses and he seemed </v>

212
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:48.304
<v Speaker 4>a bit smug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of the level that most </v>

213
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:51.910
<v Speaker 4>people relate to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to be honest,</v>

214
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:54.340
<v Speaker 4>if you ask most people to relate to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than that,</v>

215
00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:56.980
<v Speaker 4>you're a bit of an egotist and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are perfectly,</v>

216
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.130
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly fine that they can hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>one joke they don't like and hear you.</v>

217
00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm quit don't with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

218
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.653
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always done like political stand </v>

219
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:05.954
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like people tend to take it </v>

220
00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 4>one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see,</v>

221
00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you didn't choose whether his edits and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they show the best thing.</v>

222
00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

223
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.553
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't think that you have </v>

224
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:16.130
<v Speaker 3>essentially change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you've been categorized and</v>

225
00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:18.620
<v Speaker 3>pieced together differently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a time where it was convenient</v>

226
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 3>there for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was frankie boyle,</v>

227
00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:20.954
<v Speaker 3>shocking comic and now it's convenient </v>
<v Speaker 3>because everyone's a bit more bruised </v>

228
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:26.870
<v Speaker 3>and anxious to have frankie boyle voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

229
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.090
<v Speaker 3>the off authentic voice of the people.</v>

230
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I think everybody matures as bad,</v>

231
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.510
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's also that thing of,</v>

232
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I think I do tasteless stuff other than </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like offensive stuff.</v>

233
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.560
<v Speaker 4>So it's the idea of like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction.</v>

234
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 4>What would it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would it be?</v>

235
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Late we say civility because civility is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bit of a bore really now it's fine.</v>

236
00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:45.404
<v Speaker 4>That bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first meet people of getting </v>

237
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:51.350
<v Speaker 4>beyond the niceties to be Beva can a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chore and then use it later.</v>

238
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Passenger are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

239
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.233
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think in society we have that as </v>

240
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:55.984
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But part of the problem is if you're a </v>

241
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 4>comedian and you've got working class </v>
<v Speaker 4>background,</v>

242
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.233
<v Speaker 4>you've got regional accent and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with tastelessness taste is a </v>

243
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 4>social marker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he cute?</v>

244
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 4>This is the main social marketing brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then immediately it's like,</v>

245
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just didn't fucking jokes and the</v>

246
00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy savile or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

247
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 4>well I'm not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all you can hear.</v>

248
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sort of time Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really need the people who,</v>

249
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 4>who can get it to come to the shores.</v>

250
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.903
<v Speaker 3>So you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again that that's about like forms </v>

251
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:26.480
<v Speaker 3>of taxonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is it,</v>

252
00:12:26.481 --> 00:12:29.330
<v Speaker 3>because like if you make a joke about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy savile row in a particular accent,</v>

253
00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.010
<v Speaker 3>they won't be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same way as if that,</v>

254
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.110
<v Speaker 3>that same joke was made in a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>accent where we are.</v>

255
00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 3>This is interesting cultural critique </v>
<v Speaker 3>review.</v>

256
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:35.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

257
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.283
<v Speaker 3>that's crass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Bolga did you ever see them </v>

258
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.120
<v Speaker 3>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grayson Perry done about taste and class</v>

259
00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:41.954
<v Speaker 3>and it was actually exemplified </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly the point that you've just </v>

260
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:48.110
<v Speaker 3>made because class is quiet class and </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste.</v>

261
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.840
<v Speaker 3>I suppose whilst they're systems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorization,</v>

262
00:12:50.841 --> 00:12:53.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a tendency from be a bit or more</v>
<v Speaker 3>first like,</v>

263
00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 3>well he sort of said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:54.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

265
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.460
<v Speaker 3>it was a rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

266
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 3>in some ways it was reductive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbara,</v>

267
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but it was really articulate and clear </v>
<v Speaker 3>for as far as I could see,</v>

268
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.500
<v Speaker 3>like you been lucky in working class </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>

269
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welfare's exhibit it.</v>

270
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.291
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

271
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 3>you get Larry Tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goldie loud,</v>

272
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:12.450
<v Speaker 3>noisy cars where materialism has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed because necessarily because of</v>

273
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:15.650
<v Speaker 3>scarcity middleclass it gets sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

274
00:13:15.651 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes more sophisticated.</v>

275
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.550
<v Speaker 3>The coat and the signals become more </v>
<v Speaker 3>discreet.</v>

276
00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It was talking to interior design,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fashion,</v>

277
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.450
<v Speaker 3>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you send an f class.</v>

278
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.403
<v Speaker 3>People were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dress like I'll ratbags new motto of </v>

279
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.673
<v Speaker 3>Tech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was sort of like a polo </v>

280
00:13:27.231 --> 00:13:28.064
<v Speaker 3>mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make everyone come in some bad old </v>

281
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Volvo or Jim Morris miners with bits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wood on them and like,</v>

282
00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were proper,</v>

283
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.480
<v Speaker 3>proper loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I see an interesting that,</v>

284
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.314
<v Speaker 3>cause what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that taste is sort of the art of the </v>

285
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.190
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that you're wearing,</v>

286
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:42.050
<v Speaker 3>the way that you decorate your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

287
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.993
<v Speaker 3>a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went around and he's like working </v>

288
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.013
<v Speaker 3>costs woman's house and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look a these horse brassieres and </v>

289
00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Speaker 3>this poor things I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very goldie and elegant,</v>

290
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So kitsch display of taste.</v>

291
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.783
<v Speaker 3>And if anybody was interesting how it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an almost exact like how you could </v>

292
00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:00.680
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is an interesting marker.</v>

293
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.543
<v Speaker 3>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use it as a barometer is </v>

294
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 3>legitimize me is genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

295
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I that's interesting.</v>

296
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Must Watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

297
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I think is w as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a kind of further stage two,</v>

298
00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:12.254
<v Speaker 4>which is if you middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only the only people who can really </v>

299
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:15.734
<v Speaker 4>impress other people with purchasing </v>
<v Speaker 4>power or really poor people and really </v>

300
00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:20.210
<v Speaker 4>rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know as if you really pair,</v>

301
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you get a nice car and if you really </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought you get and your and your,</v>

302
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:24.524
<v Speaker 4>your social group or impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you middle class people would pretty </v>

303
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.290
<v Speaker 4>in a place where they can only express </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves through the test.</v>

305
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.420
<v Speaker 4>So you taste becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

306
00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.410
<v Speaker 4>And I think when you align that with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that we didn't necessarily,</v>

307
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.244
<v Speaker 4>but it's very difficult to live morally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if my taxes are going to bomb sedia </v>

308
00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:44.804
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if my taxes are going to lakeview slide </v>

309
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.100
<v Speaker 4>front page of the times to the nacs </v>
<v Speaker 4>death squad,</v>

310
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 4>you know how you I live a moral life or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's to my tastes.</v>

311
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.030
<v Speaker 3>You may want to pay lower taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how on earth are we to fund our sas?</v>

312
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.470
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

313
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Sas Dead Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

314
00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:03.311
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

315
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I do a fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're quite right now,</v>

316
00:15:05.501 --> 00:15:09.130
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder how that relates to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying about materialism and an</v>

317
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 3>endless commodification and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

318
00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:14.134
<v Speaker 3>like you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sit here and we make this pot of </v>

319
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.040
<v Speaker 3>podcasts now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Autodidacts though we may be,</v>

320
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.410
<v Speaker 3>we're evidently adept at pontificating </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing it as you know,</v>

321
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 3>in some cases on some occasions though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not this one for a hunt,</v>

322
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:28.240
<v Speaker 3>some living here by like where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is it that,</v>

323
00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:31.930
<v Speaker 3>where are you resourcing your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose now?</v>

324
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.793
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you won?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it that you want to do as a </v>

325
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:35.590
<v Speaker 3>comic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause like,</v>

326
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things is I still believe in,</v>

327
00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I do believe in the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

328
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:41.014
<v Speaker 3>I believe in a evangelist sees him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that you can enthuse people </v>

329
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.880
<v Speaker 3>probably in ways that a rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

330
00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:46.714
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was just interview Noemi Klein </v>

331
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:47.890
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went,</v>

332
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.750
<v Speaker 3>you're this part of bloody problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 3>You Miss Lunatic.</v>

334
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.133
<v Speaker 4>Well I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was struck by this thing at </v>

335
00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Speaker 4>rate and a grant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morrison comic musical one good mine can</v>

336
00:15:58.781 --> 00:15:59.614
<v Speaker 4>make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it just the end of the story </v>

337
00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:01.864
<v Speaker 4>archive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think I'm trying to </v>

338
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:03.784
<v Speaker 4>evangelize to people in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that thing of if you do </v>

339
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:08.770
<v Speaker 4>something and test in that has meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

340
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:09.604
<v Speaker 4>it can be that one person I could not </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch and things like Alex Cox is say </v>

341
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 4>video or maybe drama or whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 4>called it.</v>

342
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 4>What did he just show his favorite </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies and BBC two but she wouldn't even</v>

343
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:19.774
<v Speaker 4>get that kind of thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like just just things like that had </v>

344
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:25.780
<v Speaker 4>a big impact on how I see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

345
00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:30.550
<v Speaker 4>And if you can change how one person </v>
<v Speaker 4>sees the white old not might've been off</v>

346
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.183
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if we don't really understand </v>

347
00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:36.900
<v Speaker 3>the true nature of being there so or off</v>
<v Speaker 3>the manifest world,</v>

348
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm I suppose to sort of even to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is a global narrative that we</v>

349
00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:44.460
<v Speaker 3>can interact with an intersect with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph for them.</v>

350
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Sort of endless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite subjectivities,</v>

351
00:16:47.521 --> 00:16:48.354
<v Speaker 3>all tangled up and occasional narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fritz memetically sleeping across the </v>

352
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know.</v>

353
00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:54.114
<v Speaker 3>I suppose like when you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you get an interview bio </v>

354
00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:58.530
<v Speaker 3>and Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who has a much clearer,</v>

355
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

356
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a clearer idea of narrative to sort</v>

357
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 3>of a traditional idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of respect of the left,</v>

358
00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:06.624
<v Speaker 3>how do you think like someone like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's talking about talking about the </v>

359
00:17:09.331 --> 00:17:11.250
<v Speaker 3>spectacle took her out in the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

360
00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:12.084
<v Speaker 3>talking about that sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you sound a little bit </v>

361
00:17:14.071 --> 00:17:14.904
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic if I may say so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think nihilism is quite a positive </v>

362
00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:19.080
<v Speaker 3>thing is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

363
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.973
<v Speaker 3>go on.</v>

364
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.440
<v Speaker 4>Starts off is like existential nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 4>of going well.</v>

365
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:23.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

366
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing else you might as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>

367
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:27.610
<v Speaker 4>This is as good as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

368
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:30.250
<v Speaker 4>So it's a kind of a branch or </v>
<v Speaker 4>existential ism.</v>

369
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Originally I think it's only since the </v>
<v Speaker 4>90s whatever that people have started to</v>

370
00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:35.530
<v Speaker 4>see it as a death cult.</v>

371
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.603
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it becomes a bit decadent and </v>

372
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 3>had any stick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well there's no purpose.</v>

373
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Why as we'll stick this out and Obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kick that falls over.</v>

374
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as well,</v>

375
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.990
<v Speaker 4>you have to be careful about saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's have a narrative and let's have a,</v>

376
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 4>a thing where we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a thing we're like,</v>

377
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.430
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alan Mirror the comic book rate,</v>

378
00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:52.264
<v Speaker 4>I'll talks about m r is propaganda for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of mind is really [inaudible] </v>

379
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

380
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.283
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time you've got to be </v>

381
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 4>careful with that because who do you </v>
<v Speaker 4>propagandize too?</v>

382
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 4>You don't propagandize Tutti calls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not persuasion.</v>

383
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 4>It places you in a [inaudible] of a week</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a design a narrative that you know,</v>

384
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 4>poor people are going to fan too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is gonna make the world bear.</v>

385
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 4>And the thing with that is people can </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it if you don't,</v>

386
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 4>if you don't approach it from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>possession of equality and going,</v>

387
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I help?</v>

388
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

389
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:26.870
<v Speaker 4>you're suddenly putting yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchical possession of hey,</v>

390
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.680
<v Speaker 4>that create a story that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

391
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:29.514
<v Speaker 4>which is what most political parties are</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and what most really politically </v>

392
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.760
<v Speaker 4>motivated commentators are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always,</v>

393
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I think people see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People see that you're trying politicize</v>

394
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:39.594
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

395
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I say I'm a bit grandiose of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I'm always thinking,</v>

396
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:46.030
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some letter about like,</v>

397
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.903
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it feels like it's an essential part </v>

398
00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:51.500
<v Speaker 3>of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say sometimes to my counselor.</v>

399
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I know it's much of what I do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>driven by ego.</v>

400
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I know it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not only that,</v>

401
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.400
<v Speaker 3>there's something else there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I admit that there's the ego.</v>

402
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the grandiosity I've met,</v>

403
00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:04.334
<v Speaker 3>I want the adulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the past I wanted this more </v>

404
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:06.920
<v Speaker 3>audit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

405
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.330
<v Speaker 3>all vs anatomical manifestations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnal manifestations.</v>

406
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.550
<v Speaker 3>But like all of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all of these,</v>

407
00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I have now been stripped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stripped,</v>

408
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:16.694
<v Speaker 3>and landed in domestic city and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think I've ever been happier than being </v>

409
00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:23.830
<v Speaker 3>a father and a partner in a recognizable</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of way,</v>

410
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.093
<v Speaker 3>but still this yearning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems to me to be not perhaps </v>

411
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 3>these systems of categorization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these delineations are also arbitrary,</v>

412
00:19:31.641 --> 00:19:34.040
<v Speaker 3>but seems to be more than he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Ego,</v>

413
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Ego plus something of the mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something of the magical,</v>

414
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.220
<v Speaker 3>something that I'm still craving.</v>

415
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.360
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd find this reductive or </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilistic,</v>

416
00:19:43.361 --> 00:19:44.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a good thing,</v>

417
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like David Eick cool side too,</v>

418
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like David Dykes,</v>

419
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.770
<v Speaker 4>so beer in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know you need things like,</v>

420
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:52.604
<v Speaker 4>because a lot of people are less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of various people in power </v>

421
00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:57.760
<v Speaker 4>and sort of country western singers for </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who's in our lessons,</v>

422
00:19:57.761 --> 00:19:59.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

423
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Like David dykes kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious figure.</v>

424
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.420
<v Speaker 4>So he's like a guy who's had a religious</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

425
00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:06.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's a goalkeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

426
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.130
<v Speaker 4>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he frames it in a particular way.</v>

427
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.533
<v Speaker 4>I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like the guy who wrote the </v>

428
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Bible has to believe the metaphor is </v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

429
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like that's why it has its power of </v>

430
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.990
<v Speaker 4>David date has to believe like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not ramp tales,</v>

431
00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good way of thinking of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they'd behave like red tail.</v>

432
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he does have to,</v>

433
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:25.550
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I like you,</v>

434
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.910
<v Speaker 3>you've met everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like haven't you?</v>

435
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:28.531
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

437
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've named several times and I,</v>

438
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously fascinated by David dike.</v>

439
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.220
<v Speaker 3>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

440
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.053
<v Speaker 3>I so much voices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he preempted to hold off the off </v>

441
00:20:37.571 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 3>the knee like zones of things that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said we're going to happen.</v>

442
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.171
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

443
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>there's not mince words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophile rings,</v>

444
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like David,</v>

445
00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I've said this all be it within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment industry.</v>

446
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 3>That's he swept paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I run it,</v>

447
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 3>it runs deep people in children's homes </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

448
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.713
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admittedly that was book ended with a </v>

449
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 3>love of lovely stuff about lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I agree with what you're saying</v>

450
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 3>is that he's almost like unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphor labor.</v>

451
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Cause because David Eick you've pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got,</v>

452
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

453
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.473
<v Speaker 4>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that maybe the messianic thing </v>

454
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.110
<v Speaker 4>isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to understand that as a kind</v>

455
00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:07.944
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I can totally change the world by </v>

456
00:21:08.821 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 4>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to have an actual effect on whatever</v>

457
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 4>as a few thousand people that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>energize.</v>

458
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to believe that to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

459
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.273
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a like go see if Hitler suddenly </v>

460
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 3>had there sort of a moment of going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

461
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 3>this is mental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Hitler.</v>

462
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>It'd be meant to be metaphorical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

463
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:32.521
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you see the death camp that they are</v>

464
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:37.190
<v Speaker 3>a bridge too far for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come for all tying.</v>

465
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Let Nick Crow politics played to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

466
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.010
<v Speaker 3>We've built one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

467
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:42.844
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps he had a frankie boyle </v>

468
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.853
<v Speaker 3>moment of looking at his own sieg </v>
<v Speaker 3>heiling hand and like you writing on a </v>

469
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 3>chalkboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't hit La.</v>

470
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 3>What have I done to myself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe them.</v>

471
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:57.843
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to take the metaphor out of </v>

472
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be absolute and real.</v>

473
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you read some of the ones where it's </v>

477
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 3>like Hillary Clinton and going down on </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and all of this,</v>

488
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Never explained or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Well surely you should after you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken it.</v>

490
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.563
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bloody Great John Elvino Lizard and </v>

491
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.863
<v Speaker 3>bumped someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if it's an underage person </v>

492
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't possibly have consented </v>
<v Speaker 3>mom.</v>

493
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lucky had some rich to some rich,</v>

494
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 3>rich stuff in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some interesting things.</v>

495
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 3>What did it come in and what else did </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

496
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 3>what did you think when you met him?</v>

497
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:59.330
<v Speaker 4>And I was like in Portsmith and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>just seems like a pretty normal dead,</v>

498
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but there's definitely my ad fan had </v>
<v Speaker 4>kindergarten backstage.</v>

499
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.263
<v Speaker 4>A Ne was like talking to me and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>David Aic was stuck behind them in the </v>

500
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 4>corridor looking at me like this bloke's</v>
<v Speaker 4>and nuts.</v>

501
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Let's get away from this Weirdo right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

502
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Then the queen mum bombed another kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a phoenix.</v>

503
00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:21.250
<v Speaker 3>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

504
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

505
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.340
<v Speaker 3>well I've found fascinating is as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

506
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 3>as I say this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't like to be mean about David.</v>

507
00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so colorful.</v>

508
00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Some of this imagery that like when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

509
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I was just surprised by actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

510
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.523
<v Speaker 3>how sort of ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was almost some drum members that we </v>

511
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:40.110
<v Speaker 3>watched football with him and we went </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the white right.</v>

512
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.123
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a FAA Cup games to </v>

513
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:44.900
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a couple of championship </v>
<v Speaker 3>level teams and him and his,</v>

514
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

515
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

516
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:47.234
<v Speaker 2>They need to be playing a bit wider and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so Saturday drinking tea and being sort </v>

517
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 2>of very ordinary while sat on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

518
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.024
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of great volcano of lucid </v>

519
00:23:58.701 --> 00:23:59.534
<v Speaker 2>imagery and powerful mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the mundane is hugely </v>

520
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.693
<v Speaker 2>underrated because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got stuff to sell us all the </v>

521
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

522
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.141
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

523
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 2>imagine how much better</v>

524
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.240
<v Speaker 4>honey part would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

525
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 4>a comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

526
00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:15.820
<v Speaker 4>if it was just a bad kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then his teacher,</v>

527
00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 4>how many get a bus to the edge of town </v>
<v Speaker 4>to face some demons or some stuff.</v>

528
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I had just all been a real chore</v>

529
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.620
<v Speaker 2>and then having to top up their oyster </v>
<v Speaker 2>cards are much better.</v>

530
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.370
<v Speaker 2>You think that he in the ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the real,</v>

531
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.000
<v Speaker 2>there could be somehow more potency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really good.</v>

532
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Then those children's books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

533
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.613
<v Speaker 2>Alan Gardner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheatstone of pressing almond and nine </v>

534
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.200
<v Speaker 2>my right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a trilogy in it.</v>

535
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 2>So first one is called [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>

536
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.823
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

537
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:44.993
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brother and sister who are fighting </v>

538
00:24:47.311 --> 00:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>against this watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

539
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.120
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the go through the old maths,</v>

540
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.120
<v Speaker 2>can I say calls Colin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Challenges like that and it,</v>

541
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.410
<v Speaker 2>and then he'd rates a sod one like of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 30 years later,</v>

542
00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.253
<v Speaker 2>just before he dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the boy grown up going to </v>

543
00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:01.824
<v Speaker 2>his therapist and he's not able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really remember any of it and they just </v>

544
00:25:04.201 --> 00:25:05.034
<v Speaker 2>think he was like nuts as a kid and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>sister disappears at the end of the </v>

545
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.320
<v Speaker 2>second book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous watch.</v>

546
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And he just never really finds out </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether she dead there,</v>

547
00:25:12.661 --> 00:25:14.700
<v Speaker 2>whether she does or if he's just lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind.</v>

548
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It sort of normalizes it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

549
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:18.480
<v Speaker 2>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

550
00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to check those out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that Frankie.</v>

551
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.150
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me think about it because I spent</v>

552
00:25:24.151 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit while we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about I can,</v>

553
00:25:26.581 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a bit untethered from myself.</v>

554
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I had to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about,</v>

555
00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:37.710
<v Speaker 2>like on sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps a more or ordinary level,</v>

556
00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.770
<v Speaker 2>these moments of disruption that we seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be experiencing that they're sort of,</v>

557
00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:41.604
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

558
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 2>the terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Grenfell Tower,</v>

559
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>which you spoke to own Jones about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.343
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is revealed by these </v>

561
00:25:52.321 --> 00:25:54.120
<v Speaker 2>events?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is becoming a parent?</v>

562
00:25:54.121 --> 00:25:56.700
<v Speaker 2>What is becoming manifest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's been previously concealed.</v>

563
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.800
<v Speaker 4>I think people are more widely </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognized and just high letell.</v>

564
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.903
<v Speaker 4>This system that is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>nominally care for them can't even be </v>

565
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:09.494
<v Speaker 4>bothered to pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for some reason there seems to be a </v>

566
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:13.304
<v Speaker 4>deference between a government is </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to pretend to care and a </v>

567
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 4>government that can't even be bothered </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pretend the care,</v>

568
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.010
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that the grand for residents</v>

569
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:24.440
<v Speaker 4>got their rent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doctored this month for example,</v>

570
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.743
<v Speaker 4>you know the idea they could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tried to throw them out of their </v>

571
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.441
<v Speaker 4>hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

572
00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:29.940
<v Speaker 4>they're in a holiday inn somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they tried to split them all up and,</v>

573
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also there's a can immediate lag.</v>

574
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:34.640
<v Speaker 4>There isn't no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they don't know that.</v>

575
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 4>They can't get away with that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the days of social media.</v>

576
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.570
<v Speaker 4>They don't know that they can have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>council meeting.</v>

577
00:26:39.571 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 4>There isn't film the all because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got a camera now,</v>

578
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

579
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two things and I think,</v>

580
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 4>which is like social media for which </v>
<v Speaker 4>alone for a long time is seem to be like</v>

581
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:53.010
<v Speaker 4>quick can it depressing seesaw of good </v>
<v Speaker 4>and bad.</v>

582
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 4>I seems to be like a net gain in protest</v>
<v Speaker 4>movements.</v>

583
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.401
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

584
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:04.401
<v Speaker 4>and just also the fact that we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really in classes or are way more out of</v>

585
00:27:05.571 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 4>touch than we'd imagined.</v>

586
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

587
00:27:08.261 --> 00:27:09.094
<v Speaker 3>So they sit in a way is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it s a revelationary symbol of joy </v>

588
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.930
<v Speaker 3>that that brings together numerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fred's this connection,</v>

589
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:17.883
<v Speaker 3>total lack of concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the unawareness in fact of how </v>

590
00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 3>quickly things get changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fought,</v>

591
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that was notable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

592
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.103
<v Speaker 3>struck me was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the black sort of a Monday or </v>

593
00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:29.374
<v Speaker 3>whenever our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the fire Jeremy Corbyn was on tv </v>

594
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.743
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.953
<v Speaker 3>repossess ours is give them luxury flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that would have been a couple of </v>

596
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.070
<v Speaker 3>years ago that would be mental and </v>
<v Speaker 3>visible.</v>

597
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.720
<v Speaker 3>And then by Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday,</v>

598
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.590
<v Speaker 3>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is it almost that there is a,</v>

599
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.890
<v Speaker 3>there is a necessity to respond to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different kind of uh,</v>

600
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.023
<v Speaker 4>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also just like how it's almost </v>

601
00:27:52.191 --> 00:27:53.024
<v Speaker 4>novelistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's how can have cartoonish and </v>

602
00:27:54.801 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing has been so at the head </v>
<v Speaker 4>of housing,</v>

603
00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.040
<v Speaker 4>m Kensington and Chelsea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

604
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.080
<v Speaker 4>council is a guy called rock fielding </v>
<v Speaker 4>mail and it's going to stay down.</v>

605
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.333
<v Speaker 4>But he's like part of this like honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cratic family who his mother is some </v>

606
00:28:09.711 --> 00:28:10.544
<v Speaker 4>kind of modeled happy who ran a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of times and for this party called tree </v>

607
00:28:15.561 --> 00:28:16.394
<v Speaker 4>panning for the national health and try </v>
<v Speaker 4>and persuade everyone to like tree pine </v>

608
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:20.864
<v Speaker 4>themselves to drill a hole over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The drill to hell in a hand to help you </v>

609
00:28:23.691 --> 00:28:24.980
<v Speaker 4>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

610
00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:27.770
<v Speaker 4>So she's good taste sons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is rock fielding melon.</v>

611
00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:31.550
<v Speaker 4>The can a straight Arrow and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's cause cause it,</v>

612
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.413
<v Speaker 4>cosmo fielding malins done several </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentaries about acids and they live </v>

613
00:28:37.401 --> 00:28:39.920
<v Speaker 4>in this like Jacobean Mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

614
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.450
<v Speaker 4>And it has the Breton or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world's largest gravity phone,</v>

615
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.293
<v Speaker 4>tim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it has literally this enormous 300 </v>

616
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:52.811
<v Speaker 4>feet high powerful jet of water shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>up like 24 hours a day.</v>

617
00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:53.744
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinguished is in the grains of has an </v>

618
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.363
<v Speaker 4>ancestral home.</v>

619
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.610
<v Speaker 3>If only there was some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some way to control the confrontation,</v>

620
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:03.563
<v Speaker 3>one eyed man would've needed something </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd like a gravity defying press </v>

621
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.640
<v Speaker 3>conference over the solution was laying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in their garden.</v>

622
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.713
<v Speaker 3>And the the straight Arrow is the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's called rock melon rock fielding </v>

623
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Mellon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

624
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

625
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.503
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting when you talked before </v>

626
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:23.880
<v Speaker 3>about like perhaps materialism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>commodification being some extraordinary</v>

627
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 3>metaphor for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that we are spirit trapped</v>

628
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:28.344
<v Speaker 3>in matter because more and more I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing a kind of dumb poetry in current </v>

629
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:33.384
<v Speaker 3>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so if we're emblems such as the </v>

630
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:35.784
<v Speaker 3>tower itself and then sort of Ludicrous </v>
<v Speaker 3>sub narratives about fountain is in the </v>

631
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 3>garden as if somehow now the is </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearing</v>

632
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>just beneath the veneer of superficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

633
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.350
<v Speaker 2>But something ulterior is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize itself,</v>

634
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.380
<v Speaker 2>some dreadful beasts slouching towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bethlehem to be born,</v>

635
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.040
<v Speaker 2>but that is there some optimism in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky in,</v>

636
00:29:59.041 --> 00:29:59.874
<v Speaker 2>in events like this on a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know frankly this deep into the </v>

637
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on a practical level,</v>

638
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 2>do you think that this could precipitate</v>
<v Speaker 2>change?</v>

639
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.823
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's loads of things to be </v>

640
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:10.324
<v Speaker 2>positive about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the incompetence of your </v>

641
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at like the tardy carbonate,</v>

642
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.663
<v Speaker 2>like something make or fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can of living side I sent out to just </v>

643
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:25.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of saw cup shrapnel or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just,</v>

644
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tied onto a bus and driven at the media.</v>

645
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.730
<v Speaker 2>May Cook Golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

646
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 2>borders is like there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're just,</v>

647
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 2>they're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do we,</v>

648
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:41.250
<v Speaker 2>can we replace this in competent cunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a massive cunt?</v>

649
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And all we can do is I can see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's cause for optimism there.</v>

650
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.930
<v Speaker 2>What about you on a personal level?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has it been you,</v>

651
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:51.764
<v Speaker 2>you all right it happy in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got love in your life and </v>

652
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.920
<v Speaker 2>children and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

653
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.033
<v Speaker 2>I've got children I've been doing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>London doing this TV show on BBC two so </v>

654
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:02.044
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm messing my kids at the moment and </v>

655
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:08.770
<v Speaker 2>feeling about like how much longer can I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this?</v>

656
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 2>How long have you had to do so far I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been here for like months.</v>

657
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

658
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit disconnected.</v>

659
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it just makes,</v>

660
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes you write in a bit kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of automatic cars instead of like,</v>

661
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I really want to say something about </v>

662
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:24.110
<v Speaker 2>the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of going to,</v>

663
00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:24.944
<v Speaker 2>I need 10 jokes for this week to try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get through this thing and get back </v>

664
00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:28.924
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

665
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.663
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it breaks your relationship or </v>

666
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking be grand for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the idea of the mute.</v>

667
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.480
<v Speaker 2>My life has changed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

668
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 2>like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like when before I would just the</v>

669
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 2>philandering womanizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of professional,</v>

670
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:47.080
<v Speaker 2>loose cannon person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was sort of no consequence.</v>

671
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 2>There was a kind of delicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>rootlessness accompany though.</v>

672
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Speaker 2>It was with a deep sense of personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>despair.</v>

673
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.393
<v Speaker 2>Over the intervening when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hotel I was in would immediately turn </v>

674
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.444
<v Speaker 2>into sort of a barren multistory car </v>
<v Speaker 2>park bereft of all life bereft of all </v>

675
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.054
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just the trail of underwear </v>

676
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.610
<v Speaker 2>traipsing out of the door now like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

677
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.453
<v Speaker 2>this era is over and I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people I have peace and harmony </v>

678
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:17.280
<v Speaker 2>and love and all these things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of never like in it.</v>

679
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family was a kind of,</v>

680
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:19.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea that was nervous about because </v>

681
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:21.964
<v Speaker 2>of what the connotations that word had </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the one that I've grown up </v>

682
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.231
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:30.160
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm learning a kind of a new way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of living and one.</v>

684
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:30.994
<v Speaker 2>How'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd you feel to them and does that </v>

685
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 2>take you away from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like when I,</v>

686
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 2>if I go like I'm doing like touring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an intelligent way,</v>

687
00:32:38.501 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like so free shows a week</v>

688
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 3>and like if I have to stay away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend and my baby and my dog,</v>

689
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.913
<v Speaker 3>all of us go up in a car like traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People might as well have a banjo like </v>

690
00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 3>we were sort of like yeah it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good way of doing it because the center,</v>

691
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 3>the nucleus of my life has moved from </v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of limitless.</v>

692
00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.373
<v Speaker 3>We sort of like driven kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance ego goal or they was upset </v>

693
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.393
<v Speaker 3>to you already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That in itself has been in a woven with </v>

694
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 3>other stuff to oh no I have a home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a person.</v>

695
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a</v>

696
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.903
<v Speaker 4>great if you can do that man cause I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>just had to stop to them cause I did a </v>

697
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:16.580
<v Speaker 4>50 date to it or something last time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't handle it.</v>

698
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 4>It's too much</v>

699
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 3>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were away a lot.</v>

700
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.143
<v Speaker 3>And what happened to you</v>

701
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.240
<v Speaker 4>as she used to weigh too much and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also like you know the thing you</v>

702
00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:23.074
<v Speaker 4>get at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of criticism of comedians </v>

703
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:25.204
<v Speaker 4>about Oh you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want comedy to be a protected space </v>

704
00:33:27.521 --> 00:33:30.040
<v Speaker 4>and a special place where you can see </v>
<v Speaker 4>nsn and use.</v>

705
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this space away from that in the world.</v>

706
00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I could just stop them fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling or trying to claim on this stage</v>

707
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.930
<v Speaker 4>are lik explosive sales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

708
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.313
<v Speaker 4>do you know the idea that we have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspirational idea of it's a protected </v>

709
00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:46.660
<v Speaker 4>space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

710
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.920
<v Speaker 4>just cause you need to think that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're writing but in practice,</v>

711
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up on afraid and I in Blackburn</v>

712
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.940
<v Speaker 4>to people who've been drinking him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he stopped drinking it like fucking five</v>

713
00:33:57.941 --> 00:34:01.510
<v Speaker 4>o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh you and your protected space.</v>

714
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

715
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.793
<v Speaker 3>And that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside from that you find it personally </v>

716
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.910
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

717
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.330
<v Speaker 4>D M yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just find it really hard being away from</v>

718
00:34:12.331 --> 00:34:15.360
<v Speaker 4>home for the amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

719
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean I like the [inaudible] tif didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up so you write a joke,</v>

720
00:34:18.691 --> 00:34:20.760
<v Speaker 4>he'd go and try it works is in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shore.</v>

721
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:25.140
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of then taking that shore </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like a hundred times,</v>

722
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean as it gets less relevant to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in them.</v>

723
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.480
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm never doing it again,</v>

724
00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:31.314
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

725
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.173
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

726
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.780
<v Speaker 3>He didn't think could do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

727
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.570
<v Speaker 3>My technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's all right.</v>

728
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:36.880
<v Speaker 3>This is three days a week thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was here.</v>

729
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:37.963
<v Speaker 3>I see how it goes now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read both of your biographical books </v>

730
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 3>or other thing your brother said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

731
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.770
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to be worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

732
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Even when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

733
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 3>always be worried about something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're worried about something.</v>

734
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:51.320
<v Speaker 3>And even if that thing goes okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a new worry.</v>

735
00:34:51.321 --> 00:34:53.310
<v Speaker 3>So basically you're always do white </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some things.</v>

736
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that thought very much and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had it myself.</v>

737
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A hierarchy of like what is that we have</v>

738
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 4>and all we ever really was replace the </v>
<v Speaker 4>one at the top.</v>

739
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

740
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.511
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

741
00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:05.344
<v Speaker 3>This is jostling league table of angst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have some kind of like have you </v>

742
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.070
<v Speaker 3>do think that that sort of dynamic of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you already life,</v>

743
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:13.690
<v Speaker 3>which seems to have pretty fraught to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

744
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.613
<v Speaker 3>So it sounded like it's quite difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>and obviously you were an alcoholic for </v>

745
00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.450
<v Speaker 3>a while or is it the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

746
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.353
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this of pop popular style </v>

747
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the condition will </v>
<v Speaker 3>remain one like that.</v>

748
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't drink no more tech drugs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind.</v>

749
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do anything.</v>

750
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.011
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>program or something?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

757
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.233
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get obsessive about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just do too much or it did more </v>

758
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:43.380
<v Speaker 2>than makes me happy.</v>

759

<v Speaker 4>it did so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might not be that's,</v>

763
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.000
<v Speaker 4>that's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's supposed to be.</v>

764
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

765
00:35:54.851 --> 00:35:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how you got lack of vision</v>

766
00:35:58.901 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 2>for what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in activism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see yourself ever wanting to be </v>

769
00:36:08.171 --> 00:36:09.004
<v Speaker 2>in a position of any authority or power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that idea sort of soup simply be </v>

770
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.323
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant here?</v>

771
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems incredibly unpleasant.</v>

772
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've heard that thing?</v>

773
00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the once and future king t h wait,</v>

774

<v Speaker 4>but king asa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

776
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.930
<v Speaker 4>it seemed as a 12 year olds or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

777
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:24.764
<v Speaker 4>That's where they took him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sod and this door and Cuttin from </v>

778
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:27.834
<v Speaker 4>and kind of where they took monty python</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the holy grail they expect from it </v>

779
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's all access.</v>

780
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.530
<v Speaker 4>There's fairly jolly can a kid's book </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cubo Eh,</v>

781
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young arts and meet Marilyn and they,</v>

<v Speaker 4>all that kind of stuff.</v>

784
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.193
<v Speaker 4>And then a few chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we start to get bit darker in </v>

785
00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tons.</v>

786
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm into fashion consumer lives lake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fashion,</v>

787
00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:48.404
<v Speaker 4>he swims around in the mall and he meets</v>
<v Speaker 4>this peak and the peak does this speech </v>

788
00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:53.174
<v Speaker 4>about power and it goes like a love is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just an evolutionary track and their </v>

789
00:36:57.771 --> 00:36:59.860
<v Speaker 4>pleasures the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the rides,</v>

<v Speaker 4>12 or something.</v>

792
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.113
<v Speaker 4>But it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the assessment that's </v>

793
00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:12.710
<v Speaker 4>going on and people that want power of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wellness is all their ads control.</v>

00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 4>you don't even like me do you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or something like that.</v>

805
00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:39.024
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bed.</v>

806
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.043
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he to step in front of the bill it for </v>

807
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:42.840
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

808
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:43.943
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

809
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.410
<v Speaker 2>He was just like this what it is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little cat.</v>

810
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:47.244
<v Speaker 2>He's maybe three or four at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you try and explain that or impact </v>

811
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim is very difficult.</v>

812
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.460
<v Speaker 2>We're really didn't have an intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of that.</v>

813
00:37:54.461 --> 00:37:57.280
<v Speaker 2>You think of overwhelming love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they do.</v>

814
00:37:57.281 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think Ted's are quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

815
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.530
<v Speaker 2>it depends on your bra I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But selfish little bastards didn't know.</v>

816
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Like this one I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only seven months old.</v>

817
00:38:05.501 --> 00:38:08.260
<v Speaker 2>At least just I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm diluting it will.</v>

818
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:10.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

820
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have that.</v>

821
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>They're really centered on themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first few years aren't there and</v>

822
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:18.370
<v Speaker 2>then that's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would kill me for amusement.</v>

823
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.373
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's glorious and so beautiful </v>

824
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:31.471
<v Speaker 2>and it's caused me to plumb new fathoms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of love within myself.</v>

825
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.180
<v Speaker 2>But in return I have received little </v>
<v Speaker 2>butt grabbed chest hair and</v>

826
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 3>hair,</v>

827
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 4>but I think the best thing in my life is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that important.</v>

828
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.414
<v Speaker 4>I'm uses my son the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is some misfortune be falling me in </v>

829
00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:46.170
<v Speaker 4>margin in me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated.</v>

830
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm stuck in some place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

831
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he finds funniest too.</v>

832
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Anytime anything bad happens I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

833
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I tell him this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's going to kill himself.</v>

834
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loves it.</v>

835
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:56.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

836
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.680
<v Speaker 3>He loves nothing more than to hear you </v>
<v Speaker 3>being trounced.</v>

837
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.100
<v Speaker 3>One of them things that you hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

838
00:39:02.101 --> 00:39:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said when he come in here that bloody</v>

839
00:39:03.831 --> 00:39:04.664
<v Speaker 3>Yanis Varoufakis he came in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us about the dynamics of path and </v>

840
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>

841
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:09.381
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>

842
00:39:09.381 --> 00:39:10.610
<v Speaker 3>they've got no power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were there,</v>

843
00:39:10.611 --> 00:39:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I've only got power within their </v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic role.</v>

844
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Like even somebody said like wolf gang </v>
<v Speaker 3>shall by the German chancellor.</v>

845
00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 3>He said out loud to that Yanis </v>
<v Speaker 3>Varoufakis democracies.</v>

846
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you don't change anything.</v>

847
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.210
<v Speaker 3>And he was not ever being ironic nor </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismissive or anything.</v>

848
00:39:23.211 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 3>He just was state in some data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democracies are right.</v>

849
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.930
<v Speaker 3>As long as it doesn't change anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

850
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.400
<v Speaker 3>that he within like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

851
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.880
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of like you answer a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said from his flirtation,</v>

852
00:39:31.881 --> 00:39:33.740
<v Speaker 3>we've actual power structures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were in,</v>

853
00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:35.990
<v Speaker 3>it would just inhabit in particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>roles.</v>

854
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.360
<v Speaker 3>And these were these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew that.</v>

855
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

856
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we make the mistake sometimes of</v>

857
00:39:40.431 --> 00:39:42.560
<v Speaker 4>going on from that obviously knows a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than me,</v>

858
00:39:42.561 --> 00:39:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but I think I sometimes think we made </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mistake of going on.</v>

859
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.810
<v Speaker 4>So the real power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's somewhere else.</v>

860
00:39:47.811 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 4>The real powers that Ross child's or </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever,</v>

861
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.530
<v Speaker 4>and the real power is the system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

862
00:39:51.531 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 4>the real parents systemic is within the </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions,</v>

863
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.760
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

864
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

865
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.440
<v Speaker 3>so you mean it is not a human power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of superhuman or on the human?</v>

866
00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

867
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like corporations,</v>

868
00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:03.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that idea of,</v>

869
00:40:03.541 --> 00:40:04.374
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make corporations liable </v>

870
00:40:05.521 --> 00:40:08.160
<v Speaker 4>for things you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a blueprints for making money.</v>

871
00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:10.350
<v Speaker 4>You need to look at ways of reducing </v>
<v Speaker 4>their power,</v>

872
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.670
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

873
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.503
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is actually one of the things that </v>

874
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.020
<v Speaker 3>has come up from talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let you know these,</v>

875
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.093
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the s and the Yanis Varoufakis and name </v>

876
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.870
<v Speaker 3>and now yourself is that as long as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there,</v>

877
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.560
<v Speaker 3>as long as they are our hubs of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>centralized power,</v>

878
00:40:25.561 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 3>it's always going to behave according to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the motif of that pipe.</v>

879
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.040
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to perpetuate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustain itself.</v>

880
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.100
<v Speaker 3>So the only way of changing it is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismantle it even like it.</v>

881
00:40:37.861 --> 00:40:40.860
<v Speaker 3>So I do think that in like on a personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

882
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.343
<v Speaker 3>are you willing to make big sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the Andy and do you think </v>

883
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:46.380
<v Speaker 3>that people genuinely generally are?</v>

884
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I need to.</v>

885
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

886
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.900
<v Speaker 4>there's a kind of equal to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

887
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.743
<v Speaker 4>I like that whole thing of lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a documentary once to build that </v>

888
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 4>habit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edge general,</v>

889
00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:02.910
<v Speaker 4>all gays who pin on rocks and they see </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's really all,</v>

890
00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:04.190
<v Speaker 4>it might be a thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

891
00:41:04.191 --> 00:41:05.480
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just redo the eye,</v>

892
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.580
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this researcher was seen it,</v>

893
00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:09.170
<v Speaker 4>one of them I want you to not for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

894
00:41:09.171 --> 00:41:11.480
<v Speaker 4>let's say and I'm antique essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy's like,</v>

895
00:41:11.481 --> 00:41:14.690
<v Speaker 4>no we don't just part of the same gate </v>
<v Speaker 4>in hand that does this.</v>

896
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.810
<v Speaker 4>And I think if you think of yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I'm doing the eye,</v>

897
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.943
<v Speaker 4>it's much healthier for you than going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to create this thing that </v>

898
00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:23.450
<v Speaker 4>lasts for 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

899
00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a very wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very wise soul there sat there.</v>

900
00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that thing I was thinking about</v>

901
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:33.630
<v Speaker 3>everyday you might like here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's thinking about them Amanda?</v>

902
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Laws like in other people take ages and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages to manufacturer them,</v>

903
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

904
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:38.324
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sit there ages than they are </v>

905
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 3>with the sand and it's bull lake takes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>week and then they just sweep it up.</v>

906
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And like obviously like me as a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's likes permanence,</v>

907
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.410
<v Speaker 3>like oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

908
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was brilliant.</v>

909
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:48.134
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course the pop point of it is </v>

910
00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Dean Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feeling cause you can lose your own</v>

911
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:53.690
<v Speaker 3>body yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's gonna fall apart.</v>

912
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] kind old coat that poem you </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

913
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 3>But that even a thing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michelangelo's David,</v>

914
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:02.080
<v Speaker 3>it's just a temporary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment we'll come with,</v>

915
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:02.923
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whatever death cult looms up out of </v>

916
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

917
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:06.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>

918
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 3>if the right demographic becomes poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

919
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.763
<v Speaker 3>if they rise up against idolatry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chisel in hand to decide to smash away </v>

920
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 3>the renaissance in the Isis inspired </v>
<v Speaker 3>frenzy.</v>

921
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.893
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Michelangelo's David is on its </v>

922
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:20.204
<v Speaker 3>way to destruction and deterioration as </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of our individual bodies are on </v>

923
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:23.744
<v Speaker 3>their way to destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deterioration and this sort of sense of </v>

924
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Speaker 3>oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea that this aboriginal aborigine</v>

925
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.520
<v Speaker 3>exhibit eight in our bad just duty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

926
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:33.000
<v Speaker 3>that's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no revere.</v>

927
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:33.843
<v Speaker 3>The deer on the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that that is a better type of </v>

928
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

929
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.173
<v Speaker 3>but that idea of a sort of an an it did </v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous connection beyond our </v>

930
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:44.360
<v Speaker 3>individual understanding of time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

931
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's bloody hard to get that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't,</v>

932
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:46.731
<v Speaker 3>it may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

933
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.000
<v Speaker 3>but that's not how people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the world.</v>

934
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is incredibly hard.</v>

935
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I think there's always that thing where </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was quite interested in this idea</v>

936
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:55.334
<v Speaker 4>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Culture is like every resistance to </v>

937
00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:00.800
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever had that?</v>

938
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like this isn't my idea,</v>

939
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:04.634
<v Speaker 4>but it's like the idea is that what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>call coach for now is kind of comes up </v>

940
00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:12.720
<v Speaker 4>in the time of like Fredric [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Germany and it's sort of for,</v>

941
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.573
<v Speaker 4>for what became Germany and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>to resist the French idea of several </v>

942
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 4>eyes and through institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

943
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:22.250
<v Speaker 4>France has all these different academies</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the arts and so on.</v>

944
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.084
<v Speaker 4>And that partly that was a kind of soft </v>
<v Speaker 4>power way of making everything very </v>

945
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:26.954
<v Speaker 4>French,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

946
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 4>and culture can arise is up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and I kind of think we're in</v>

947
00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:31.754
<v Speaker 4>a kind of late stage in that know where </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of our problem is we work within </v>

948
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 4>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try and produce culture.</v>

949
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 4>So the reason it's difficult to do a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand show on the BBC is that the comedy</v>

950
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 4>clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason comedy clubs exist is</v>

951
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:48.010
<v Speaker 4>to resist things like the BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr,</v>

952
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.681
<v Speaker 4>go on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that?</v>

953
00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Fucking sure you know that part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's part of the reason for them,</v>

954
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.510
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

955
00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.330
<v Speaker 4>so where do you go from there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

956
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 4>do you democratize institutions or do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you try and dry the clothes institutions</v>

957
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:04.100
<v Speaker 4>in some way or make them more </v>
<v Speaker 4>representative or something?</v>

958
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.170
<v Speaker 4>But it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

959
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.200
<v Speaker 4>we'd all stuck in some sense within </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions that are kind of Pristina's</v>

960
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.160
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As oppose.</v>

961
00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:18.180
<v Speaker 3>So a ref to refer back to that idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

962
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:21.750
<v Speaker 3>we have ourselves become </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized.</v>

963
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Who is thinking our thought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is prescribing the stories?</v>

964
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:30.120
<v Speaker 3>What is it that I'm thinking of when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of myself?</v>

965
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the things in our email </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondence you talked about was,</v>

966
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:35.683
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the correct words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you talked about the idea of </v>

967
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 3>language being a sort of an effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent of virus in the mind.</v>

968
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Talk me through that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

969
00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.140
<v Speaker 4>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's my idea.</v>

970
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.480
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is like Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

971
00:44:46.481 --> 00:44:47.314
<v Speaker 4>you know what kit toxoplasmosis is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease that cats or catch it gives to </v>

972
00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:56.290
<v Speaker 4>mace and it clears tiny little scars in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and may spins,</v>

973
00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that never heal the,</v>

974
00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:01.330
<v Speaker 4>makes them nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behave in an uninhibited way.</v>

975
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 4>So Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're on inhabited,</v>

976
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.980
<v Speaker 4>they're more likely to be caught by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

977
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like toxoplasmosis has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podocyte seat.</v>

978
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Brainpower piracy performs a function of</v>
<v Speaker 4>changing behavior to mace.</v>

979
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.490
<v Speaker 4>What if language is that for humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what if language has been seated here</v>

980
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.743
<v Speaker 4>to make us behave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe just behave loader so that we can </v>

981
00:45:23.651 --> 00:45:24.484
<v Speaker 4>be phoned and consumed by some cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 4>entity or maybe it's simply something </v>

982
00:45:29.261 --> 00:45:31.420
<v Speaker 4>that's watch and it makes us more </v>
<v Speaker 4>amusing.</v>

983
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.490
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we're able to relate </v>
<v Speaker 4>through language.</v>

984
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Is it really</v>

985
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.803
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and extraordinary idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the point of origin that cat </v>

986
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.190
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cavalier mice,</v>

987
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.630
<v Speaker 3>but they go fucking the shit that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>my submit.</v>

988
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Cocksure buccaneer yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the live fast die young mice population.</v>

989
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.470
<v Speaker 3>And you think that language could is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really sort of a quiet,</v>

990
00:45:53.471 --> 00:45:54.710
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautifully complex idea.</v>

991
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.390
<v Speaker 3>This isn't an occupying force because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it manifesting all his metaphor,</v>

992
00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.300
<v Speaker 3>all this symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is being expressed?</v>

993
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it,</v>

994
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:04.423
<v Speaker 3>it denies the supposition that language </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a reference to some deeper essential </v>

995
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 3>self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

996
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:10.783
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

997
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.300
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's own vessel made a minute done.</v>

998
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 3>If we get into trouble with trump's skin</v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistics anywhere along the way.</v>

999
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 4>I think Chomsky be on our side on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing turns Mckenna and bill for it.</v>

1001
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna and nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great pioneers of DMT and Iowaska.</v>

1002
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:26.840
<v Speaker 3>That'd be well up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But chompsky I mean he's a,</v>

1003
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.773
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems quite dour at the best of the </v>

1004
00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I like,</v>

1005
00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:31.314
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1006
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Well Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankie,</v>

1007
00:46:33.511 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's of plausible </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1008
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the ice suck,</v>

1009
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.500
<v Speaker 3>you suck my life out at deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1010

<v Speaker 3>What was my other thing there?</v>

1011
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is interesting.</v>

1012
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 3>I think he might bring me to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>precipice of my awareness.</v>

1013
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:48.474
<v Speaker 3>So think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I never lose the tendrils and </v>

1014
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 3>threads that are required.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1015
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Iowaska and DMT Doni above you as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person in sobriety and recovery,</v>

1016
00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:58.763

<v Speaker 3>lifestyle edge that you can't take our </v>

1017
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 3>WESCO cause like you referenced Terence </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna there that grow cosmonaut of the</v>

1018
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I listened to those.</v>

1019
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:09.563
<v Speaker 3>I watch youtube seems to borderline </v>
<v Speaker 3>fetishistic Stickley of people talking </v>

1020
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:13.884
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like the describing their </v>

1021
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:18.540
<v Speaker 3>journeys on dmt and DMT even more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ios guy because you smoke in,</v>

1022
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.930
<v Speaker 3>it's such an obvious black crack as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogen,</v>

1023
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1026
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:27.804
<v Speaker 3>reasons of research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I find myself with a pipe in my hand </v>

1027
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.540

1029
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:36.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these metaphors made literal?</v>

1030
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated if you've ever read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking open the head Daniel Pinchbeck.</v>

1031

<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1035
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.180
<v Speaker 2>He did other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we experimented with drugs and he's</v>

1036
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.470
<v Speaker 2>a really good book.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dimensional traveler scarf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good job.</v>

1042
00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I took all these drugs actually cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've discovered up quick.</v>

1043
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a cot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oldest a separate thing.</v>

1044
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.520
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that was the drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't quite the court took the drugs</v>

1045
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.300
<v Speaker 3>There's the drive sometime self in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical using drugs.</v>

1047
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.333
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like this for me there's something </v>

1048
00:48:21.451 --> 00:48:25.260
<v Speaker 3>beautiful about this mystery in the it </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have archetypal experiences.</v>

1049
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Well I find that exciting when it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That terence Mckenna stuff,</v>

1050
00:48:27.661 --> 00:48:28.494
<v Speaker 3>he's holding a minute people to drop in </v>
<v Speaker 3>its acid and their flood plot of </v>

1051
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.063
<v Speaker 3>plunging inward into inner myths and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truths and this syntheses is that the </v>

1052
00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:36.474
<v Speaker 3>word we'd like different sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's representing themselves in sort of </v>

1053
00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:42.480
<v Speaker 3>different media like you're able to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>visually the zeitgeists trends.</v>

1054
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.523
<v Speaker 3>For me that's a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that image matrix suggest to me that my </v>

1055
00:48:47.851 --> 00:48:52.500
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness is such a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>aperture of a total consciousness.</v>

1056
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.190
<v Speaker 3>It makes me start remembering my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences and I said,</v>

1057
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.280
<v Speaker 3>and it makes you want to do it more.</v>

1058
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:59.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something to be said for that </v>

1059
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.310
<v Speaker 2>wipeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get older,</v>

1060
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:02.540
<v Speaker 2>we won't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1061
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:06.320
<v Speaker 2>because we like as the material form </v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrate,</v>

1062
00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.920
<v Speaker 2>you'll stuffing out of might as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like dive within,</v>

1063
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.750
<v Speaker 2>let it fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew this girl,</v>

1064
00:49:11.751 --> 00:49:12.584
<v Speaker 2>he was on acid every day for a year as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>waitress and she was obviously having a </v>

1065
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.690
<v Speaker 2>bad time and eventually she said to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people running the restaurant,</v>

1066
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.913
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on like a heavy dose of acid </v>

1067
00:49:23.121 --> 00:49:23.954
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

1068
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:24.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave.</v>

1069
00:49:24.891 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go get therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1070
00:49:25.931 --> 00:49:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't leave.</v>

1071
00:49:27.021 --> 00:49:27.854
<v Speaker 2>You're like the best.</v>

1072
00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:30.623
<v Speaker 3>Come on just for your brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us more about that winged serpent </v>

1073
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:35.170
<v Speaker 3>thing that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1074
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.080
<v Speaker 3>lots of it didn't affect her job as well</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like acid,</v>

1075
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:38.914
<v Speaker 3>like the first time I sort of heard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like people at school with them </v>

1076
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 3>in it and how can you do score and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1077
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.270
<v Speaker 3>cause I didn't take it to a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1078
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I was like 18 first time I took it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forgot you can't do this and school like</v>

1079
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:50.543
<v Speaker 3>oh but everything just completely shut </v>
<v Speaker 3>down my whole reality shutdown of love </v>

1080
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:55.084
<v Speaker 3>because my sense of self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that like in my 18 year old </v>

1081
00:49:58.091 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what reality was </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing oh no,</v>

1082
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.853
<v Speaker 3>there is no such thing as self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a composite of biography </v>

1083
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:07.683
<v Speaker 3>and biochemical data and it probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have known where it's like </v>

1084
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Speaker 3>biochemical data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember feeling that.</v>

1085
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I remember looking at my own anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allah,</v>

1086
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you and Hitler not done saying good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing like I,</v>

1087
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking these hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this occupant force?</v>

1088
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.930
<v Speaker 3>What is this energy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not my thinking but is,</v>

1089
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:23.764
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is my consciousness and my anatomical </v>

1090
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:26.044
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there seems me that there is some </v>

1091
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:31.050
<v Speaker 3>truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some truth in being able to uh,</v>

1092
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.963
<v Speaker 3>add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend my conventional ideas of self </v>

1093
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.060
<v Speaker 3>and like that sometimes a material life </v>
<v Speaker 3>with its prescription.</v>

1094
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I don't feel wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moms are transcendent love,</v>

1095
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 3>such as with my little kid and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide the l May,</v>

1096
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I just went on a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drove that day for 24 hours and a fought</v>

1097
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.900
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life can be so different.</v>

1098
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man on a barge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I can work.</v>

1099
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:50.234
<v Speaker 3>The bar's probably so I have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out and why he didn't through </v>

1100
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:52.450
<v Speaker 3>shallow waters.</v>

1101
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.283
<v Speaker 3>You're not mean it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed like such a renunciation </v>

1102
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.403
<v Speaker 3>of ordinariness for me to be this bloke </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a boat with a family as much as it </v>

1103
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.304
<v Speaker 3>was to be a dad in a loft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting the crib up there when a baby </v>

1104
00:51:02.721 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 3>got too big for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at that dinner loft.</v>

1105
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm at that dinner loft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a man on the board.</v>

1106
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 3>There was blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Indian now go to normally around the</v>

1107
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:09.014
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've called up and got Indian from the </v>

1108
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:10.620
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always get it.</v>

1109
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Life hadn't changed that Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

1110
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:13.034
<v Speaker 3>we weren't dances with bloody wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just made me realize this life </v>

1111
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not it.</v>

1112
00:51:18.051 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 3>This is a selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a confection.</v>

1113
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:25.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm the curator of this reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like a promethium and trapped in</v>

1114
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 3>a sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll call moment.</v>

1115
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.704
<v Speaker 3>I kind of any moment abandoned all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember once you have a girlfriend </v>

1116
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:31.041
<v Speaker 3>going to like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of this shit for you.</v>

1148
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.613
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he met biohacks when he was blake </v>

<v Speaker 4>really young guy and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he pastored bell hacks for his advice </v>

1151
00:52:56.761 --> 00:52:59.640
<v Speaker 4>over a couple of nights and biohacks hex</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1159
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.390
<v Speaker 4>kind of a bike that is realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are not the be all and end all.</v>

1160
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.443
<v Speaker 4>There's the next generation along from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and the next generation along for </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1163
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 4>stuff on this stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it powerful?</v>

1164
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 4>Is Transcendent id just so together the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aboriginal,</v>

1165
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I have a beautiful Bill Hicks story and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if punctured,</v>

1166
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 4>just for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my narcissism,</v>

1167
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:38.100
<v Speaker 4>but hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get it back.</v>

1168
00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute and it must be some reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>why I'm important.</v>

1169
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 4>The eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>MTV awards was married that time.</v>

1170
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it,</v>

1171
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:46.820
<v Speaker 4>but have you ever lesson they join it.</v>

1172
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:48.690
<v Speaker 4>John Lennon talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1173
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:49.923
<v Speaker 4>Lennon tastes like thousands of trips </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say he's like eventually Lizard </v>

1174
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 4>Cortana and talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says like he eventually just realizes</v>

1175
00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:57.564
<v Speaker 4>he's dissolved his whole legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't experience life as a can a </v>

1176
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 4>narcissist anymore and he can't rate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some friend comes to visit him.</v>

1177
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Speaker 4>I guess someone from England and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Luke.</v>

1178
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Remember that time that you wrote that </v>
<v Speaker 4>song?</v>

1179
00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:11.950
<v Speaker 4>You mean take then that was in like all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1180
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.893
<v Speaker 4>all the different staff that is ego has </v>
<v Speaker 4>helped him to do and Lennon of </v>

1181
00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:16.864
<v Speaker 4>eventually arrives at the point before </v>
<v Speaker 4>he has just come back of going do need </v>

1182
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 4>some ego to get stuff done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just</v>

1183
00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:24.603
<v Speaker 3>well in Nail Bhagavad Gita,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty clear about this is you </v>

1184
00:54:27.901 --> 00:54:30.110
<v Speaker 3>are here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in the material world,</v>

1185
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:34.030
<v Speaker 3>but God's got nothing against material </v>
<v Speaker 3>we did not denounce material with.</v>

1186
00:54:34.031 --> 00:54:34.864
<v Speaker 3>They're not favor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute asceticism and totaled </v>

1187
00:54:36.581 --> 00:54:38.710
<v Speaker 3>announcement of this accenture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will experience it.</v>

1188
00:54:38.711 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a for luck joyousness in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hinduism that I robbery enjoy.</v>

1189
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:42.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Above the austerity or for some other </v>

1190
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.950
<v Speaker 3>faiths that I know equally lethal about </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like sort of,</v>

1191
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I like about that is the,</v>

1192
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.421
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1193
00:54:50.421 --> 00:54:51.254
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ego is an artifact that is not just </v>

1194
00:54:53.651 --> 00:54:58.651
<v Speaker 3>this sort of product of commodification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>commodification and capitalism by its,</v>

1195
00:54:59.291 --> 00:55:00.124
<v Speaker 3>it can be this glorious expression in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Bill Hicks way of their </v>

1196
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:04.750
<v Speaker 3>consciousness experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>limitless consciousness.</v>

1197
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.030
<v Speaker 3>The experience in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1198
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:11.470
<v Speaker 3>subjectively that it in a kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>an an aesthetic idea,</v>

1199
00:55:11.471 --> 00:55:13.120
<v Speaker 3>like a while to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1200
00:55:13.121 --> 00:55:15.790
<v Speaker 3>owner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearable work of art or be a work of art</v>

1201
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.890
<v Speaker 3>that we can become like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:55:17.891 --> 00:55:19.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needn't be,</v>

1203
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1204
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Now I think I'm going to actually vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm drunk high west Scott.</v>

1205
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Cause somehow just by virtue of talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

1206
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.490
<v Speaker 3>but that we can become the realization </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this beauty,</v>

1207
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:31.324
<v Speaker 3>this facet of the limitless that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole can be experienced in the </v>

1208
00:55:34.541 --> 00:55:36.010
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

1209
00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:36.963
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious at this thing goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genie's out of the bottle on </v>

1210
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:39.514
<v Speaker 3>individual ism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to tell people you're </v>

1211
00:55:40.421 --> 00:55:41.680
<v Speaker 3>part of the parish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on this,</v>

1212
00:55:41.681 --> 00:55:44.050
<v Speaker 3>get together and be a collective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's pot on a boiler suit.</v>

1213
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Shit's over.</v>

1214
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:47.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna want to be individuals,</v>

1215
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:48.483
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forever find myself banging on about </v>

1216
00:55:50.441 --> 00:55:53.920
<v Speaker 3>the importance of religion because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's the only way to transcend the</v>

1217
00:55:53.921 --> 00:55:54.754
<v Speaker 3>prohibitions and limitations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialism that you've got to somehow </v>

1218
00:55:57.850 --> 00:55:58.683
<v Speaker 3>engage the mythic imagination of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're right that it is a sort of a </v>

1219
00:56:02.441 --> 00:56:03.274
<v Speaker 3>form of propagandizing people and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>does require that you yourself believe </v>

1220
00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:07.870
<v Speaker 3>in the metaphor.</v>

1221
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:08.703
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess why I'm interested in </v>

1222
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:13.660
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogens and psychedelics because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a way of make the dream real.</v>

1223
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I heard this thing frankie about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1224
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.223
<v Speaker 3>like I think it's apocryphal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a nice little thing like I was </v>

1225
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.690
<v Speaker 3>that when the settlers came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the settlers,</v>

1226
00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 3>they shamed the hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies and most notably the Shaman,</v>

1227
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.023
<v Speaker 3>the shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said your rituals are bullshit and </v>

1228
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 3>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your dances,</v>

1229
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.930
<v Speaker 3>your spells and your silliness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1230
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 3>out on the edge of the village and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaman became clown,</v>

1231
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 3>lost the visa ability to be mythic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>potent.</v>

1232
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.743
<v Speaker 3>The Shaman becomes the clown earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>profane nothing but each jokes to guard </v>

1233
00:56:46.241 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 3>him against these new d as the settlers </v>
<v Speaker 3>drag him down.</v>

1234
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.913
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what we've become now the </v>

1235
00:56:52.071 --> 00:56:52.760
<v Speaker 3>shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1236
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.370
<v Speaker 4>I've often thought at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 4>every joke scandal,</v>

1237
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:58.290
<v Speaker 4>you can see why shamans left on the edge</v>
<v Speaker 4>of tone.</v>

1238
00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.513
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to make a quick getaway </v>

1239
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:01.703
<v Speaker 4>sometimes</v>

1240
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:07.070
<v Speaker 3>didn't like that one stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nailed mosques on that same thing.</v>

1241
00:57:08.251 --> 00:57:13.251
<v Speaker 3>My backpack and off I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello Wickham people,</v>

1242
00:57:14.641 --> 00:57:16.870
<v Speaker 3>you know that got feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1243
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 3>So like what do you feel when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the midst of some Brouhaha?</v>

1244
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if the things I most enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>about you is watching on line,</v>

1245
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:22.954
<v Speaker 3>how you beautifully articulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The scandal around where the joke you </v>

1246
00:57:30.401 --> 00:57:33.730
<v Speaker 3>made around about Harvey and Katie </v>
<v Speaker 3>Price.</v>

1247
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:34.564
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was such a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>rendering cause I would obviously from </v>

1248
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:38.500
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sort of a like a humanist,</v>

1249
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:39.334
<v Speaker 3>I suppose if you want to word </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective God k prize wouldn't class </v>

1250
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:44.740
<v Speaker 3>woman Harvey Meant Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

1251
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1252
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 3>but I obviously first and foremost it </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it,</v>

1253
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1254
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.690
<v Speaker 3>and secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1255
00:57:50.691 --> 00:57:51.524
<v Speaker 3>your analysis of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was quite beautiful whenever I've </v>

1256
00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:56.550
<v Speaker 3>been called upon to justify the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my Andrew Sachs saying,</v>

1257
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always got angry again.</v>

1258
00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I've always got angry because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even real.</v>

1259
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not even fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even offended.</v>

1260
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not this just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>collision of the BBC,</v>

1261
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 3>this mainstream media because they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1262
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:11.440
<v Speaker 3>like I've got an re engaged reenergized </v>
<v Speaker 3>by it.</v>

1263
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.670
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>justifying your own jokes,</v>

1264
00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:15.504
<v Speaker 3>scandal stuff?</v>

1265
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:16.873
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never tried to really justify </v>

1266
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.470
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1267
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I think sometimes like that thing you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>describing there,</v>

1268
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:22.874
<v Speaker 4>it's just that fact that you understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the center of something that is much </v>

1269
00:58:25.611 --> 00:58:29.810
<v Speaker 4>more complex than what has been boiled </v>
<v Speaker 4>down to in a tabloid.</v>

1270
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.411
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

1271
00:58:30.411 --> 00:58:31.244
<v Speaker 4>well that routine starts a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it goes a different place and when </v>

1272
00:58:34.491 --> 00:58:36.290
<v Speaker 4>the night is different every night and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1273
00:58:36.291 --> 00:58:36.711
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

1274
00:58:36.711 --> 00:58:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And why am I getting hoisted for this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So does that say to,</v>

1275
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:40.993
<v Speaker 4>but there's also the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like how many people have </v>

1276
00:58:44.841 --> 00:58:47.870
<v Speaker 4>really got a sense of humor for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>

1277
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:51.470
<v Speaker 4>So like if you look at like what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would call a of comedy,</v>

1278
00:58:51.471 --> 00:58:53.180
<v Speaker 4>we'd guess we'd see ourselves in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition,</v>

1279
00:58:53.181 --> 00:58:56.270
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we watched probably all the same comics,</v>

1280
00:58:56.271 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 4>like when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1281
00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:01.310
<v Speaker 4>the back was the biggest alternative </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

1282
00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.293
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like an hour over the period of our </v>

1283
00:59:04.551 --> 00:59:06.260
<v Speaker 4>careers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the office or something.</v>

1284
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.390
<v Speaker 4>So the office maybe got two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>million or something.</v>

1285
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:13.010
<v Speaker 4>3 million people and says maybe 60 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million viewers in Britain.</v>

1286
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.973
<v Speaker 4>She charitably you're thinking like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest desk can go is about 5% of the </v>

1287
00:59:17.871 --> 00:59:20.870
<v Speaker 4>population is going to be untethered to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get more than that.</v>

1288
00:59:20.871 --> 00:59:23.100
<v Speaker 4>You've much caught to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on and a dress.</v>

1289
00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So most people aren't into this.</v>

1290
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of the problem is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been asked to justify jokes,</v>

1291
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 4>which is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not to people who don't particularly</v>

1292
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 4>like or even understand like what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

1293
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a huge part of it.</v>

1294
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Is there the papers in particular author</v>
<v Speaker 4>by relocation,</v>

1295
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 4>they're taking something that you said </v>
<v Speaker 4>to one audience so that you said at nine</v>

1296
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:50.654
<v Speaker 4>o'clock on a Friday night in Newcastle </v>
<v Speaker 4>and showing it to people over their </v>

1297
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:55.140
<v Speaker 4>breakfast and their home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>county and Gomez,</v>

1298
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 4>that's acceptable for them.</v>

1299
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CSS.</v>

1300
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.483
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that re contextualization is such a </v>

1301
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:04.304
<v Speaker 3>vital and neglected component and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always found it also annoying is </v>

1302
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:13.241
<v Speaker 3>the disingenuity of the papers when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the repositioning of like that.</v>

1303
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that they are ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said what?</v>

1304
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1305
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can to have to</v>

1306
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 4>journalist of all people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who let,</v>

1307
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Shirley goes through other people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Ben.</v>

1308
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.333
<v Speaker 4>They sitting there like horrified that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's dressed up as the twin towers </v>

1309
01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:31.360
<v Speaker 4>at Halloween or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1310
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>us to people who feel any shock.</v>

1311
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I had one that was like I did a joint is</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1312
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.353
<v Speaker 4>The guy who did the speaking clock died </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I did something to call them or </v>

1313
01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:45.000
<v Speaker 4>something that said hopefully died </v>
<v Speaker 4>after,</v>

1314
01:00:45.001 --> 01:00:45.834
<v Speaker 4>sees a small strokes and I got an email </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the journalists or the Daily </v>

1315
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.573
<v Speaker 4>Telegraph who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well actually miss through whatever his </v>

1316
01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:53.884
<v Speaker 4>name is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead die from a series of small strokes </v>

1317
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:56.703
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a bit to foreign his family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh if you can make him ask him if he'd </v>

1318
01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:02.820
<v Speaker 4>find your joy commuters and is there </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything you'd like times can just don't</v>

1319
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.230
<v Speaker 4>the money fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's you joke,</v>

1320
01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you telling them that joke they'd never </v>
<v Speaker 4>have hair day.</v>

1321
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.933
<v Speaker 4>If someone projects upon movie on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>side of a primary school that police </v>

1322
01:01:12.161 --> 01:01:13.680
<v Speaker 4>don't erase Ron Jeremy for</v>

1323
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 3>the old throne children over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1324
01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll get off on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1325
01:01:19.661 --> 01:01:20.680
<v Speaker 3>you're quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1326
01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:24.430
<v Speaker 3>You'll see that it's brilliant the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they've extricated themselves,</v>

1327
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:28.720
<v Speaker 3>that people's sort of shock impulse is </v>
<v Speaker 3>so readily available.</v>

1328
01:01:28.721 --> 01:01:30.780
<v Speaker 3>The bypasses their bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1329
01:01:30.781 --> 01:01:33.550
<v Speaker 3>oh hang on a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I being even told this now?</v>

1330
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like cause all of us on a personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

1331
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's things that we would say to</v>

1332
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:39.970
<v Speaker 3>one another that now if I'm with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend's parents,</v>

1333
01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just reframe you boil.</v>

1334
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.673
<v Speaker 3>We had a real laugh about the med Taleah</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recognize it and also doesn't it like </v>

1335
01:01:47.561 --> 01:01:48.394
<v Speaker 3>it's a language that has a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>like exact got codes in it that I know </v>

1336
01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 3>that mine are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my actual attitude is to mental illness.</v>

1337
01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I know my actual attitude is to death </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sadness and grief.</v>

1338
01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Didn't we not permit ourselves a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking latitude and a bit of relief?</v>

1339
01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's comedic license.</v>

1340
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.014
<v Speaker 4>I guess this is what we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately there's a comedic license in </v>

1341
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:10.090
<v Speaker 4>the same way that there's artistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>license or poetic license.</v>

1342
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:10.924
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a poet with the fucking sun </v>

1343
01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:14.020
<v Speaker 4>coming up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it like a lion?</v>

1344
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:15.530
<v Speaker 4>We cannot put the fuck you talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1345
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1346
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Clinics lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waking Up Sifford I happen to just say,</v>

1347
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:19.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could happen any time.</v>

1348
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 3>It don't make a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The screwed up.</v>

1349
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:22.090
<v Speaker 3>It's rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know we can,</v>

1350
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.970
<v Speaker 3>why don't we get this in license because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it's,</v>

1351
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 3>well let me look out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I've often thought of that,</v>

1352
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 3>that that that profanity being a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>better nation of territory.</v>

1353
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:33.204
<v Speaker 3>Like I enjoy doing comedy that is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting and rude and raw and raw </v>

1354
01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 3>curse I suppose get off in it and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>very in various ways.</v>

1355
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:39.474
<v Speaker 3>But I think what it also does is it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of act as a kind of explosion that </v>

1356
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 3>gives you access to different </v>
<v Speaker 3>territories that people are a little bit</v>

1357
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:47.880
<v Speaker 3>shaken and then you can sort of say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something beautiful or whatever.</v>

1358
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 3>But I think that that people would like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep the consciousness,</v>

1359
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:54.570
<v Speaker 3>the common consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public consciousness in existence on</v>

1360
01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:55.404
<v Speaker 3>certain neurological pathways that exist</v>
<v Speaker 3>on an individual level and on a </v>

1361
01:02:57.421 --> 01:02:58.254
<v Speaker 3>collective and dialectic level also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if you can untrammeled those </v>

1362
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:02.604
<v Speaker 3>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those grids with explosive behaviors </v>

1363
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 3>that that's dangerous.</v>

1364
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:06.683
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there's three things </v>

1365
01:03:07.321 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is you level late,</v>

1366
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:10.284
<v Speaker 4>what comedy can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you're not allowed to shock </v>

1367
01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 4>and you're not allowed to do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the start,</v>

1368
01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:14.754
<v Speaker 4>because often those jokes they get most </v>
<v Speaker 4>offended about or things you do to open </v>

1369
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:17.910
<v Speaker 4>up other subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1370
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that levels out what you can do.</v>

1371
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is they want to print </v>
<v Speaker 4>the jock.</v>

1372
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to put in the jaw,</v>

1373
01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.030
<v Speaker 4>they're look of Victorian freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1374
01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I look at the depravity but they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show it.</v>

1375
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.420
<v Speaker 3>But he does have perfectly formed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>janitor tools from,</v>

1376
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give me a quick give a wag </v>
<v Speaker 3>their cake and eat it.</v>

1377
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:38.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the other thing is just a </v>

1378
01:03:41.811 --> 01:03:46.811
<v Speaker 4>general thing they want to promote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the idea of Eh,</v>

1379
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:51.290
<v Speaker 4>public opinion as synonymous with press </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>

1380
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it ended up the public would rage but</v>

1381
01:03:53.711 --> 01:03:54.544
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we looked on twitter and we find some </v>

1382
01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:56.534
<v Speaker 4>people at Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can literally find anything if you </v>

1383
01:03:58.221 --> 01:04:01.100
<v Speaker 4>want to prevent the in from either side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an argument,</v>

1384
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.140
<v Speaker 4>just the tape and to twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people who say,</v>

1385
01:04:03.141 --> 01:04:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I hate yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yellow.</v>

1386
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.083
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what they want to do is make their </v>

1387
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 4>opinions synonymous with public,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public domain,</v>

1388
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.340
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1389
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.331
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to,</v>

1390
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:20.730
<v Speaker 3>to validate and mandate there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say it,</v>

1391
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.653
<v Speaker 3>Veltin showering I there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there I've said to allison showing it's </v>

1392
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>been said now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

1393
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

1394
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:28.250
<v Speaker 3>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1395
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.860
<v Speaker 3>that bears sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when we're talking about change,</v>

1396
01:04:31.861 --> 01:04:33.360
<v Speaker 3>social change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's kind of an,</v>

1397
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an obligation to reimagine in ways that </v>

1398
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:37.794
<v Speaker 3>a role for bold and may initially seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a bit mental in their boldness </v>

1399
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.880
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1400
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know quite how to do x.</v>

1401
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.823
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because people have been so </v>

1402
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:51.180
<v Speaker 3>beautifully schooled in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that,</v>

1403
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:52.014
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in rejecting radicalism of </v>

1404
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:58.380
<v Speaker 3>associating it with the other nurse is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the exotic,</v>

1405
01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>the feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mysterious,</v>

1406
01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 3>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I want to say,</v>

1407
01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:04.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1408
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 3>orient or to reject it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reject that.</v>

1409
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you say that,</v>

1410
01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:11.970
<v Speaker 3>why don't we just sort of break down all</v>
<v Speaker 3>superstructures and live in small,</v>

1411
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:14.870
<v Speaker 3>manageable communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like chimpanzees naturally works.</v>

1412
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.713
<v Speaker 3>We can't handle them on 75 relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just municipal infrastructure where </v>

1413
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:19.744
<v Speaker 3>required around transport and energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems and not have power that exists </v>

1414
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:23.674
<v Speaker 3>for profit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that we'll get our kicks and not </v>

1415
01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:28.830
<v Speaker 3>from consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by interfacing with the limit.</v>

1416
01:05:28.831 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 3>This beauty of the cosmos that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to for our consciousness.</v>

1417
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:33.243
<v Speaker 4>Vote for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can like there's that thing </v>

1418
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:37.264
<v Speaker 4>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What your seven stages away from the </v>

1419
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.290
<v Speaker 4>public there or would you imagine the </v>
<v Speaker 4>general public car,</v>

1420
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 4>but then you try and do that like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're rating.</v>

1421
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.433
<v Speaker 4>So I was trying to read a thing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>week with the British empire and the </v>

1422
01:05:46.281 --> 01:05:49.450
<v Speaker 4>idea of some people see the British </v>
<v Speaker 4>empires,</v>

1423
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was okay.</v>

1424
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 4>It was a mixed bag and it would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>empirically untrue,</v>

1425
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1426
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.953
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for some reason it's not okay to be </v>

1427
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 4>creationist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has all care to,</v>

1428
01:05:58.210 --> 01:05:59.043
<v Speaker 4>of maybe then poems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was massive excess deaths and it's </v>

1429
01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:04.270
<v Speaker 4>all in paddock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Provable.</v>

1430
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 4>And I brought some jargon with something</v>
<v Speaker 4>along the lines of,</v>

1431
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.073
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a tray somewhere who said a </v>

1432
01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:11.494
<v Speaker 4>stranger is a friend that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>met yet and I can't imagine who quite </v>

1433
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 4>clear they died out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you,</v>

1434
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 4>you sort of approach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn that,</v>

1435
01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:20.903
<v Speaker 4>how do I gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's through five stages may when I'm </v>

1436
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 4>right and had a good actually bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to the idea which is main,</v>

1437
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:29.660
<v Speaker 4>which is instinctively reject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1438
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.713
<v Speaker 4>ideas of empire.</v>

1439
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1440
01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:33.534
<v Speaker 3>Because it's difficult isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ravel and discard centuries if </v>

1441
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.640
<v Speaker 3>indoctrination like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1442
01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean I myself when abroad will sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1443
01:06:44.461 --> 01:06:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember the royal wedding was on when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in la and I was like,</v>

1444
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

1445
01:06:48.781 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

1446
01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:50.923
<v Speaker 3>So I like got swept up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know there were things where they sort </v>

1447
01:06:53.161 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 3>of got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is sort of a broad desire and,</v>

1448
01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.390
<v Speaker 3>and sort of possibly the wrong place to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explore it,</v>

1449
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.433
<v Speaker 3>but they showed how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like members of that congregation that </v>

1450
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.470
<v Speaker 3>day were dressed in literal Disney </v>
<v Speaker 3>costumes if you ever seen that.</v>

1451
01:07:04.471 --> 01:07:05.550
<v Speaker 3>But they kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1452
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 3>here's this person that's a Disney </v>
<v Speaker 3>costume.</v>

1453
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Like they found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but loads of,</v>

1454
01:07:08.731 --> 01:07:11.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that pepper middle turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's dressed like someone at butte in a</v>

1455
01:07:11.221 --> 01:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is that one.</v>

1456
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Hang on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bizarre.</v>

1457
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:19.450
<v Speaker 3>There's this sort of blending of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world of Disney and royal weddings,</v>

1458
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:20.993
<v Speaker 3>but regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point was that that a little bit of </v>

1459
01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:23.940
<v Speaker 3>pageantry and I was war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1460
01:07:23.941 --> 01:07:26.100
<v Speaker 3>whooped up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love a World Cup.</v>

1461
01:07:26.101 --> 01:07:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I love a bit of tribalism.</v>

1462
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.813
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the electrically bro,</v>

1463
01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:31.730
<v Speaker 4>all that end as if the lost power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the royals,</v>

1464
01:07:31.731 --> 01:07:33.950
<v Speaker 4>so they didn't use to harm huge royal </v>
<v Speaker 4>weddings.</v>

1465
01:07:33.951 --> 01:07:34.784
<v Speaker 4>It's a fairly modern trend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also they're going to need to like </v>

1466
01:07:38.571 --> 01:07:41.600
<v Speaker 4>stopped shooting the cameras that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead to stop turning the cameras,</v>

1467
01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:42.434
<v Speaker 4>render in their audience eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So unrepresentative of brand and it's </v>

1468
01:07:44.721 --> 01:07:47.860
<v Speaker 4>like [inaudible] Sanchez funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1469
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:50.060
<v Speaker 4>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody needs to see those people.</v>

1470
01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to need to just focus on </v>
<v Speaker 4>something else,</v>

1471
01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The revelation you can no longer,</v>

1472
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I suppose now with the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disseminate information is more and more</v>

1473
01:07:58.421 --> 01:07:59.254
<v Speaker 3>difficult to control the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while social media is still a </v>

1474
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 3>corporate spear and controlled by those </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

1475
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interests,</v>

1476
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 3>it's that just the information itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to have an impact.</v>

1477
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I said Ronins like I went two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a pace,</v>

1478
01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 3>were interviewed Keith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard took about 10 minutes.</v>

1479
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:18.494
<v Speaker 3>We've met to write 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>words like so for Rolling Stone Gig and </v>

1480
01:08:21.651 --> 01:08:22.484
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stones themselves carefully manage </v>

1481
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.533
<v Speaker 3>the letting you see their audience </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the elderly now altamont </v>

1482
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose all empires,</v>

1483
