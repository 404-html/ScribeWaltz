1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to a lot of George </v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.713
<v Speaker 1>Orwell audiobooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's amazing because there's these </v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>huge passages where he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>what incredible foresight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how amazing.</v>

5
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And then there's I'm a bitchy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

6
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>that's not how it turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>like Hitler has not yet kicked off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the road to Wigan pier is going,</v>

8
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit at the bloke,</v>

9
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to be trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.023
<v Speaker 1>I've got quick George do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's like a speculation </v>

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>about like how other things are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pan out and it sort of a,</v>

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is the necessity for </v>

13
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.004
<v Speaker 1>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does point out that like that </v>

14
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>socialism's requirement for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanization and a mechanized utopia.</v>

15
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.794
<v Speaker 1>We'll foul and I can't help but return </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that Gandy said prior to </v>

16
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the Indian revolution throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British.</v>

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.023
<v Speaker 1>There's no point in overthrowing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British in order to simply replace them </v>

18
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and their systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Gandy failed and disrespect.</v>

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.713
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi had a vision of turning India </v>

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>into this collection of Agrarian Turkic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopias.</v>

21
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing left of Gandhi's </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision in the core and Indian economy is</v>

22
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>his image on these rupee notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing left.</v>

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi's analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>was inappropriate for the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't,</v>

26
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very nice vision to have India as</v>

27
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.184
<v Speaker 1>a collection of agrarian utopias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just irrelevant to how the economy </v>

28
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>functions in the late 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say functions,</v>

29
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions in order to suit the needs of </v>

30
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.064
<v Speaker 1>the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have functioned pretty bloody </v>

31
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.254
<v Speaker 1>good for most agrarian Indian villages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wouldn't have functioned well </v>

32
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>for the capitalist relationships that </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to be maintained.</v>

33
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.213
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it was the British in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge or the Indians that were in </v>

34
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.561
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what exactly went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from the very beginning,</v>

37
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly Nairu and the,</v>

38
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:48.714
<v Speaker 1>and the leadership did not try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement Gandhi's vision in a serious </v>

39
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely because they also realized,</v>

40
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

41
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not workable because most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want power.</v>

42
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

43
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>they want food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you could narrow that food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>narratives never discussing whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not he was going to have food.</v>

46
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>He's getting food personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indian people.</v>

47
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>But when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>we have a one point something billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians to feed,</v>

49
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.633
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a lot of room for errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>or fraud maneuvers in the economic </v>

51
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

52
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing is that today in </v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

53
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>more people die from eating too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>than from eating too little.</v>

54
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Even in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just in the west.</v>

55
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a perversion.</v>

56
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>that's mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to enough full system.</v>

58
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's not enough so then we </v>

59
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>can abandon the idea that scarcity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

60
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Organization is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much food here.</v>

61
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough food over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the food not gain over there?</v>

62
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.813
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't suit the interest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful to the food for the food to go </v>

63
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.364
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we affect the interest of the </v>

64
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.044
<v Speaker 1>powerful we organize ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we challenge the interest of the </v>

65
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.084
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are the powerful is these companies </v>

66
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.850
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these governmental organizations here?</v>

67
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Key question to know who are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful world power is in?</v>

68
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>How does it function?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>

69
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.933
<v Speaker 1>You mean the power is concealed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The true power without getting too </v>

70
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.924
<v Speaker 1>conspiratorial?</v>

71
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly the modern world for a </v>

72
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>couple of centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main functions of power is to</v>

73
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>conceal power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is kind of a low of history.</v>

74
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to exaggerate your power.</v>

75
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>If you have a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to conceal it.</v>

76
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>If you're a king in England in the 12th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

77
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.133
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you tried to conceal your weakness </v>

78
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.993
<v Speaker 1>by these extravagant displays of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go with like a pile of gold on </v>

79
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:48.874
<v Speaker 1>your head and you were all these furs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pearls and every now and then you </v>

80
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

81
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>cut off his head and that makes people </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>

82
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very powerful.</v>

83
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>But actually he's very weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

84
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.813
<v Speaker 1>because the state is fairly weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you move to the modern age and </v>

85
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>leaders in governments really have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous amount of power but they won't,</v>

86
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>don't want to attract too much attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

87
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So you know that they dressed plainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an ordinary person and uh,</v>

88
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live in a much lower light.</v>

89
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't go about telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

90
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>cut off his head because they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to draw attention to all that power.</v>

91
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v Speaker 1>So in point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to know where power </v>

92
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.654
<v Speaker 1>really lies in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pageantry conceals ordinariness our </v>

93
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>flags out precessions all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this pageantry,</v>

94
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:40.174
<v Speaker 1>all this ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this ceremony helps us to believe </v>

95
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there is a United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an,</v>

96
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>England is not just a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic idea and a bit of land and some</v>

97
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>powerful people exploiting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

98
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a flag.</v>

99
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>There's an eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a symbol,</v>

100
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real,</v>

101
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.913
<v Speaker 1>but bit by bit who am picking you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitch and you discover there's nothing </v>

102
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>there except some powerful people </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploiting some people without power.</v>

103
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>That is your America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is your England,</v>

104
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>that is you're Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Saudi Arabia.</v>

105
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.863
<v Speaker 1>All just myths and stories so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful can continue to exploit the </v>

106
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>powerlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a crown on her head or some</v>

107
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.384
<v Speaker 1>stars and stripes on a flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first thing that people have to be </v>

108
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>disabused of is their myths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism.</v>

109
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Or then whatever method it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing them from acting in their own</v>

110
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.783
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated and complicated </v>

111
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>and that cause I'll get people moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take for example the,</v>

112
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.781
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.614
<v Speaker 1>the Arab spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all started off very </v>

114
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>optimistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wonderful.</v>

115
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>We have a democratic revolution of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

116
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>The people now gain power and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hijacked and the collage,</v>

117
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the curves were turned in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

118
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And we now have a much worse situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>than before.</v>

119
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean Egyptians and Syrians and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

120
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Yemen and in,</v>

121
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>and they look back and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not why we had the revolution.</v>

122
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really failed.</v>

123
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think they had no idea.</v>

124
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.213
<v Speaker 1>The Islamic Brotherhood have an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you liked the idea or you don't </v>

125
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>like the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our idea.</v>

126
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>This is how we see society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our vision.</v>

127
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>The people that are on twitter don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vision for the site.</v>

128
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous just to go out,</v>

129
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>say on twitter and tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

130
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>go to the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take out the Kalashnikovs,</v>

131
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:29.010
<v Speaker 1>fight against power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

132
00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:29.551
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a week off revolution,</v>

134
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but then if you don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual palace structure,</v>

135
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>then your revolution will be hijacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and directed in,</v>

136
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.391
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

137
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:42.990
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

138
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards goals which are not necessarily </v>

139
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.360
<v Speaker 1>the best goals in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

140
00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:53.361
<v Speaker 1>like Spain in the 30s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brief flicker of an Arco Cinder colorism</v>

141
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.940
<v Speaker 1>ultimately becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism,</v>

142
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>becomes neo.</v>

143
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I know so many examples of neo is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>century ago in Russia,</v>

144
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.613
<v Speaker 1>you heard the Bolshevik revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within a very short time you heard </v>

145
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>stallion and the gulags and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

146
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

147
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by within two or three years,</v>

148
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.543
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks were firing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers and peasants that they were </v>

149
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>supposed to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the,</v>

150
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:19.324
<v Speaker 1>the famous case of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the crunch dot sailors in the garage </v>

151
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 1>dot workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in 1917,</v>

152
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of the avant garde of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

153
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.543
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bolshevik government was massive </v>

154
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very same workers in crunch dot.</v>

155
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Which in the beginning where the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes of the revolution,</v>

156
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it depends on whether you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic perspective or not.</v>

157
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:40.534
<v Speaker 1>There's some days where I feel human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are capable of creating this </v>

158
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

159
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I believe that this technology can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>harnessed to create,</v>

160
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

161
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world of justice and liberty then,</v>

162
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.640
<v Speaker 1>then I'll hear like about some terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugee crises in Burma and think,</v>

163
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just leave it as it is now.</v>

164
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.511
<v Speaker 1>And this is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause I didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel then when the aggravation,</v>

166
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>but to return for a moment to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic perspective,</v>

167
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.460
<v Speaker 1>if you can identify the powerful and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

168
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 1>and you have a vision of a society that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be differently organized.</v>

169
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>This for me is to ingredient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big if,</v>

170
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look today the world,</v>

171
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>what strikes me most is that nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

172
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>nobody in either the left or the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>has any serious,</v>

173
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:26.474
<v Speaker 1>meaningful vision for where you monitor </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be in 2015 most of what you get is </v>

174
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic fantasies about the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

175
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.713
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have a serious vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which takes into account a I and </v>

176
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:45.071
<v Speaker 1>biotechnology and climate change in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and really looks clearly at what,</v>

177
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>where can we be in 2015</v>

178
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.883
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
