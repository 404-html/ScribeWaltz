<v Speaker 2>thanks for coming on.</v>

22
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to you for such a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.253
<v Speaker 2>And I've heard from so many of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutual audience members that we should </v>

24
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.214
<v Speaker 2>be getting together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

25
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>because I suppose in the works for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

27
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.834
<v Speaker 2>We exist in that sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sonic boom created by Joe Rogan </v>

28
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you want Joe Rogan?</v>

30
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I listened to waking up and I've heard a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of your stuff.</v>

31
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I saw you on Joe Rogan as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

32
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Joe Joe is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 800 pound gorilla of podcasters.</v>

33
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Casey is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows.</v>

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the</v>

35
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>very much that we are all orbiting Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan let's face yet.</v>

36
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

37
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>there's so much stuff I want to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

38
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's loads of things we agree</v>

39
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.504
<v Speaker 1>on loads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some pretty distinct </v>

40
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>things that I imagine we disagree on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose these will be some of the,</v>

41
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>some interesting things to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

42
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to analyze.</v>

43
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to start us off,</v>

44
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

45
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.770
<v Speaker 1>tell us a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

46
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:07.771
<v Speaker 1>the fusion of neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and atheism and the,</v>

47
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.091
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

48
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:09.924
<v Speaker 1>it's become sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the defining of people's perception of </v>

49
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a sort of a,</v>

50
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a neurological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a underwriting for your sort of personal</v>

51
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>perspective of atheism and how you fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

52
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.114
<v Speaker 1>what you've learned in this sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 years since you've come to </v>

53
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>prominence and how your positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps evolved.</v>

54
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

55
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:26.894
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atheism connection is probably just </v>

56
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.034
<v Speaker 3>an accident of history more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything because it really is what </v>

57
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 3>happened to my intellectual life right </v>
<v Speaker 3>after September 11th.</v>

58
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 3>So I was doing my neuroscience phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a background in philosophy.</v>

59
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:42.854
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went into neuroscience very much with </v>

60
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 3>the interest of a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

61
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I was always interested in understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human mind at a,</v>

62
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a high,</v>

63
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 3>a high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a level that really about,</v>

64
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 3>would only be doing work in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in people.</v>

65
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.194
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't ever thinking of curing </v>

66
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:00.064
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was all about just understanding </v>

67
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 3>human subjectivity and consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality and,</v>

68
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human reason.</v>

69
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these were the kinds of,</v>

70
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher level mental attributes that </v>

71
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 3>interested in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was doing my,</v>

72
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I was in the middle of my phd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had done my coursework,</v>

73
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 3>I was getting into neuro imaging work on</v>
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>

74
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I was studying the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief and disbelief and uncertainty.</v>

75
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 3>And then September 11th happened and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

76
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I had a background in meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a background in explicitly,</v>

77
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.253
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to cash out rather ancient </v>

78
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.100
<v Speaker 3>spiritual concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

79
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.863
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through whatever methodology was </v>

80
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had,</v>

81
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had taken psychedelics in my twenties.</v>

82
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I had spent about two years on silent </v>
<v Speaker 3>retreat.</v>

83
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

84
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.523
<v Speaker 3>very connected to the experiential side </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what people think they're only </v>

85
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 3>religion is good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

86
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 3>But I was not a believer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

87
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

88
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 3>of any sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

89
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

90
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
<v Speaker 3>I was an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never thought of myself as an </v>

91
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.354
<v Speaker 3>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was totally unaware of atheism as an </v>

92
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 3>organized political movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't have told you who Madelyn,</v>

93
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Mario hair was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

94
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 3>there's a famous atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

95
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:16.764
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was aware of people like Richard </v>

96
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Dawkins for their science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was not someone who had read books</v>

97
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:23.704
<v Speaker 3>on atheism.</v>

98
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 3>And so my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of faith,</v>

99
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really was the really initiated </v>

100
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.154
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this publishing phenomenon that was </v>

101
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 3>called the new atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

102
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 3>because then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was me and then Dawkins,</v>

103
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.374
<v Speaker 3>and then I came out with my second book </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Dan Dennett and Christopher </v>

104
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Hitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us had these books that came out.</v>

105
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even used the word atheism in </v>

106
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 3>the end of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

107
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that I thought not to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just was not a word I used.</v>

108
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 3>So I was just talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict between reason and faith,</v>

109
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 3>the con conflict between science and </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

110
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the obvious untenable realty.</v>

111
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.224
<v Speaker 3>I mean that the actual proper horror of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we have a world that has </v>

112
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:03.934
<v Speaker 3>shattered into these separate religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities and these separate and </v>

113
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:11.821
<v Speaker 3>incommensurable worldviews based on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adherence to these ancient books.</v>

114
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that strikes me as,</v>

115
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.473
<v Speaker 3>and then as it struck me then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it strikes me now as just as </v>

116
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.814
<v Speaker 3>perverse as people blowing themselves up</v>
<v Speaker 3>over rival interpretations of </v>

117
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

118
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>just imagine there was some hamlet cult </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus some king lear cult,</v>

119
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.083
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people are willing to die for these </v>

120
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those cults exists.</v>

121
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the world we're living in.</v>

122
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our world is just that absurd.</v>

123
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 3>And so I reacted to all of this in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of September 11th,</v>

124
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.713
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without ever defining myself in my own </v>

125
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 3>mind as someone who was now shilling for</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheism.</v>

126
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 3>But then I got inducted into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the conversation about atheism.</v>

127
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

128
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 3>it's somewhat ironic that atheist is one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the first words that in my bio,</v>

129
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an</v>

130
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.673
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was retrospectively applied or though </v>

131
00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:02.284
<v Speaker 1>your [inaudible] you say you were kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the insight in incident of your </v>

132
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:06.844
<v Speaker 1>public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is a public in a lecturer was </v>

133
00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:10.810
<v Speaker 1>nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>

134
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidly defined as a,</v>

135
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.993
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've suppose judging from what you've </v>

136
00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 1>just said as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a religious event primarily or an act of</v>

137
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>religious violence.</v>

138
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was,</v>

139
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:25.304
<v Speaker 3>it was clearly that you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about other variables that could </v>

140
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.850
<v Speaker 3>explain it or that could of could of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

141
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other motives that,</v>

142
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 3>that people might have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

143
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 3>you might want to talk about politics or</v>
<v Speaker 3>economics or,</v>

144
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.260
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

145
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 3>US foreign policy with a legacy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonialism.</v>

146
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:45.764
<v Speaker 3>But I think it is absolutely clear that </v>
<v Speaker 3>while those variables account for some </v>

147
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the misbehavior in our world,</v>

148
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.153
<v Speaker 3>there are still people who get up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning with 100% of their motivation </v>

149
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 3>being a religious expectation of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterlife.</v>

150
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people exist.</v>

151
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.253
<v Speaker 3>I can just find you these people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have none of the other variables that </v>

152
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 3>people would want to use to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the terrestrial variables,</v>

153
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 3>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

154
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 3>there are people who have never suffered</v>
<v Speaker 3>any economic insecurity who devote their</v>

155
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.964
<v Speaker 3>life to Jihad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who drop out of the </v>

156
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.493
<v Speaker 3>London School of economics who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>British citizens so that they can go </v>

157
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>fight with Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

158
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

159
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.220
<v Speaker 1>what does that to you imply the toxicity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of religious ideology?</v>

160
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.081
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

161
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 3>it's the power of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even,</v>

162
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.380
<v Speaker 3>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even purely toxic.</v>

163
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:43.961
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>

164
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:48.961
<v Speaker 3>the horrible paradox here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the experience of people even in</v>

165
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the most extreme,</v>

166
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and we might want to say psychopathic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cults,</v>

167
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like Isis.</v>

168
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.130
<v Speaker 3>The experience by and large is not of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a psychopath.</v>

169
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like Isis.</v>

170
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.540
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're sort of now focusing on,</v>

171
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.733
<v Speaker 3>obviously my criticism of religion is </v>
<v Speaker 3>much wider than focusing on </v>

172
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to take this case,</v>

173
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>many people think that Isis was acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bug light for the world.</v>

174
00:08:18.571 --> 00:08:19.404
<v Speaker 3>Psychopaths that only psychopaths would </v>
<v Speaker 3>go over there and behave this badly and </v>

175
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.953
<v Speaker 3>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about is bad people </v>

176
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.193
<v Speaker 3>who would behave badly anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are people who were going to rape </v>

177
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 3>and kill any way and they just found an </v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse or a,</v>

178
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:37.290
<v Speaker 3>or a pretext by which to do it under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ages of religion.</v>

179
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.150
<v Speaker 3>That's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

180
00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:42.340
<v Speaker 3>we just know enough about the bios of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that it's,</v>

181
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.263
<v Speaker 3>and you would never say that of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was observing some other religious </v>

182
00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:53.511
<v Speaker 3>behavior slavishly under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under some doctrines.</v>

183
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 3>that you wouldn't explain the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people at the mass,</v>

185
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the Catholic mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 3>where they line up to eat a cracker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't say,</v>

187
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.260
<v Speaker 3>well this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

188
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.233
<v Speaker 3>politically motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack reading behavior of these people </v>

189
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 3>would find pretext,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat crackers on Sundays anyway.</v>

190
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.211
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

191
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:13.044
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would ritualize their cracker </v>

192
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 3>eating behavior for some other reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

193
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a belief that explains exactly</v>

194
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing with this cracker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll tell you,</v>

195
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:22.111
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

196
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not,</v>

197
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:23.660
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

198
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a doctrine that they're following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if a doctor,</v>

199
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 3>if the doctor and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat two crackers,</v>

200
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 3>they'd be in two crackers.</v>

201
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I personally,</v>

202
00:09:31.361 --> 00:09:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and presumably you would agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

203
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.653
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic mass is serving a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular function as all ritual and </v>

204
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:44.071
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies and the literalness if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracker is secondary to it's evident,</v>

205
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>perfunctory role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.003
<v Speaker 1>a place for social cohesion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement of mortality and the </v>

208
00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:55.924
<v Speaker 1>potential for the human soul or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human essence to aspire to something </v>

209
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.473
<v Speaker 1>beyond the carnal blood and body drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we take Christ from a more </v>

210
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:10.111
<v Speaker 1>theological as opposed to sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sort of reductive simplistic.</v>

211
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And I think for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritually useless perspective as,</v>

212
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:16.504
<v Speaker 1>as like the metaphor of Christ being </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the potential for transcendence </v>

213
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.690
<v Speaker 1>beyond the flesh individual to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened male that Oh,</v>

214
00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.560
<v Speaker 1>the enlightened being I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.623
<v Speaker 1>then the sort of the mass for me is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to ceremoniously </v>

216
00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged that meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I,</v>

217
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I would look at a mass and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

218
00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:39.080
<v Speaker 1>this ain't about literally in crackers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

219
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.933
<v Speaker 1>and in even the metaphor as explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stated in the scriptural terms of that </v>

220
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>denomination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more that even that is limited.</v>

221
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I would say that people drive to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

222
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.960
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Mariam is Mariam.</v>

223
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.421
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

224
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 3>you're flipping the logic of what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

225
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 3>So I'm saying that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>explains the actual ritual,</v>

226
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 3>the cracker eating is the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

227
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 3>If the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're different,</v>

228
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 3>if the doctrine where if Jesus had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

229
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 3>this bread is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has nothing to do with my body.</v>

230
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't matter what you do at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mass,</v>

231
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat anything right to eat anything</v>

232
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 3>is to pollute your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should just be thinking about me,</v>

233
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was the doctrine,</v>

234
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 3>there would be no cracker eating ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

235
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the doctrine is,</v>

236
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:21.601
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

237
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a bizarre act of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

238
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human sacrifice and cannibalism at the,</v>

239
00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:27.794
<v Speaker 3>at the bottom of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't make a hell of a lot of </v>

240
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:29.690
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

241
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.523
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the roots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural diety worship and the </v>

242
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:35.084
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the known and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and the necessity to have </v>

243
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>relationship with plants or season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

244
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.464
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't</v>

245
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.700
<v Speaker 3>gonna be eating his body like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

246
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.650
<v Speaker 3>like they wouldn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people</v>

247
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>except as a metaphor for union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>But in oneness.</v>

249
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except it's not taught.</v>

250
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not preached as a metaphor and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine's not metaphorical.</v>

251
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.193
<v Speaker 3>I will grant you that many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people aren't thinking about it </v>

252
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:57.964
<v Speaker 3>literally now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's just to say they've lost </v>

253
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 3>their faith in the actual doctrine of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

254
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.383
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I think we have to look beyond </v>

255
00:12:04.701 --> 00:12:06.050
<v Speaker 1>rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when we're dealing,</v>

256
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a man who is deeply interested </v>

257
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:09.830
<v Speaker 1>in mysticism and spirituality in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

258
00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Once it's on the plane of the corporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rational,</v>

259
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.020
<v Speaker 1>then it to evaluate the symbols purely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally,</v>

260
00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:21.950
<v Speaker 1>they're always going to be sort of kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of left wanting because yeah,</v>

261
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.793
<v Speaker 1>the in a wafer or drinking some wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a relationship with the </v>

262
00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:27.870
<v Speaker 1>wholeness,</v>

263
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I would be slow to conclude that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

264
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you have to be irrational </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use these tools</v>

265
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>or beyond rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the rational,</v>

266
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>not like a necessarily less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>

267
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>possibly more than that.</v>

268
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Clearly more than form any rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the universe.</v>

269
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 3>There's more to life than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

270
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's fun,</v>

271
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 3>there's love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's beauty,</v>

272
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:53.580
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's uh,</v>

273
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 3>there's more that we want out from life </v>
<v Speaker 3>than simply not being wrong.</v>

274
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.523
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not saying that that reason is </v>

275
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is,</v>

276
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.790
<v Speaker 3>do you ever have to be irrational to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond merely conceptually understanding</v>

277
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 3>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever have to lie to yourself?</v>

278
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.573
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever ever have to have to lie to </v>
<v Speaker 3>others or believe the lies of others to </v>

279
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 3>go beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go into these other areas that,</v>

280
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.873
<v Speaker 3>that no one would know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most people are living as though </v>

281
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:22.564
<v Speaker 3>absolutely you do that because religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just the most profligate example of </v>

282
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 3>lying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that any and self deception.</v>

283
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.950
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politics is it,</v>

284
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's</v>

285
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 3>every bit as bad except then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it pauses an afterlife where it gets all</v>

286
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:37.350
<v Speaker 3>cashed out</v>

287
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.420
<v Speaker 1>except of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like again to return to the point about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 11 new or particularly induction.</v>

289
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:43.974
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wittingly or otherwise I into what's </v>

290
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:51.180
<v Speaker 1>being come known as the new atheistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

291
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

292
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.590
<v Speaker 1>this is a question I suppose if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular event taken in isolation,</v>

293
00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Bob Barry can horrific and dreadfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic and totemic.</v>

295
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but definitely taking place within a </v>

296
00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:13.800
<v Speaker 1>historical context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

297
00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:17.040
<v Speaker 1>they're very variables that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleetingly mentioned economics,</v>

298
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 1>colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these like how do we delineate,</v>

299
00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:20.814
<v Speaker 1>how do we sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are these imaginary lines drawn </v>

300
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.790
<v Speaker 1>between this is religious violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is political violence.</v>

301
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:29.910
<v Speaker 1>This is acceptable violence to who draws</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

302
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

303
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.580
<v Speaker 3>they can be very easily drawn when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you take the case of any individual</v>

304
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 3>and his or her motives</v>

305
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

306
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>we have to resort to individualism as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to cultural,</v>

307
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:42.963
<v Speaker 1>national movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take that individual is </v>

308
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.910
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that state and that state action,</v>

309
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I would first say that very few of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are crazy.</v>

310
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.133
<v Speaker 3>So let me just break this down a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit because there are many different </v>

311
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 3>types of violence and so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

312
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.350
<v Speaker 3>there are crazy people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy in,</v>

313
00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

314
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more clinical sense of that term,</v>

315
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.644
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say they're suffering some </v>

316
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 3>thought disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

317
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:09.610
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

318
00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:10.444
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're suffering from some kind of </v>

319
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:11.630
<v Speaker 3>delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

320
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.470
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

321
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 3>many of the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia,</v>

322
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

323
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 3>there are probably other ways we want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

324
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>class a thought disorder here,</v>

325
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 3>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not rational.</v>

326
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't have rational goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hearing voices.</v>

327
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.170
<v Speaker 3>They think they're talking to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.013
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the son of Sam thought his dog was </v>

329
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 3>telling him to kill people.</v>

330
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Next door's dog at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

331
00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

332
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.440
<v Speaker 2>we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

333
00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to your own dark,</v>

334
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 2>rough night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

335
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 2>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and different from everyone else.</v>

336
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.370
<v Speaker 3>People who are mentally ill are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

337
00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:51.340
<v Speaker 3>But there are some people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally ill who are right now,</v>

338
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.700
<v Speaker 3>there are people who do horrific things </v>
<v Speaker 3>for no ideological motive,</v>

339
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.120
<v Speaker 3>no rational animus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but purely because they're crazy,</v>

340
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take like every one example would</v>

341
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:08.251
<v Speaker 3>be probably this Guy Adam Lanza who went</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the school in Newtown and killed 20</v>

342
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:11.920
<v Speaker 3>some odd children and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and half a dozen teachers,</v>

343
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 26 people were gunned down.</v>

344
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.670
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>

345
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.504
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anyone gave a diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was probably almost certainly </v>

346
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:22.210
<v Speaker 3>on the autistic spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had something else going on,</v>

347
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.313
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a white supremacist who had </v>

348
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:27.910
<v Speaker 3>some ideology who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was acting out in this way.</v>

349
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.360
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a jihadist who thought he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get into paradise.</v>

350
00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

351
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.653
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are many other examples of </v>

352
00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:37.210
<v Speaker 3>mass shootings like that.</v>

353
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Jared lauffner was a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know who,</v>

354
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:40.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

355
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.673
<v Speaker 3>whereas you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to talk to this person </v>

356
00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:43.414
<v Speaker 3>and find out why he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing is going to make sense right </v>

357
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.490
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is very different.</v>

358
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.983
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we could talk about the same </v>

359
00:16:51.521 --> 00:16:55.390
<v Speaker 3>superficial crime of going in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing children in a school,</v>

360
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

361
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.410
<v Speaker 3>there's that version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the,</v>

362
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really angry,</v>

363
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would argue,</v>

364
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.810
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadistic,</v>

365
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.890
<v Speaker 3>eat classically evil person who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to kill kids,</v>

366
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.753
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who just gets off on all of the misery </v>

367
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:17.410
<v Speaker 3>he's going to create as a result of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime.</v>

368
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Now this person is not suffering a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought disorder.</v>

369
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Now we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we knew more about the brain,</v>

370
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I think in the end we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would be happy to say,</v>

371
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:25.414
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still something wrong with this </v>

372
00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:26.471
<v Speaker 3>guy's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

373
00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:29.980
<v Speaker 3>we're human evil is a species of </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurological disorder,</v>

374
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.203
<v Speaker 3>but we don't understand it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now where it's tempting just to </v>

375
00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:33.521
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

376
00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:34.630
<v Speaker 3>these people are evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

377
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the first person.</v>

378
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

379
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.454
<v Speaker 3>there's probably into the boundary </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those people are or can be kind </v>

380
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:43.354
<v Speaker 3>of fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

381
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.430
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are different types of people.</v>

382
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

383
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.990
<v Speaker 3>get to the worst case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst case is there are,</v>

384
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.603
<v Speaker 3>who are as good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever are moral and as ethical and as </v>

385
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 3>committed to the wellbeing of themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and others as you and I are,</v>

386
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.073
<v Speaker 3>who still go in and shoot up schools and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill everybody and hope to die in the </v>

387
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:08.090
<v Speaker 3>process because they think they can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into paradise that way and get into p.</v>

388
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.953
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when members of the Taliban went into a </v>

389
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:15.760
<v Speaker 3>school in Pakistan and killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 137 kids and,</v>

390
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and burn their teacher alive in front of</v>

391
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

392
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

393
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all members of the Taliban who endorsed,</v>

394
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 3>who did this and then all of those and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Taliban who endorsed this,</v>

395
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 3>we're all just psychopaths or mentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>ill.</v>

396
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

397
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to what their,</v>

398
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.083
<v Speaker 3>where they believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read the texts that they think </v>

399
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 3>are the verbatim word of the creator of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>

400
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.363
<v Speaker 3>it all falls into place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is perfectly rational behavior </v>

401
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.964
<v Speaker 3>given the requisite beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is what is so horrible about </v>

402
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 3>this kind of dogmatism.</v>

403
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.723
<v Speaker 1>Even that process or that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme example of the execution of </v>

404
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:49.814
<v Speaker 1>children in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You base of an elective reading of even </v>

405
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:55.100
<v Speaker 1>that particular doctorate and it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular like passages you go,</v>

406
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:57.620
<v Speaker 1>oh is the passage where the sort of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

407
00:18:57.621 --> 00:18:58.454
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately there's loads of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like live a peaceful life of </v>

408
00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 1>devotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] have you read the Quran?</v>

409
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you read the Quran cover to cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw bloody,</v>

410
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.933
<v Speaker 1>we're laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's mainly got through these notes </v>

411
00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>for this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm doing this thing on the flight.</v>

412
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.633
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it at the point it's a short </v>

413
00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:14.534
<v Speaker 1>book or like my general feeling is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Quran holy is like most religious </v>

414
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:21.404
<v Speaker 1>scripture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intention is to create a social </v>

415
00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:27.740
<v Speaker 1>environment where people are benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cohesive,</v>

416
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.603
<v Speaker 1>which ultimately became a tool for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social control as a result of the way </v>

417
00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 1>the power structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more than that.</v>

418
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's likely the religion in politics,</v>

419
00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

420
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:38.084
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't deliberately misread the </v>

421
00:19:39.441 --> 00:19:40.340
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

422
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.680
<v Speaker 1>life after death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a person who spent two years</v>

423
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.030
<v Speaker 1>in a silent matree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavi,</v>

424
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.903
<v Speaker 1>you with Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is that beyond the life that is </v>

425
00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:47.924
<v Speaker 1>determined by primal desires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biographical wants and your imagination </v>

426
00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:53.684
<v Speaker 1>of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a life after the death of that </v>

427
00:19:56.991 --> 00:19:57.824
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that individual dies and you </v>

428
00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:03.020
<v Speaker 1>recognize that the temporal can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide fulfillment,</v>

429
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.070
<v Speaker 1>you gain access to a sort of a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and after life,</v>

430
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:10.370
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and man sees it,</v>

431
00:20:10.371 --> 00:20:13.910
<v Speaker 1>not the Kingdom of Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life after the death of your ego.</v>

432
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

433
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say I would like if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about that,</v>

434
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's talking about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the value of that would be as a,</v>

435
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a manual for being,</v>

436
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>for being human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much,</v>

437
00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:26.810
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

438
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:27.643
<v Speaker 1>hold on a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got go for you did a big </v>

439
00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:32.990
<v Speaker 1>classification system of the degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who we've got to do the schools.</v>

440
00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:33.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we'll do.</v>

441
00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Then do your flag and then we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the school.</v>

442
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 3>You want to acknowledge that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

443
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.513
<v Speaker 3>whatever</v>

444
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>personal reading breathing</v>

445
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.423
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people most of the time think that </v>

446
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 3>the afterlife is a literal place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go after die.</v>

447
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 3>That consciousness survives the death of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body.</v>

448
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.250
<v Speaker 3>And in the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the Christian,</v>

449
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 3>the Christian and the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Islamic tradition,</v>

450
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 3>it really matters whether you believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right thing or not.</v>

451
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:59.703
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact this life doesn't matter at all </v>

452
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>and that's what's so corrosive about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

453
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.093
<v Speaker 1>But like in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually look at some of the </v>

454
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:08.100
<v Speaker 1>alternatives now we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>

455
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:08.934
<v Speaker 1>their device to barometer of degrees if </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness and the worst types of madness </v>

456
00:21:12.331 --> 00:21:16.080
<v Speaker 1>and the worst way to tobacco your kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered in a school by which particular</v>

457
00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:17.250
<v Speaker 1>type of madman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:21:17.251 --> 00:21:18.720
<v Speaker 1>but we should probably bring into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix.</v>

459
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.273
<v Speaker 1>Not all men are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind kids killed in a school by </v>

460
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.183
<v Speaker 1>for any ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's grounded in sort of </v>

461
00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:33.111
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and economics or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a book that's a bit older and more,</v>

462
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>esoterical colorful or imaginative,</v>

463
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know sort of how to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

464
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:39.984
<v Speaker 1>But what I suppose what I suppose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of why I want to get to is whilst </v>

465
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:49.430
<v Speaker 1>undoubtably religion has been used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify violence from all types of Ang,</v>

466
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angles and in different historical </v>

467
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:57.570
<v Speaker 1>moments and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist violence in Burma and Christian</v>

468
00:21:57.571 --> 00:21:59.340
<v Speaker 1>violence in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.233
<v Speaker 1>like in the Middle East or sit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular violence underwritten by </v>

470
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.354
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resourced entirely from Christiana in </v>

471
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:05.844
<v Speaker 1>sort of Christian dualistic notions </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertaken by far right Christian </v>

472
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.820
<v Speaker 1>president and whatever.</v>

473
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the more lucid livid and office </v>

474
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and contemporaneous a far right is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremist Islamic violence.</v>

475
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

476
00:22:22.201 --> 00:22:27.201
<v Speaker 1>how do we see that as distinct from </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational violence,</v>

477
00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:28.224
<v Speaker 1>political violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when that is far more </v>

478
00:22:29.611 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 1>potent palm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more widespread.</v>

479
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.843
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is the violence of the </v>

480
00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:36.150
<v Speaker 1>dominant culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What interests me,</v>

481
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:41.151
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is power and the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me I'm interested in who gets to</v>

482
00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:46.590
<v Speaker 1>decide who the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets to decide by what metric.</v>

483
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.453
<v Speaker 1>Rationalism and religion is evaluated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that the kind of </v>

484
00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:52.284
<v Speaker 1>violence that's focused on in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work is the violence of desperate </v>

485
00:22:55.921 --> 00:23:00.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desperate possibly subjugated people.</v>

486
00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And I would say to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you don't do this,</v>

487
00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:07.890
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to educate me on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to dismiss the colonial aspect,</v>

488
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of economic aspect,</v>

489
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the occupation of Middle Eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and historical,</v>

490
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean if for me it seems like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you conduct that extraction?</v>

491
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:19.860
<v Speaker 1>How can you divorce those different </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of violence?</v>

492
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:22.110
<v Speaker 1>They seem to me to be part of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

493
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it very simply because you have</v>

494
00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.424
<v Speaker 3>exam just to dissect out the variable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>colonialism or oppression from the </v>

495
00:23:28.671 --> 00:23:30.260
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

496
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 3>you have examples of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been oppressed as,</v>

497
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.963
<v Speaker 3>as oppressed as any other people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't resort to this kind of violence </v>

498
00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:39.320
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have the same belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

499
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So take that.</v>

500
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.231
<v Speaker 3>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>

501
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:44.840
<v Speaker 3>an almost perfect scientific experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

502
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.423
<v Speaker 3>Palestinian Christians and Palestinian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims living in the same occupied </v>

503
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:52.334
<v Speaker 3>territories right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was blowing that well before the </v>

504
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Israelis put up the wall who was blowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves up in,</v>

505
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 3>in pizza parlors and discotheques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

506
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 3>It was 99.9%</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim,</v>

507
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not Christian.</v>

508
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.933
<v Speaker 3>You have Coptic Christians in Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 3>being murdered by their Muslim </v>

509
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.814
<v Speaker 3>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by suicide bombings who don't resort to </v>

510
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 3>their own suicide bombings in return.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

511
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.200
<v Speaker 3>It's the beliefs matter.</v>

512
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.063
<v Speaker 2>The details matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you fetishize the or antagonism </v>

513
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.710
<v Speaker 2>towards that particular type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence?</v>

514
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.471
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>

515
00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not a fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just violence exists in the context</v>

516
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 2>of a far more potent opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Violence.</v>

517
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:35.941
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

518
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:36.201
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

519
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:37.034
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

520
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he can't,</v>

521
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we can't talk about Palestinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

522
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And for Christian person you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge saying no,</v>

523
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:44.230
<v Speaker 2>not talking about history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

524
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.073
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we can because we can because </v>

525
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 2>you can have sweet though.</v>

526
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.453
<v Speaker 3>Moral morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in Orange County will be </v>

527
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 3>converted to this belief system and want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight in the name of this cause.</v>

528
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's purely a matter of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

529
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.390
<v Speaker 3>it's as much a matter of belief as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to go on a diet or a learning to</v>

530
00:25:03.391 --> 00:25:06.150
<v Speaker 3>meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I'll go to Hawaii this year for</v>

531
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.470
<v Speaker 2>my vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are ideas.</v>

532
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.131
<v Speaker 2>But luckily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:11.964
<v Speaker 2>you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in a sort of a secular society </v>

534
00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:18.691
<v Speaker 2>and our beliefs seldom come into </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition with the dominant philosophy.</v>

535
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And when it does there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are problems.</v>

536
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.860
<v Speaker 3>W what worries me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was really,</v>

537
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:27.611
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that might be here.</v>

538
00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:28.444
<v Speaker 3>My background concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ideas are the most powerful </v>

539
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:34.840
<v Speaker 3>things we've got right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideas are the operating system for human</v>

540
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:35.674
<v Speaker 3>life and human culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we fail to build a civilization </v>

541
00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:40.504
<v Speaker 3>that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be because of the failure of </v>

542
00:25:42.221 --> 00:25:43.054
<v Speaker 3>ideas or our failure to communicate good</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas to one another in such a way </v>

543
00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:46.960
<v Speaker 3>that's persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

544
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.520
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

545
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.700
<v Speaker 3>how do you get 7 billion strangers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>peacefully collaborate with one another?</v>

546
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.013
<v Speaker 3>It is a matter of conversation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately gets people to converge on </v>

547
00:25:57.251 --> 00:26:00.760
<v Speaker 3>common projects and common values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so all we have is conversation.</v>

548
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.420
<v Speaker 3>And when conversation fails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all we have is violence,</v>

549
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

550
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.650
<v Speaker 3>there's really just two modes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in violence and what you're</v>

551
00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 3>talking about when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and it's misuses,</v>

552
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.410
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about state violence or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or state coercion,</v>

553
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you deem to be illegitimate.</v>

554
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Now I'll grant you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we,</v>

555
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.350
<v Speaker 3>if we took a list of all of these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 3>CIA run coups and other countries where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

557
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you and I may just check the same box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

558
00:26:28.391 --> 00:26:29.224
<v Speaker 3>well that looks legitimate or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had consequences that could have </v>

559
00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:32.284
<v Speaker 3>easily been foreseen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people suffered and died there </v>

560
00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't have the objectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it.</v>

561
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

562
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.950
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

563
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.340
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm looking at cases of,</v>

564
00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:43.174
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I prompt prioritize kind of the </v>

565
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 3>light of shining the light of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism on specific ideas and specific</v>

566
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 3>human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking by and large for the,</v>

567
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.243
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the craziest and most dangerous ideas </v>

568
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.640
<v Speaker 3>that should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

569
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 3>this is really the low hanging fruit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of bad epistemology.</v>

570
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.043
<v Speaker 3>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human behavior that should seem </v>

571
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 3>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

572
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:08.364
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and suicide bombing was not a drone </v>

573
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 3>bombing.</v>

574
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just aesthetics because because</v>

575
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 3>suicidal people are undetectable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so jihadists are undetectable.</v>

576
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.853
<v Speaker 3>If part of it's the best thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in an operation is that you die </v>

577
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 3>while conducting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are the perfect weapon.</v>

578
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

579
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 3>but I just have to hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to hammer this home.</v>

580
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.663
<v Speaker 3>When you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of something like nuclear </v>

581
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:42.670
<v Speaker 3>terrorism or biological terrorism that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

582
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.840
<v Speaker 3>when someone tries to weaponize </v>
<v Speaker 3>smallpox,</v>

583
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 3>killed 100 million patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear terrorism,</v>

584
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 3>he's not hypothetical already happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 years ago.</v>

585
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't call it,</v>

586
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.483
<v Speaker 3>I won't call that nuclear terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was certainly a first piece of </v>

587
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.180
<v Speaker 3>dice semantics would be your primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern.</v>

588
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Nobody call that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how my teeth,</v>

589
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.503
<v Speaker 3>it's reasonable to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how the Japanese view it now and </v>

590
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 3>how the Japanese view their relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the United States.</v>

591
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

592
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an argument.</v>

593
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.293
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending narrative Sam that </v>

594
00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:17.814
<v Speaker 3>supersede the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power and narrative of nationalism and </v>

595
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.170
<v Speaker 3>geopolitics gift where there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they make sense,</v>

596
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.880
<v Speaker 3>determine it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make the,</v>

597
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.043
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Japan and the US no longer see </v>

598
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 3>themselves in a position or positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

599
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.441
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>

600
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.274
<v Speaker 3>so one question is how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to get all of these </v>

601
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Speaker 3>societies that are at loggerheads to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in Nonzero sum,</v>

602
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrangements with everyone else and um,</v>

603
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.023
<v Speaker 3>and what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we'll have to change to make that </v>

604
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my concern with religion,</v>

605
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 3>religious fundamentalism and not all </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions equally.</v>

606
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

607
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:02.030
<v Speaker 3>my concern is that these are the beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are held most closely.</v>

608
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>They're the least negotiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

609
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:06.250
<v Speaker 3>they're by definition non negotiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the,</v>

610
00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:07.084
<v Speaker 3>these are my faith based beliefs are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs that that if you challenge them </v>

611
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>that will buy whatever evidence or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever argument,</v>

612
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I will take that as a personal insult </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I will want,</v>

613
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.190
<v Speaker 3>want to resort immediately to violence </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the threat of violence.</v>

614
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.024
<v Speaker 3>I will want blasphemy laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to pass a law at the UN </v>

615
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will give you jail time.</v>

616
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.870
<v Speaker 3>If you say the wrong thing about my holy</v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

617
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.033
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where conversation has totally </v>

618
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 3>broken down and there's nothing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to resort to.</v>

619
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:36.150
<v Speaker 3>But for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say a suicide bomber,</v>

620
00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's an extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's difficult for us to understand.</v>

621
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm curious</v>

622
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.180
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam is the,</v>

623
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>what are the prerequisite conditions for</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombing even to be relevant.</v>

624
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And I also can't help but thinking when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of feel when,</v>

625
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.514
<v Speaker 1>when we sort of recall events like waco </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any disruption or anything that sort </v>

626
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 1>of ruptures the sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

627
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 1>American mainframe are not American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

628
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 1>this goes beyond nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put,</v>

629
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 1>if you find yourself in opposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

630
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.283
<v Speaker 1>the means by which the state will deploy</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence doesn't need to resort to sort </v>

631
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:10.180
<v Speaker 1>of Lurid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>livid,</v>

632
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 1>blatant clumsy acts like suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing.</v>

633
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:14.014
<v Speaker 1>Because the power is so evident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to exert power and control </v>

634
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.933
<v Speaker 1>is so total that it doesn't need sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost the sort of graphic and </v>

635
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.034
<v Speaker 1>horrific whimsy of something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombing all be underwritten by </v>

636
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:32.730
<v Speaker 1>something that looks peculiar to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like us that value life and value fine,</v>

637
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 1>don't have a belief system that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

638
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in some sort of a Valhalla </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently.</v>

639
00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.743
<v Speaker 3>Well you were using Waco is an example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of state oppression or suicidal </v>

640
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.100
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>

641
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm using it as an example of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

642
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

643
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of violence that interest me is</v>

644
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:53.820
<v Speaker 1>the violence of the truly powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kindness.</v>

645
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.820
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said like suicide,</v>

646
00:30:55.821 --> 00:31:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but I can see that it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gratuitous and sort of,</v>

647
00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and therefore an appealing form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me when,</v>

648
00:31:03.081 --> 00:31:03.914
<v Speaker 1>when analyzing nine 11 to focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetration of that event and the </v>

649
00:31:10.461 --> 00:31:11.294
<v Speaker 1>motivation of the individuals involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to the geopolitical </v>

650
00:31:15.051 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

651
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:17.443
<v Speaker 1>and what happens generally when two </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives come into conflict with one </v>

652
00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:24.590
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short changes us and means that we focus</v>

653
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:25.424
<v Speaker 1>like I'm my sole interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam is who he like when you talk about </v>

654
00:31:27.441 --> 00:31:32.120
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to get these 7 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to cooperate and form communities</v>

655
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.983
<v Speaker 1>based on mutual values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for some reason I believe is a </v>

656
00:31:35.511 --> 00:31:37.760
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own spirit,</v>

657
00:31:37.761 --> 00:31:38.594
<v Speaker 1>my own spiritual pursuits if led me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where I have a basic </v>

658
00:31:40.881 --> 00:31:41.714
<v Speaker 1>optimistic view of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own personal experience with Muslims </v>

659
00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:49.271
<v Speaker 1>is led me to believe that Islam is eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially a positive thing,</v>

660
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.953
<v Speaker 3>a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a bad way to take his </v>

661
00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 3>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at me cause how many Muslims have</v>

662
00:31:54.361 --> 00:31:56.880
<v Speaker 3>you had a personal experience with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted you,</v>

663
00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you're taking the temperature on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bicep bloody suicide bombers and no,</v>

664
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:00.061
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

665
00:32:00.061 --> 00:32:00.660
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

666
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.141
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

667
00:32:01.141 --> 00:32:01.974
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking the temperature on the basis </v>

668
00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:05.760
<v Speaker 3>of the actual doctrine that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this behavior.</v>

669
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.820
<v Speaker 3>And also aspects of the doctrine that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of the,</v>

670
00:32:08.821 --> 00:32:09.641
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no it's,</v>

671
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

672
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.670
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just,</v>

673
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.863
<v Speaker 3>I got to,</v>

674
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.703
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine that we'd have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation then there'd be a bit we </v>

675
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.110
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

676
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.280
<v Speaker 1>he sounds not that bad.</v>

677
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I think come into this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're thinking that,</v>

678
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.123
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth connecting with you have </v>

679
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:25.370
<v Speaker 3>these dots because it's not just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter of the killing of people.</v>

680
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about how people want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

681
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.900
<v Speaker 3>So if you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just a thought experiment,</v>

682
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.003
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ask yourself if you gave perfect </v>

683
00:32:33.891 --> 00:32:36.500
<v Speaker 3>power to any one group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

684
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.990
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they could impose their way of life,</v>

685
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 3>every other group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he gave him,</v>

686
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 3>this is my magic wand argument that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>use in my first book.</v>

687
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.211
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

688
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Give Dick Cheney a magic wand and Dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheney,</v>

689
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 3>the prototypical evil mustache twirling </v>
<v Speaker 3>bastard,</v>

690
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:52.060
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gave us the Iraq war and,</v>

691
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 3>and is as demonized on the left as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as anyone.</v>

692
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.800
<v Speaker 3>What would he have done if he had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

693
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to make a life in the Middle East </v>

694
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:02.200
<v Speaker 3>and Afghanistan</v>

695
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>any way he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need to.</v>

696
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.973
<v Speaker 2>We did not need to conjecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said we want to ever remove the </v>

697
00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 2>ability of our opponents to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the public sphere.</v>

698
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's go a little further.</v>

699
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

700
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.030
<v Speaker 3>let's go a little further in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

701
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Do you actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

702
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.720
<v Speaker 3>and maybe Dick Cheney has been so </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonized that he's the wrong case here,</v>

703
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.700
<v Speaker 3>but I have a strong opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Dick Cheney.</v>

704
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

705
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.800
<v Speaker 3>how you spell that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I would guess,</v>

707
00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:33.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone like Dick Cheney,</v>

708
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.810
<v Speaker 3>if given unlimited Ken unload just magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>the resources of magic magic,</v>

709
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.860
<v Speaker 3>you're doing like a two to narrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading of that,</v>

710
00:33:43.861 --> 00:33:44.251
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

711
00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:46.350
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to be a bit that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want these people to be able to</v>

712
00:33:46.351 --> 00:33:47.011
<v Speaker 3>attack us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

713
00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:48.600
<v Speaker 3>That's the goal of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

714
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppose our objectives,</v>

715
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's go.</v>

716
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 2>So what would we want that region for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickoff?</v>

717
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 2>We won't tell on challenged.</v>

718
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

719
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about magic.</v>

720
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 3>We don't even need to steal their </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>

721
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:06.194
<v Speaker 3>We have the power of magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what will life would you impose on </v>

722
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

723
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.790
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What life would would the worst of us in</v>

724
00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:15.050
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Dick Cheney impose on these people?</v>

725
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I think he'd make Afghanistan or Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Nebraska,</v>

726
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would not,</v>

727
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 3>he would not be some hell scape of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary suffering.</v>

728
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 3>It would be a starbucks on every corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mere capitalism.</v>

729
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Now you have your critique of this way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

730
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 3>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he would w what?</v>

731
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.880
<v Speaker 3>What he would want to impose on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is orderly economic,</v>

732
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 3>probably good Christian behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

733
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.233
<v Speaker 3>He would want movie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all be watching the Oscars right now </v>

734
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.433
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi impose </v>

735
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 3>on everyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's told us explicitly because he tried</v>

736
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:56.831
<v Speaker 3>the experiment in Syria and Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know exactly how he wants to live and</v>

737
00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:57.794
<v Speaker 3>he wants others to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is seventh century theocratic </v>

738
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 3>barbarism and there's no doubt about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

739
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.710
<v Speaker 3>It is fornicators homosexuals thrown </v>
<v Speaker 3>from rooftops and fornicators.</v>

740
00:35:07.711 --> 00:35:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

741
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.713
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's their throats slit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shortly we can agree on is that what </v>

742
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second guy name,</v>

743
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:17.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it relevant and broadly speaking,</v>

744
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:24.881
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant in terms of view of 7 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

745
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starbucks on every corner</v>

746
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.080
<v Speaker 3>there are 1.7</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion Muslims,</v>

747
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:37.250
<v Speaker 3>majority of which live under some </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant theocratic constraint.</v>

748
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 3>You're talking</v>

749
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 2>about women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same theocracy.</v>

750
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:42.804
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just as concerned about Christian </v>

751
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 2>theocracy as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you,</v>

752
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.140
<v Speaker 2>cause I think like you're about to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about sort of gender issues,</v>

753
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again it's free thought issues.</v>

754
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 2>It's shines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surely but,</v>

755
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the metric by which we evaluate them</v>

756
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:56.964
<v Speaker 2>is a distinct metric could drawn from </v>
<v Speaker 2>another narrative and the free and </v>

757
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 2>alfred like so like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might say,</v>

758
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 2>oh bloody hell women dressing live out </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

759
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it,</v>

760
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're in a position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make those kinds of decisions.</v>

761
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we are.</v>

762
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 2>You don't think you're in a position </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the,</v>

763
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 2>their narrative should adhere to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>template.</v>

764
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:12.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

765
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:13.524
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're a man,</v>

766
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you imagine that most women forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear a burqa.</v>

767
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about forced.</v>

768
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.203
<v Speaker 2>And my experience in conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that it's more that we ought to </v>

769
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:22.520
<v Speaker 2>regard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have,</v>

770
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I've asked Muslim women about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said to me,</v>

771
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:25.884
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a discipline and when we dig </v>

772
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:28.620
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>

773
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm talking about a burka.</v>

774
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:31.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about someone going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barnard who elects to wear a headscarf </v>

775
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 2>because she likes the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the imposition of a,</v>

776
00:36:40.141 --> 00:36:40.974
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our heterogeneous haitch demonic </v>

777
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 2>ideas of how masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine relationships work might not be</v>

778
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 2>universally applicable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something is universally applicable.</v>

779
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.560
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not universal,</v>

780
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.403
<v Speaker 3>we can understand those differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's a culture where they like </v>

781
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 3>spicy food and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

782
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.800
<v Speaker 3>but eating spicy food is just another </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to be happy as a,</v>

783
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an ape,</v>

784
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.753
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can understand those differences </v>

785
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:08.170
<v Speaker 3>biologically and culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

786
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.520
<v Speaker 3>the idea that it just may be as good as </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution for the,</v>

787
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:17.870
<v Speaker 3>the how to maximize human wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

788
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 3>to put half the population in bags from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment that and,</v>

789
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not let them learn to read.</v>

790
00:37:24.121 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking Afghanistan,</v>

791
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking the local case of Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the Taliban,</v>

792
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

793
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it may well fall back.</v>

794
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a Afghanistan currently as</v>

795
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:36.710
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about women who</v>

796
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.723
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have almost the worst possible life </v>

797
00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:41.290
<v Speaker 2>on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

798
00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:44.890
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about maternal mortality </v>
<v Speaker 2>rates that are off the charts.</v>

799
00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.630
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

800
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:47.943
<v Speaker 2>illiteracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is that you have to go back 200 </v>

801
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:50.704
<v Speaker 2>years in the west to find that level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>illiteracy reasoning that's used to </v>

802
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:57.970
<v Speaker 2>justify the bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not an actual colonization.</v>

803
00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.710
<v Speaker 2>If those territories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like us,</v>

804
00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:00.544
<v Speaker 2>they treat women different from us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think position to make those </v>

805
00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:04.294
<v Speaker 2>judgements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then tell me how you would react to </v>

806
00:38:05.861 --> 00:38:06.581
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have two.</v>

807
00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:07.414
<v Speaker 2>I have two daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I were thinking the way you were </v>

808
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:09.963
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I thought it would be a great </v>

809
00:38:12.101 --> 00:38:12.934
<v Speaker 2>idea to have a cultural exchange program</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I just sent my daughter's over to </v>

810
00:38:16.121 --> 00:38:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan to live with a Taliban </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

811
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:19.264
<v Speaker 2>So rather than go to summer school here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get prepared to go to an Ivy League </v>

812
00:38:22.061 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 2>college or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I send them to learn.</v>

813
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I send them to live with the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explained all this to be,</v>

814
00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

815
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 2>nobody but nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to answer it fully experiments.</v>

816
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:34.443
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from a Western culled up in </v>

817
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>indoctrinated</v>

818
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 1>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No right or wrong.</v>

819
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position.</v>

820
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Saying,</v>

821
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been born in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've grown up in the west.</v>

822
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.550
<v Speaker 1>My daughter's born in the West now </v>
<v Speaker 1>impose upon her a tilt,</v>

823
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:48.403
<v Speaker 1>totally different set of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the deep south over who </v>

824
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go to places in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't think it's unlucky to be born </v>
<v Speaker 3>a girl in Afghanistan five years ago.</v>

826
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.103
<v Speaker 1>I think that these kind of a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical tableaus are used to create </v>

827
00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:07.154
<v Speaker 1>a force hierarchy and a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority by a dominant culture that </v>

828
00:39:11.961 --> 00:39:16.961
<v Speaker 1>subsequently uses thinking of this of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this nature to underwrite the modern day</v>

829
00:39:19.011 --> 00:39:19.844
<v Speaker 1>colonization and subjugation of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on a massive scale as barbaric </v>

830
00:39:24.351 --> 00:39:25.184
<v Speaker 1>and a disgusting is nine 11 was a daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 11 since then so that that's a </v>

831
00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:30.734
<v Speaker 1>state system can perpetuate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>using rationalism using comfortable </v>

832
00:39:35.031 --> 00:39:40.031
<v Speaker 1>means of executions that glides slyly by</v>
<v Speaker 1>all why in the sky is no better than the</v>

833
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 1>nine 11 news over patterns too.</v>

834
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is better to let,</v>

835
00:39:45.901 --> 00:39:46.734
<v Speaker 3>we can talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're invoking a many things here </v>

836
00:39:49.171 --> 00:39:52.080
<v Speaker 3>which we should treat systematically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things like collateral damage.</v>

837
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 3>So you</v>

838
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you drop a bomb like that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a euphemism.</v>

839
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.343
<v Speaker 3>It's a euphemism but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the word we use to talk about </v>

840
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.710
<v Speaker 3>unintended people getting killed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

841
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:06.180
<v Speaker 1>What was it like when a 7% of drone </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures eight a result in a that day?</v>

842
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.350
<v Speaker 1>The data here are hard to get our hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>around as well.</v>

843
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Highly politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

844
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.060
<v Speaker 1>of course it is the then the language is</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

845
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:14.894
<v Speaker 1>And who decides what language is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who decides where powerful and who </v>

846
00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:20.690
<v Speaker 1>decides what's rational violence and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>decides what religion is even,</v>

847
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

848
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so let's,</v>

849
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 3>let's treat these things point by point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

850
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.260
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's take them in a giddy.</v>

851
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get out of the Blue</v>

852
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Giddy blur is now in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

853
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.153
<v Speaker 3>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fundamental claim that you </v>

854
00:40:36.141 --> 00:40:40.100
<v Speaker 3>have just made it at least implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I disagree with.</v>

855
00:40:40.101 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 3>And then I wrote my third book to rebut </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

856
00:40:42.031 --> 00:40:42.291
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

857
00:40:42.291 --> 00:40:43.124
<v Speaker 3>my third book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moral landscape is an argument that </v>

858
00:40:45.681 --> 00:40:46.514
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about questions of right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and good and evil in universal </v>

859
00:40:49.971 --> 00:40:50.804
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That these are not merely cultural or </v>

860
00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:56.240
<v Speaker 3>personal affectations right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that we're not free.</v>

861
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 1>You make it one of your full experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>minced in a minute.</v>

862
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

863
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because see you on the edge of the,</v>

864
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 1>we'll just have sex with her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The were say it's wrong.</v>

865
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.020
<v Speaker 3>The reason why thought experiments are </v>
<v Speaker 3>so useful is that there the,</v>

866
00:41:07.021 --> 00:41:08.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pure case,</v>

867
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.931
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

868
00:41:08.931 --> 00:41:10.010
<v Speaker 3>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just,</v>

869
00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:13.140
<v Speaker 3>you can take one variable at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

870
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.810
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

871
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.913
<v Speaker 3>but this idea that it's all a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal taste or all a matter of </v>

872
00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:22.310
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

873
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.650
<v Speaker 3>It suggests that all all cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore our,</v>

874
00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:27.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

875
00:41:27.971 --> 00:41:28.804
<v Speaker 3>the moment you make the link between </v>
<v Speaker 3>question of good and evil and the well </v>

876
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:32.794
<v Speaker 3>being of conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like questions of happiness and </v>

877
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:35.744
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

878
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think that link is very direct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

879
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 3>that's a separate conversation we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

880
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:39.434
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think the only intelligible </v>

881
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 3>morality has to focus on human </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>

882
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.134
<v Speaker 3>human wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even more broadly to the suffering </v>

883
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 3>of any conscious system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's animals.</v>

884
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.213
<v Speaker 3>If we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're torturing pigs so as to get </v>

885
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:53.130
<v Speaker 3>bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

886
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.660
<v Speaker 3>that is that we have an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation to not do that,</v>

887
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 3>do that last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find a better way of doing that.</v>

888
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.690
<v Speaker 3>So that is no longer torture breed pigs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't suffer,</v>

889
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.533
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what suffering should be our </v>

890
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:09.360
<v Speaker 3>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

891
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.440
<v Speaker 3>and so if the moment you grant that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to grant that not every culture and</v>

892
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 3>not every society and certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 3>every family,</v>

893
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has perfectly solved the human wellbeing</v>

894
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.833
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

895
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 3>They haven't solved at equally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you find a family over here that's</v>

896
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:30.000
<v Speaker 3>forcing their children to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement for 20 years and,</v>

897
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

898
00:42:31.031 --> 00:42:34.310
<v Speaker 3>to interbreed and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not showing them the light of day,</v>

899
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.480
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

900
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 3>this is a problem that society has an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in.</v>

901
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.243
<v Speaker 3>Now we're now we're now we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about power dynamics where the society </v>

902
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:43.214
<v Speaker 3>has an interest in rescue in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>children from their deranged and evil </v>

903
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:48.740
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right within this,</v>

904
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 3>just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could be true just in a single city</v>

905
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 3>like Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

906
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.030
<v Speaker 3>As has happened very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

907
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that scales that scales to whole nations</v>

908
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.160
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>

909
00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:00.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

910
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.960
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global situation.</v>

911
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Politically it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

912
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.753
<v Speaker 3>Politically complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for you to withhold judgment of the </v>

913
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:10.910
<v Speaker 3>burqa makes absolutely no sense for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to withhold judgment of</v>

914
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:14.070
<v Speaker 2>no female genital mutilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes absolutely no sense.</v>

915
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

916
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

917
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.700
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

918
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Perfect case of getting misled by words </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're,</v>

919
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.320
<v Speaker 3>they're highly non analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those two procedures.</v>

920
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:24.843
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in favor of male circumcision </v>

921
00:43:25.841 --> 00:43:26.674
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying just talk it to use </v>

922
00:43:27.911 --> 00:43:29.490
<v Speaker 3>the word mutilation or circumcision</v>

923
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.230
<v Speaker 2>synonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Word mutilation.</v>

924
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just jumped to the men though.</v>

925
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen when we sort of interchange </v>

926
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.943
<v Speaker 2>styles of dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still in the caddy blur by the </v>

927
00:43:39.191 --> 00:43:42.070
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never leave it and personal submission</v>

928
00:43:42.071 --> 00:43:42.904
<v Speaker 2>when we interchange that with sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of a subjugation of a family </v>

929
00:43:46.121 --> 00:43:47.530
<v Speaker 2>and keep people in the cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

930
00:43:47.531 --> 00:43:49.450
<v Speaker 2>there's different levels of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'd like to,</v>

931
00:43:49.451 --> 00:43:50.284
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I may shift gears a little sad </v>

932
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:52.274
<v Speaker 2>because one of my great interest in you </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your immense intellectual capacity </v>

933
00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:56.854
<v Speaker 2>and jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

934
00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:57.723
<v Speaker 2>what I want to call it without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberately provocative zeal and love </v>

935
00:44:02.561 --> 00:44:03.394
<v Speaker 2>of ethics and morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would like to know how that </v>

936
00:44:05.981 --> 00:44:10.570
<v Speaker 2>relates to your personal spiritual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you are a great meditator.</v>

937
00:44:10.571 --> 00:44:11.141
<v Speaker 2>You said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

938
00:44:11.141 --> 00:44:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I've never had there Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years silence.</v>

939
00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:14.590
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd struggled for 25.</v>

940
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:14.921
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

941
00:44:14.921 --> 00:44:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I meditate twice a day for 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't find this right,</v>

942
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:17.890
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

943
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:18.723
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me this stuff is the answer </v>

944
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.720
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the reason I meditate,</v>

945
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:23.583
<v Speaker 2>the reason that I embrace the spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is because I believe I've </v>

946
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.353
<v Speaker 2>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced that for me personally </v>

947
00:44:30.311 --> 00:44:31.144
<v Speaker 2>to become a valuable of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever that song on the microlevel of </v>

948
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.000
<v Speaker 2>my family and hopefully on a broader </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

949
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.463
<v Speaker 2>I have to take personal responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the fact that I'm a complex </v>

950
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:40.704
<v Speaker 2>individual that are within me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the things I would condemn over </v>

951
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 2>the course of a podcast talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant man like yourself.</v>

952
00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.143
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one minute I'll condemn violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>another minute I'll come down condemn </v>

953
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 2>egotism and self centeredness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The I am victim to all of these.</v>

954
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm perpetrator of self centeredness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>egocentrism and the tool that has helped</v>

955
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 2>me most to overcome these personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

956
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.353
<v Speaker 2>There's been a kind of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>veltin Shang and I planned to use that </v>

957
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 2>word with you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My German's bad.</v>

958
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.983
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's literally the only German word </v>

959
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll hear cause it's the only one I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

960
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.473
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say my spirituality has been my </v>

961
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:17.670
<v Speaker 2>personal vehicle for carrying me away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from sort of selfishness,</v>

962
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:18.504
<v Speaker 2>self destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like I'm talking as a peasant's </v>

963
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:20.600
<v Speaker 2>overcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

964
00:45:20.601 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

965
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 2>through the help of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to a degree,</v>

966
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 2>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must say to a huge degree faith,</v>

967
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own addiction.</v>

968
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got a addiction issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't you?</v>

969
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Habitation you just for you dabbling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

970
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Was your brother know like Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

971
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 2>neither.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got no addiction background.</v>

972
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

973
00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Dan Harris had Dan Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

974
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 2>who's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a friend.</v>

975
00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:46.290
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no relation,</v>

976
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 2>but he wrote the book 10% happier and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a big bestseller about mindfulness.</v>

977
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>And so he's had issues that he's talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

978
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

979
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 2>so forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my person,</v>

980
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.883
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my personal experiences have been </v>

981
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:04.431
<v Speaker 2>that sort of spirituality and a faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is determined resolutely by as best</v>

982
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:08.550
<v Speaker 2>as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonjudgmental realism,</v>

983
00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 2>a benevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kindness,</v>

984
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.143
<v Speaker 2>being of service to others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>principles that broadly speaking don't </v>

985
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 2>require me to enter into conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be off service.</v>

986
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

987
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.833
<v Speaker 2>this for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is an incredibly valuable </v>

988
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:24.084
<v Speaker 2>resource.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

989
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.983
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these things and ethics in general </v>

990
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 2>are drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll not ultimately,</v>

991
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:31.890
<v Speaker 2>because prior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what proceeded religion,</v>

992
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:32.724
<v Speaker 2>some form of theater and ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what they're doing down deep </v>

993
00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:36.384
<v Speaker 2>in the dank of the forests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what gods they device there were </v>

994
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.590
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

995
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:42.870
<v Speaker 2>precisely where consciousness is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more open.</v>

996
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I suppose what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to understand it.</v>

997
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:45.624
<v Speaker 2>So it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does your personal spirituality </v>

998
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.490
<v Speaker 2>serve you ethically and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

999
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>where does that intersect with beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance?</v>

1000
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Because tolerance suggests that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to tolerate.</v>

1001
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Where does it lead you to a compassion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and love?</v>

1002
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:00.563
<v Speaker 2>And what solutions do you think can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>derived from your personal understood </v>

1003
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>your present experiences of mysticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spirituality?</v>

1004
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Where I would say first that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>

1005
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 2>while it may seem different from what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been just talking about,</v>

1006
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>it's of a piece with what we've just </v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about.</v>

1007
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:16.314
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why I have such passion </v>
<v Speaker 2>for criticizing this particular species </v>

1008
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:20.424
<v Speaker 2>of bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious ones is because I see the </v>

1009
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 2>baby and the bath water that everyone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of losing.</v>

1010
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 2>And I see that it doesn't require any </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit</v>

1011
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 3>too to be saved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1012
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:32.884
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to lie to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to believe that a book </v>

1013
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 3>was written by the creator of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1014
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.443
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to believe that that hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire weights people who don't call </v>

1015
00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:40.913
<v Speaker 3>historical person by the right name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to believe any of those </v>

1016
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:43.984
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of those things are absolutely </v>

1017
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 3>integral to the doctrines of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>

1018
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:49.083
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's many separate religions on </v>

1019
00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:51.570
<v Speaker 3>off</v>

1020
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:52.403
<v Speaker 2>for that are incompatible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a point where religion </v>

1021
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and politics intersect and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>always clear where that line is drawn.</v>

1022
00:47:57.631 --> 00:48:01.410
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirituality stops being about kindness,</v>

1023
00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.071
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

1024
00:48:02.071 --> 00:48:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Remember earlier in this podcast you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the list if the things that difficult to</v>

1025
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:07.080
<v Speaker 2>quantify scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would wonder how,</v>

1026
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1027
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:08.524
<v Speaker 2>how a valuable and a useful those image </v>
<v Speaker 2>scans and neuro image scans are when </v>

1028
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.710
<v Speaker 2>dealing with fun and love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they have great service,</v>

1029
00:48:16.711 --> 00:48:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like these things,</v>

1030
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.040
<v Speaker 2>the way that we access them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that we increase them.</v>

1031
00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to your earlier point,</v>

1032
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>the way that we as best as possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate suffering.</v>

1033
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.853
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the function and the role of </v>

1034
00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:31.710
<v Speaker 2>spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1035
00:48:31.711 --> 00:48:32.544
<v Speaker 2>and I think sort of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>furniture and ornamentation that </v>

1036
00:48:34.321 --> 00:48:35.154
<v Speaker 2>religions are variously acquired due to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cultural influx infections of the </v>

1037
00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:41.640
<v Speaker 2>times in which they were conceived for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me are less important and less relevant.</v>

1038
00:48:41.641 --> 00:48:42.474
<v Speaker 2>Whilst I acknowledge that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unique case and some of the </v>

1039
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:46.080
<v Speaker 2>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1040
00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:48.460
<v Speaker 2>issues that you're addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1041
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.033
<v Speaker 2>I've been not imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that what you're saying is true </v>

1043
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.313
<v Speaker 2>and there's baby bath water issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in the baby always on </v>

1044
00:48:56.551 --> 00:48:57.384
<v Speaker 2>about a bath.</v>

1045
00:48:58.930 --> 00:48:59.763
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you just described about your </v>

1046
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:04.760
<v Speaker 3>own spiritual life and ethical life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1047
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.010
<v Speaker 3>it is obvious to me that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal principles there that what you</v>

1048
00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:12.370
<v Speaker 3>just described about the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to certain things.</v>

1049
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so meditation,</v>

1050
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1051
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 3>getting off certain substances that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>not good for you.</v>

1052
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:19.204
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1053
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 3>breaking with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with addiction,</v>

1054
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.430
<v Speaker 3>these are universal features of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like to have a human mind that is,</v>

1055
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:33.340
<v Speaker 3>is based on human neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1056
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1057
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.810
<v Speaker 3>this is not something we just made up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that's,</v>

1058
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a purely a product of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not merely cultural.</v>

1059
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.233
<v Speaker 3>And that's why sticking girls in bags </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their entire lives and not letting </v>

1060
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:48.094
<v Speaker 3>them read</v>

1061
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:51.270
<v Speaker 2>bad derisory it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what,</v>

1062
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.490
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what happened</v>

1063
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.420
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Afghanistan.</v>

1064
00:49:53.421 --> 00:49:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about,</v>

1065
00:49:54.261 --> 00:49:56.180
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about the voluntary.</v>

1066
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you use a century language if you</v>

1067
00:49:58.961 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 2>are here to convey love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly,</v>

1068
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:02.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like no because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1069
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:03.784
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

1070
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.990
<v Speaker 3>pretend to love girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not as concerned as I am about</v>

1071
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.490
<v Speaker 3>this ms treatment of them.</v>

1072
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't pretend to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should.</v>

1073
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not for girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're girls and the Americans.</v>

1074
00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you're overthinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're overthinking.</v>

1075
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with skin color </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what the level of thought.</v>

1076
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 2>That's [inaudible] Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you like,</v>

1077
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all in American,</v>

1078
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I can introduce you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take a few facts on board here.</v>

1079
00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I can introduce you to women who have of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1080
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever shade of Brown skin,</v>

1081
00:50:40.661 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you require my requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who holds about me,</v>

1082
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.523
<v Speaker 3>who have grown up in these cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who will say exactly what I'm saying </v>

1083
00:50:48.611 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 3>about the consequences of compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling.</v>

1084
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.650
<v Speaker 3>No country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1085
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.030
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1086
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1087
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but no subjugation is the same in yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>or exercise.</v>

1088
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.310
<v Speaker 3>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1089
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.360
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're drawing the wrong lesson here.</v>

1090
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm back.</v>

1091
00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.121
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1092
00:51:07.121 --> 00:51:08.500
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're just missing a few facts.</v>

1093
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.680
<v Speaker 3>If you have those two people have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

1094
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:12.543
<v Speaker 3>If you take someone like I on her cle or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Haider who runs the ex Muslims of </v>

1095
00:51:17.081 --> 00:51:18.040
<v Speaker 3>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1096
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.760
<v Speaker 3>And you have her talk to someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Linda Sarsour,</v>

1097
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.980
<v Speaker 3>you know the Hijabi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1098
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.750
<v Speaker 3>icon of the woman's March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1099
00:51:25.751 --> 00:51:26.584
<v Speaker 3>Darlene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the left now who's actually a closet </v>

1100
00:51:28.061 --> 00:51:31.750
<v Speaker 3>theocrat and quite an nefarious person </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get her talking about religion,</v>

1101
00:51:31.751 --> 00:51:34.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean she will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she will not admit that life for,</v>

1102
00:51:34.121 --> 00:51:38.680
<v Speaker 3>for women in Saudi Arabia is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is bad by comparison at all for,</v>

1103
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:39.514
<v Speaker 3>with life for women in the West having </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a complicit trades relationships </v>

1104
00:51:43.031 --> 00:51:46.150
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll agree with you there.</v>

1105
00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.610
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you have two women have this sort</v>

1106
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1107
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.523
<v Speaker 3>One Who has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has taken off the hijab for reasons </v>

1108
00:51:52.721 --> 00:51:56.590
<v Speaker 3>of not wanting to wear it and wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in a system where she's free not to</v>

1109
00:51:56.591 --> 00:51:58.150
<v Speaker 3>wear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one who says,</v>

1110
00:51:58.151 --> 00:51:58.984
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing it purely as an expression </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my own religious faith and it's just </v>

1111
00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:07.411
<v Speaker 3>pure women empower female empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you let that conversation proceed,</v>

1112
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:13.140
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that this side has to lie </v>
<v Speaker 3>endlessly about the,</v>

1113
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:16.210
<v Speaker 3>the actual doctrines about why most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1114
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:18.490
<v Speaker 3>most women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time are wearing this there.</v>

1115
00:52:18.491 --> 00:52:21.160
<v Speaker 3>It's being forced upon them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe we'll talk about the misuse of</v>

1116
00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:24.220
<v Speaker 3>power you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about mean to take,</v>

1117
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.113
<v Speaker 3>take the perfect case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it's a thought </v>

1118
00:52:26.531 --> 00:52:27.970
<v Speaker 3>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually happened.</v>

1119
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.103
<v Speaker 3>You take the religious police in Mecca </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wouldn't let the girls who are </v>

1120
00:52:33.071 --> 00:52:36.760
<v Speaker 3>burning alive in a dormitory be rescued </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't wearing their,</v>

1121
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.020
<v Speaker 3>their veils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1122
00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:38.854
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't let the firemen go in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescue girls from a burning building </v>

1123
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't properly vale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1124
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.780
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reductio ad absurdum this</v>

1125
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.470
<v Speaker 1>gender relationships in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>have become so complex,</v>

1126
00:52:49.471 --> 00:52:50.304
<v Speaker 1>particularly where we're both fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can judge the sure and the </v>

1127
00:52:56.161 --> 00:53:01.050
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic obligations that will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed upon my dor to look a certain way</v>

1128
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.610
<v Speaker 1>to behave a certain way to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1129
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:04.563
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think that's a reasonable </v>

1130
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:06.244
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think you are in a position to </v>

1131
00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:11.280
<v Speaker 3>judge how wrong that would be and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone is used to judge how wrong,</v>

1132
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.050
<v Speaker 3>what would be imposing those </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrictions on your girls?</v>

1133
00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a bad,</v>

1134
00:53:16.241 --> 00:53:19.540
<v Speaker 3>a diminishment of the wellbeing of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls and to pretend to not know what if</v>

1135
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:20.374
<v Speaker 3>a girl in Afghanistan</v>

1136
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.493
<v Speaker 1>turning to this fish is in my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you not more concerned that by </v>

1137
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the continual objectification</v>

1138
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:31.700
<v Speaker 2>of women over that female sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advertising industry using females,</v>

1139
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a different order of problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm totally with you,</v>

1140
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.613
<v Speaker 2>but we just want these more prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is more likely to </v>

1141
00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:40.464
<v Speaker 2>happen to your daughter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That she's going to be whisked off to </v>

1142
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been wife number five or that she's</v>

1143
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:47.780
<v Speaker 2>going to have sex with some days because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got that here.</v>

1144
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 2>My concern is for both things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consensually for reality,</v>

1145
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:53.803
<v Speaker 2>like an abstract ideas that play into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of an already a power dynamic </v>

1146
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:03.300
<v Speaker 2>and a well-served power dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get who's side are we all?</v>

1147
00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:05.870
<v Speaker 2>But let's get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does the grail serves I have,</v>

1148
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 2>where is this mythic truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does perennialism come from?</v>

1149
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Why are these themes found throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great faiths,</v>

1150
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.720
<v Speaker 2>the oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unity,</v>

1151
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:18.950
<v Speaker 2>the possibilities for love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going Giddy Sam,</v>

1152
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.990
<v Speaker 2>we go for another ride in the tumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>dryer of love.</v>

1153
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:23.483
<v Speaker 3>So let me try to connect a few of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things because you're concerned about </v>

1154
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.670
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1155
00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 3>And you're concerned about the misuse of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our power.</v>

1156
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 3>We're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so our being Western power say</v>

1157
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:35.923
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to tell the truth like now I've got </v>

1158
00:54:37.581 --> 00:54:38.260
<v Speaker 2>ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1159
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that those,</v>

1160
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.940
<v Speaker 2>that mosque of nationalism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>superficial.</v>

1161
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Let the real power operates and has done</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably since British colonialism on an</v>

1162
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.633
<v Speaker 2>economic scale that doesn't pay a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal of attention to sort of trade </v>

1163
00:54:53.361 --> 00:54:54.194
<v Speaker 2>tariffs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those very trade terrace have we </v>

1164
00:54:54.981 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 2>drawn up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1165
00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:59.870
<v Speaker 2>we've the powerful in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what for me,</v>

1166
00:54:59.871 --> 00:55:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what interests me and not sort of like,</v>

1167
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.111
<v Speaker 2>while I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:55:03.111 --> 00:55:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm got no argument bloody isis when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read about that southern kingdom,</v>

1169
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:06.843
<v Speaker 2>some terrifying shit going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what interests me more is who is it </v>

1170
00:55:10.971 --> 00:55:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that gets to determine what is happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world in my life right now?</v>

1171
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.633
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's transnational corporations </v>

1172
00:55:19.041 --> 00:55:22.280
<v Speaker 2>and governments of Western democracies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't need to resort to the kind of</v>

1173
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:23.263
<v Speaker 2>a sort of vivid acts of violence on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their domestic population because it's </v>

1174
00:55:26.331 --> 00:55:27.164
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary because we've all been </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautifully conditioned and when it is </v>

1175
00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:32.660
<v Speaker 2>required,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when brutality and violence is required,</v>

1176
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.510
<v Speaker 2>it will be used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is enacted.</v>

1177
00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And that when me seems more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>than people responding to that power,</v>

1178
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:42.044
<v Speaker 2>but it's all important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then why is your focus continually </v>

1179
00:55:44.331 --> 00:55:46.850
<v Speaker 2>on this sort of fetishized aspect?</v>

1180
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1181
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.120
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's again,</v>

1182
00:55:49.121 --> 00:55:53.760
<v Speaker 3>it was just to say fetishized is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to reveal the problem that I,</v>

1183
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:58.480
<v Speaker 3>that that causes me to focus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>

1184
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:02.620
<v Speaker 3>it comes back to the power of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the worst ideas going</v>

1185
00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:04.630
<v Speaker 3>really is the one that you've expressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1186
00:56:04.631 --> 00:56:05.464
<v Speaker 3>which is who am I to judge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a white guy who grew up in a </v>

1187
00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.940
<v Speaker 3>western context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who am I to judge the Burka,</v>

1188
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.220
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of moral relativism,</v>

1189
00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:14.440
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1190
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:14.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>

1191
00:56:14.891 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 3>That'd be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1192
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:16.780
<v Speaker 3>this is the order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1193
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't wanna answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>

1194
00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:22.300
<v Speaker 3>but this is the intellectual trend that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave us this kind of,</v>

1195
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apprehension around making these </v>

1196
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 3>judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1197
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Who am I to to say what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good life for somebody else?</v>

1198
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how</v>

1199
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.780
<v Speaker 2>grotesque the example of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

1200
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.970
<v Speaker 2>nonviolence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion and love is the answer,</v>

1201
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm what I think where we disagree is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what should be the key target.</v>

1202
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 2>What is generating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generating the problems.</v>

1203
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.400
<v Speaker 3>There are many problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think to take it at the level of,</v>

1204
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:54.623
<v Speaker 3>of greatest abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think greatest leverage for us to </v>

1205
00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:02.490
<v Speaker 3>think about it is for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1206
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.910
<v Speaker 3>this is not a problem of the world being</v>
<v Speaker 3>filled with bad people,</v>

1207
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some bad people.</v>

1208
00:57:07.471 --> 00:57:08.304
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will say 1% of people in every </v>

1209
00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 3>culture are probably psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1210
00:57:11.551 --> 00:57:12.384
<v Speaker 3>So there's 1% of people who really do </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel no compunction about harming other </v>

1211
00:57:16.111 --> 00:57:16.944
<v Speaker 3>people and they kind of get off on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to keep doing it no </v>

1212
00:57:18.811 --> 00:57:21.270
<v Speaker 3>matter what you change about the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1213
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:25.980
<v Speaker 3>but most harm is the result of bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

1214
00:57:25.981 --> 00:57:26.814
<v Speaker 3>good people having bad ideas and good </v>
<v Speaker 3>people being in systems where there are </v>

1215
00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:33.230
<v Speaker 3>bad incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I think we,</v>

1216
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.030
<v Speaker 3>so the crucial word here is incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1217
00:57:36.031 --> 00:57:36.864
<v Speaker 3>I think we need economic systems and </v>
<v Speaker 3>political systems and institutions and </v>

1218
00:57:41.881 --> 00:57:45.120
<v Speaker 3>interpret and ways of being with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another publicly,</v>

1219
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which align our incentives in such a way</v>

1220
00:57:49.351 --> 00:57:53.970
<v Speaker 3>so as to make ordinary mediocre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so insightful,</v>

1221
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:56.550
<v Speaker 3>not so reflective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so philosophical.</v>

1222
00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:01.140
<v Speaker 3>And frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even that ethical people effort more</v>

1223
00:58:01.141 --> 00:58:02.940
<v Speaker 3>and more effortlessly do the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1224
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:03.401
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

1225
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:06.420
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't have to be Saint Francis </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Assisi to,</v>

1226
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.580
<v Speaker 3>to act well in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1227
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.593
<v Speaker 3>But there are systems where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentives are bad enough that you </v>

1228
00:58:13.111 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 3>really have to be a moral hero to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>just basically decent.</v>

1229
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.053
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the incentives are pointing the </v>

1230
00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:19.680
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1231
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you an example for this.</v>

1232
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life in a maximum security prison.</v>

1233
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:26.550
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a good guy,</v>

1234
00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you're not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a Jew.</v>

1235
00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:29.640
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want to get along with people.</v>

1236
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.490
<v Speaker 3>If you were put into a maximum security </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>

1237
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:35.400
<v Speaker 3>all the incentives would be pushing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other way.</v>

1238
00:58:35.401 --> 00:58:36.234
<v Speaker 3>So for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you not to join a white gang in a </v>

1239
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:43.440
<v Speaker 3>maximum security prison would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively suicidal.</v>

1240
00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:44.274
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would just be the victim of </v>

1241
00:58:45.331 --> 00:58:50.331
<v Speaker 3>everyone so that the place is set up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>segregate everyone by skin color,</v>

1242
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.233
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if you don't have a racist bone </v>

1243
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:53.154
<v Speaker 3>in your body,</v>

1244
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:58.650
<v Speaker 2>you're just self preservation alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also concentrated society.</v>

1245
00:58:59.921 --> 00:59:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The royal institution.</v>

1246
00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.400
<v Speaker 2>But it's the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a perfect example of bad incentives</v>

1247
00:59:05.401 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 2>are misaligned incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how these things happen.</v>

1248
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.680
<v Speaker 2>They're happening everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of these,</v>

1249
00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 2>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of these exams,</v>

1250
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.480
<v Speaker 3>samples of bad incentives are most that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of these examples of where power is</v>

1251
00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:20.383
<v Speaker 3>victimizing millions and of people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would argue examples where the system </v>

1252
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:30.791
<v Speaker 3>is set up in such a way that it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>reliably x sporting this misery.</v>

1253
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

1254
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.733
<v Speaker 3>there is no author of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no bad person or they're very </v>

1255
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 3>few bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are the actual authors of this,</v>

1256
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.173
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this human suffering there or the </v>

1257
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:45.530
<v Speaker 3>perpetrators of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It what we have.</v>

1258
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Our systems were selfish people being </v>
<v Speaker 3>selfish most of the time.</v>

1259
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Managed to export a fair amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>misery to tell people who are less lucky</v>

1260
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:56.840
<v Speaker 3>than themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we want to,</v>

1261
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 3>if we want a fairer economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrangement,</v>

1262
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 3>we have to design it and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>design it for people as they are.</v>

1263
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.310
<v Speaker 3>We have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need systems that will allow,</v>

1264
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.240
<v Speaker 2>how about people are mutable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1265
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.273
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that we respond to ideas and we </v>

1266
01:00:12.061 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 2>respond to incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1267
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.010
<v Speaker 2>And incentives to be a bit more personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a moment.</v>

1268
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.013
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you a bit cynical about human </v>

1269
01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.730
<v Speaker 2>beings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like when we talk it's like I feel</v>

1270
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.360
<v Speaker 2>we've been fighting about terrorism and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1271
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:29.063
<v Speaker 2>female gentlemen genital mutilation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pro terrorism protein mutilation </v>

1272
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.160
<v Speaker 2>starts on those issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1273
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:39.240
<v Speaker 2>shoulder to the wall now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you seem so very,</v>

1274
01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you seem like angry about you seem angry</v>
<v Speaker 2>and about humanity.</v>

1275
01:00:45.871 --> 01:00:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Almost all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think human beings are not good</v>

1276
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:50.730
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

1277
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Well they're neither,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>

1278
01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.330
<v Speaker 3>it's all mixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1279
01:00:54.331 --> 01:00:57.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were good and were bad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're careless.</v>

1280
01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:58.323
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're short side the line between </v>

1281
01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:00.730
<v Speaker 2>good and evil runs through.</v>

1282
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1283
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:03.550
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly a more eloquent way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it,</v>

1284
01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:04.840
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

1285
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 3>but there's</v>

1286
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.010
<v Speaker 4>okay</v>

1287
01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:08.661
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1288
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 3>to talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1289
01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:11.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situational problem,</v>

1290
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.063
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1291
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1292
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:19.550
<v Speaker 3>The problem of incentives is doing more </v>
<v Speaker 3>work than human evil is doing.</v>

1293
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1294
01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:22.270
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we,</v>

1295
01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:23.423
<v Speaker 3>all of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have work to do on ourselves to be </v>

1296
01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:27.600
<v Speaker 3>happier and better people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1297
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.000
<v Speaker 3>And that is spiritual life and that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethical life.</v>

1298
01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:32.850
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think better than,</v>

1299
01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:33.720
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are not,</v>

1300
01:01:33.721 --> 01:01:35.430
<v Speaker 3>these are not mutually exclusive </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects.</v>

1301
01:01:35.431 --> 01:01:36.264
<v Speaker 3>These can be done simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but better than each of us figuring out </v>

1302
01:01:39.631 --> 01:01:41.430
<v Speaker 3>how to be a saint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1303
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.713
<v Speaker 3>would be to design a system that made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier for everyone to be far better </v>

1304
01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.420
<v Speaker 3>than they're tending to be now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's possible.</v>

1305
01:01:48.421 --> 01:01:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally</v>

1306
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>possible to a lot of decentralization </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the significant change,</v>

1307
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>particularly in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our nations around what is called the</v>

1308
01:01:58.431 --> 01:01:59.264
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I sort of see as the religious now </v>

1309
01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something again.</v>

1310
01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:05.090
<v Speaker 2>It's again a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I want to say?</v>

1311
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So personal.</v>

1312
01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I A,</v>

1313
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>the other day I was driving home from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen the movie or something.</v>

1314
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:12.434
<v Speaker 2>It was a daytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still a homeless guy just collapsed </v>

1315
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 2>laying in the middle of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:20.360
<v Speaker 2>it's La homeless people just everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>forming shanty</v>

1317
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>towns like the apocalypse is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and is creeping in around us.</v>

1318
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it's slow tide and it was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless guy and like,</v>

1319
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.793
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that homeless guy is just laying </v>

1320
01:02:29.971 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should do something about that.</v>

1321
01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Amanda didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went home and I thought like,</v>

1322
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I do anything about that?</v>

1323
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Great example here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1324
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:40.913
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because in the current system </v>

1325
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing very easy to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1326
01:02:47.091 --> 01:02:50.180
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to be an absolute moral hero</v>

1327
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:53.990
<v Speaker 3>to do something about that particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless guy.</v>

1328
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:55.243
<v Speaker 3>And it's very likely that what you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>do wouldn't help a lot and would just </v>

1329
01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:03.200
<v Speaker 3>complicate your life massively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you just say,</v>

1330
01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:04.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is totally untenable.</v>

1331
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:07.250
<v Speaker 3>I cannot step over the body of yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>another homeless person.</v>

1332
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.533
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take this guy into my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to come back to my hotel </v>

1333
01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:11.240
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>

1334
01:03:11.241 --> 01:03:11.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1335
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:12.663
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go to London in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to figure out what to do with </v>

1336
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.970
<v Speaker 3>this guy and get him in and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be your whole project</v>

1337
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>then a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1338
01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.310
<v Speaker 1>it's complex.</v>

1339
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called [inaudible].</v>

1340
01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.200
<v Speaker 3>So the reason why he's lying on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1341
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.213
<v Speaker 3>there are many reasons why he's lying on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sidewalk and probably those reasons </v>

1342
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:29.150
<v Speaker 3>aren't immediately actionable by you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1343
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.713
<v Speaker 3>now what we need is a system that </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizes the problem of homelessness </v>

1344
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 3>in the most compassionate and pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>way and figures out what,</v>

1345
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever solution there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1346
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's substance abuse issues,</v>

1347
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>there's mental health issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1348
01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.610
<v Speaker 3>there's zoning issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>

1349
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:47.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1350
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:50.130
<v Speaker 3>we the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this not in my backyard ism that</v>

1351
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:50.964
<v Speaker 3>where people are just getting pushed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>different parts of the city because you </v>

1352
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:55.680
<v Speaker 3>don't see this in Beverly Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see this in Santa Monica,</v>

1353
01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to figure out a solution that is</v>

1354
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>compassionate and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1355
01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>so do you think poverty is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relegation of spiritual principles?</v>

1356
01:04:03.821 --> 01:04:04.654
<v Speaker 1>The fact that broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally spiritual principles and for </v>

1357
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>been relegated to the point of almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>insignificant.</v>

1358
01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:09.394
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of no longer feels like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a person or ge to help homeless </v>

1359
01:04:12.881 --> 01:04:13.714
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course as you set the systems aren't </v>

1360
01:04:14.801 --> 01:04:15.634
<v Speaker 1>in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One wonders what would happen if I just </v>

1361
01:04:16.581 --> 01:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of put him over my shoulder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to take him somewhere.</v>

1362
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I know it happened shelters would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>full complex medical issues,</v>

1363
01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.673
<v Speaker 1>issues of finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you think there's sort of this </v>

1364
01:04:25.931 --> 01:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>sort of idea of individual ism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual freedom kind of relieved,</v>

1365
01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>still sort of be somehow favors primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and selfish drives over sort of communal</v>

1366
01:04:34.481 --> 01:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>fraternal drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whilst I agree with you on that baby</v>

1367
01:04:37.061 --> 01:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>bath water dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we do enough to,</v>

1368
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to focus on,</v>

1369
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luminate and present the baby,</v>

1370
01:04:46.901 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>the baby that is spirituality.</v>

1371
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to kind of things that we're,</v>

1372
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're meditating for two years in </v>

1373
01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:52.294
<v Speaker 1>silence and when you're continuing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate now probably when you're doing </v>

1374
01:04:54.011 --> 01:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrong senses or fraternity,</v>

1375
01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:57.600
<v Speaker 1>togetherness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oneness.</v>

1376
01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1377
01:04:59.351 --> 01:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priority,</v>

1378
01:05:01.601 --> 01:05:02.434
<v Speaker 1>the most useful way of getting those </v>
<v Speaker 1>values into our culture is to </v>

1379
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate them to confront power where</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and necessary.</v>

1380
01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me less significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what I'm fascinated by,</v>

1381
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the to attack focus on the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have focusing on and</v>

1382
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.963
<v Speaker 2>arguments you've been brilliantly making</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pricing about sort of we sort of </v>

1383
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:21.994
<v Speaker 2>sort of wonderfully pos or disagree is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has become evident on many of the </v>

1384
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 2>tenets of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that for me they,</v>

1385
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>well I suppose what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

1386
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:30.950
<v Speaker 2>and people like you and I who believe in</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirituality,</v>

1387
01:05:30.951 --> 01:05:31.784
<v Speaker 2>you believe in compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We believe in love be doing more to </v>

1388
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:35.943
<v Speaker 2>elevate those values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that a lot when I talk about </v>

1389
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>meditation and spirituality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wellbeing and ethics a lot is it got the</v>

1390
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 2>highest base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Behavioral.</v>

1391
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I know you have to be a chairman of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with you know,</v>

1392
01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:53.090
<v Speaker 2>secularism and all that kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of be like,</v>

1393
01:05:53.091 --> 01:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that convert into,</v>

1394
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought a boots on the ground,</v>

1395
01:05:57.341 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 2>love for other humans?</v>

1396
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Well we do talk about what the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth is here,</v>

1397
01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:07.254
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have consciousness and its contents </v>

1398
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 3>in each moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1399
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.730
<v Speaker 3>that's what our lives are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>

1400
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:13.923
<v Speaker 3>we have changing states of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is all there is to care about </v>

1401
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.020
<v Speaker 3>is that all there is to care about our </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes for good or for ill in conscious</v>

1402
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 3>creatures like ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you love someone,</v>

1403
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 3>you care that they be happy and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they no longer suffer or if they suffer,</v>

1404
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.473
<v Speaker 3>they suffer in ways that are productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that lead to an even deeper states of </v>

1405
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we're just pure hedonists.</v>

1406
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.553
<v Speaker 3>There's this kinds of suffering that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lead lead that has a silver lining </v>

1407
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:41.643
<v Speaker 3>that gets us somewhere worth going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're talking about finding </v>

1408
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 3>meaning in life and making meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in community,</v>

1409
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:50.920
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about just what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to be you.</v>

1410
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>

1411
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.363
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually know a lot about how to </v>

1412
01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.713
<v Speaker 3>improve states of human consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and creativity and aesthetic beauty and </v>

1413
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:06.064
<v Speaker 3>ethical interactions and not lying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating people the way you would want </v>

1414
01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>to be treated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like a precept,</v>

1415
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 3>like the golden rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super useful.</v>

1416
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.760
<v Speaker 3>And as I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great,</v>

1417
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:15.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1418
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.900
<v Speaker 2>PC software under the heading of baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1419
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.250
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is okay.</v>

1420
01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:21.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't,</v>

1421
01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:22.554
<v Speaker 3>but they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't only come from scripture and </v>

1422
01:07:23.701 --> 01:07:26.520
<v Speaker 3>there people had these ideas outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious traditions.</v>

1423
01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:28.580
<v Speaker 3>You can find Greek philosophers who've </v>
<v Speaker 3>said all this,</v>

1424
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1425
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:31.020
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1426
01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.190
<v Speaker 2>but nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing has,</v>

1427
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.510
<v Speaker 2>nothing has to be believed on </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient evidence to use these ideas</v>

1428
01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.750
<v Speaker 2>and to find them compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1429
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.593
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I agree with you or you don't </v>

1430
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:41.454
<v Speaker 2>have to all I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a cost to believing any </v>

1431
01:07:44.671 --> 01:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>dogma that the problem is any dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any dogma,</v>

1432
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it's costly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1433
01:07:50.551 --> 01:07:55.551
<v Speaker 2>it depends what those look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are the price.</v>

1434
01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collateral damage of our culture.</v>

1435
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.793
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you confident that individual </v>

1436
01:08:02.191 --> 01:08:03.024
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my individual Russell brand </v>

1437
01:08:04.561 --> 01:08:06.900
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and your individual Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris consciousness,</v>

1438
01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.123
<v Speaker 2>are distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate things that are not </v>

1439
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>qualitatively similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not ultimately the same?</v>

1440
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1441
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.903
<v Speaker 1>know there is zero scientific evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>to suggest that all consciousness is </v>

1442
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.313
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would given you your research </v>

1443
01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>scientifically and personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual,</v>

1444
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigations.</v>

1445
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that suggest to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness is a phenomena,</v>

1446
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe universal?</v>

1447
01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's universal in the sense that that is</v>

1448
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:36.743
<v Speaker 3>simply the fact of experience is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the fact that there's something </v>

1449
01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:40.824
<v Speaker 3>that is like to be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's something that has liked to </v>

1450
01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:47.160
<v Speaker 3>be me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's almost analogous to space.</v>

1451
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:49.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the space in this room,</v>

1452
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:52.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1453
01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.990
<v Speaker 3>is seamless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1454
01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:56.700
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and undivided.</v>

1455
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:57.930
<v Speaker 3>And you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1456
01:08:57.931 --> 01:08:59.700
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the space?</v>

1457
01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Like what about the space inside this </v>
<v Speaker 3>water bottle?</v>

1458
01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:03.893
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's or what like where is the water </v>

1459
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.010
<v Speaker 3>bottle with reference to space?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1460
01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.170
<v Speaker 3>it's the only place it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1461
01:09:10.171 --> 01:09:11.004
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right there where the water bottle </v>

1462
01:09:12.391 --> 01:09:13.620
<v Speaker 3>is by move it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it moves.</v>

1463
01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1464
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.193
<v Speaker 3>there's no other place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so to ask if you're asking about </v>

1465
01:09:18.961 --> 01:09:20.910
<v Speaker 3>the space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1466
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.223
<v Speaker 3>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a kind of sameness regardless of </v>

1467
01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:27.840
<v Speaker 3>what object in that space you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1468
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:30.990
<v Speaker 3>And consciousness has that property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least conceptually.</v>

1469
01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't know how consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>arises in the physics of things.</v>

1470
01:09:35.611 --> 01:09:38.200
<v Speaker 3>We don't know if it's a product of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1471
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.133
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's certainly good reason to </v>

1472
01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 3>believe that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know how far down it goes.</v>

1473
01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.244
<v Speaker 3>It's probably could be a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>constituent of matter or it could arise </v>

1474
01:09:46.891 --> 01:09:49.380
<v Speaker 3>on the basis of assemblies of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1475
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.550
<v Speaker 1>The good reason to believe that it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Matt,</v>

1476
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.493
<v Speaker 1>that the more complex an organism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more evidence of functioning </v>

1477
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>rational consciousness there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1478
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:57.703
<v Speaker 3>Wa it's a me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just again here you sort of start the </v>

1479
01:10:02.711 --> 01:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>universe from the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1480
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:08.410
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1481
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find complex arrangements of matter </v>

1482
01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.733
<v Speaker 3>giving rise to different emergent </v>
<v Speaker 3>properties and life is one of those </v>

1483
01:10:17.621 --> 01:10:18.640
<v Speaker 3>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1484
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.130
<v Speaker 3>and all of the features of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reproduction and,</v>

1485
01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:23.270
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and metabolism and,</v>

1486
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:24.490
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1487
01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the order we see in,</v>

1488
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.880
<v Speaker 3>in the natural world is the result of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of increasing complexity.</v>

1489
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.700
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of some significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

1490
01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our case,</v>

1491
01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of years,</v>

1492
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 3>you find organisms that exhibit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>properties of consciousness,</v>

1493
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:45.440
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only,</v>

1494
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:50.441
<v Speaker 3>the only consciousness we're sure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>100% sure of is the consciousness in our</v>

1495
01:10:51.101 --> 01:10:53.170
<v Speaker 3>own case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can reason by analogy.</v>

1496
01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:56.680
<v Speaker 3>We look at dogs and other complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1497
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:58.030
<v Speaker 3>And we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1498
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:59.223
<v Speaker 3>to imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they don't have consciousness but </v>

1499
01:11:02.111 --> 01:11:03.340
<v Speaker 3>only seemed to have it.</v>

1500
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 3>That's actually not parsimonious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because I mean,</v>

1501
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.530
<v Speaker 3>they're so similar to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1502
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.393
<v Speaker 3>neurologically and in every other way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to imagine that the lights come on </v>

1503
01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>somewhere between them and us seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational.</v>

1504
01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:19.620
<v Speaker 3>But how far down that goes is anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>guess.</v>

1505
01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And intuitions really divides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ask,</v>

1506
01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:24.420
<v Speaker 3>most neuroscientists are philosophers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

1507
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>is there something that is like to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly?</v>

1508
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This got 100,000</v>

1509
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 3>neurons in his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1510
01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.230
<v Speaker 3>people just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1511
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.470
<v Speaker 3>it's that kind of coin toss right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is,</v>

1512
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1513
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:41.930
<v Speaker 3>so it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1514
01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:42.764
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we simply don't know at what point </v>

1515
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:45.440
<v Speaker 3>consciousness emerges and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1516
01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:49.110
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that single cells are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious in some way.</v>

1517
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1518
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 3>that like that wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't expect the,</v>

1519
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:52.913
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the living world to appear differently </v>

1520
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 3>if cells were conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1521
01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>

1522
01:11:58.311 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 3>it would be genuinely mysterious because</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the human brain,</v>

1523
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be a lot of neural </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

1524
01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:06.114
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most neural activity that is not </v>

1525
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:08.514
<v Speaker 3>associated with what you experience as </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness or I experienced as </v>

1526
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>consciousness from a first person side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1527
01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.890
<v Speaker 1>what motion you're activity is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to yeah,</v>

1528
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.670
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most anatomical biological stuff.</v>

1529
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1530
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.083
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of what your brain is doing isn't </v>

1531
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:27.720
<v Speaker 3>showing up in your first person </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience as conscious</v>

1532
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a cherry on the cake,</v>

1533
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the kidneys in the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the,</v>

1534
01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's the,</v>

1535
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.040
<v Speaker 3>the thing that ultimately matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1536
01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the content and,</v>

1537
01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:40.901
<v Speaker 3>and it's the only thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that any of us can be absolutely sure of</v>

1538
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:41.843
<v Speaker 3>and said this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my line about consciousness </v>

1539
01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 3>being the only thing in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't be an illusion.</v>

1540
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.423
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the first person to say this </v>

1541
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1542
01:12:49.351 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the only thing that is,</v>

1543
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.620
<v Speaker 3>has to be true of us no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistaken we might be a better everything</v>

1544
01:12:58.621 --> 01:12:59.330
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if this,</v>

1545
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 3>if we're on in the matrix right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just a,</v>

1546
01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just living in a simulation on </v>

1547
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:08.301
<v Speaker 3>some alien supercomputer and none of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we think is real is actually real.</v>

1548
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness is still real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the consciousness is just simply the</v>

1549
01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 3>fact that anything seems to be happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1550
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:14.993
<v Speaker 3>Or if you're really asleep and dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now and we're not really doing </v>

1551
01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.024
<v Speaker 3>this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're totally confused about your </v>

1552
01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:20.904
<v Speaker 3>actual circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're actually not confused about </v>

1553
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:23.370
<v Speaker 3>the fact that your conscious,</v>

1554
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.303
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would explain why I've got no </v>

1555
01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:27.760
<v Speaker 1>trousers and pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1556
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping you had trousers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1557
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.100
<v Speaker 1>see how you just described </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

1558
01:13:34.101 --> 01:13:34.934
<v Speaker 1>then it's potentially sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction then suddenly up personal </v>

1559
01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that we can be set and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not an illusion.</v>

1560
01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Many of you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:44.180
<v Speaker 1>sort of the Mahara Mahabharata and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of our Gita and many of these ideas</v>

1562
01:13:44.181 --> 01:13:49.181
<v Speaker 1>are sort of using a vernacular that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally termin by the time in which it</v>

1563
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.124
<v Speaker 1>was conceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It talks about these ideas that mayor </v>

1564
01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.200
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1565
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1566
01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.853
<v Speaker 1>and for me like that because of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he also said that list of values </v>

1567
01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>that would be useful and which I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1568
01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:06.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they have their part of the baby in</v>

1569
01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 1>the bath water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>

1570
01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that possibly within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1571
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.320
<v Speaker 1>like if can somehow extract what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive from a,</v>

1572
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.220
<v Speaker 1>what is called religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it might,</v>

1573
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it leads us to ideas such as fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unity,</v>

1574
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and like with the,</v>

1575
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>or do you not find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1576
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.633
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now connections between what you </v>

1577
01:14:31.851 --> 01:14:32.684
<v Speaker 1>have learned in neuroscience and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've learned from studying sort of </v>

1578
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism.</v>

1579
01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The connections are very direct,</v>

1580
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:39.643
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1581
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:40.850
<v Speaker 1>how'd they know that stuff?</v>

1582
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:41.763
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't want well but just because </v>

1583
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:47.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the nature of consciousness is</v>

1584
01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:48.653
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about people who have </v>

1585
01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:51.580
<v Speaker 3>spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the Buddhist case,</v>

1586
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I just an incredible amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying from aunt,</v>

1587
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 3>from the first person side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What experiences,</v>

1588
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.810
<v Speaker 3>like what his character is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what one analogy would be.</v>

1589
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the central,</v>

1590
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 3>the central claim of Buddhism is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just Buddhism but,</v>

1591
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.633
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddhism and I would put several of the </v>

1592
01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Indian traditions like Advaita Vedanta </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there with the central claims at the,</v>

1593
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.190
<v Speaker 3>the self is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The EGO is an illusion.</v>

1594
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I say self,</v>

1595
01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:22.114
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that people are illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that the sense that you have a </v>

1596
01:15:25.091 --> 01:15:28.730
<v Speaker 3>subject riding around in your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking your thoughts right there.</v>

1597
01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 3>That there's a thinker in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thoughts.</v>

1598
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 3>That's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes perfect sense.</v>

1599
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1600
01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:39.370
<v Speaker 3>there's no place in the brain for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ego to be sitting.</v>

1601
01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no central place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes together.</v>

1602
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no unchanging center in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1603
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.903
<v Speaker 3>You're just talking about a cascade of </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurophysiology and everything is </v>

1604
01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 3>distributed everywhere and it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are various parts of the brain</v>

1605
01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 3>that are coming online and off and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1606
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 3>and subserving conscious dates and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1607
01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a process and there is there if you</v>

1608
01:16:01.721 --> 01:16:02.554
<v Speaker 3>could experience consciousness as a flow</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sensory and emotional and </v>

1609
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:11.374
<v Speaker 3>interoceptive experience without a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sense that there's an unchanging </v>

1610
01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 3>center riding around on that flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1611
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Like a man in a boat on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the stream of consciousness.</v>

1612
01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1613
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.700
<v Speaker 3>if you could experience that </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness without that,</v>

1614
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.373
<v Speaker 3>that would be an experience that is much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more coincident with what we understand </v>

1615
01:16:33.941 --> 01:16:34.774
<v Speaker 3>neurologically it that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be to experience something </v>

1616
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 3>that is more true from the third person </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain-based,</v>

1617
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 3>what do we see inside the head side?</v>

1618
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.240
<v Speaker 3>And it just so happens you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that.</v>

1619
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:47.103
<v Speaker 3>That is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is how that is what meditation is </v>

1620
01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:50.470
<v Speaker 3>like when you really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditate.</v>

1621
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:51.663
<v Speaker 3>This sense that there's a meditator in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head strategically paying attention </v>

1622
01:16:56.590 --> 01:17:00.340
<v Speaker 3>to experience rather than just pure </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that drops away.</v>

1623
01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:00.911
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1624
01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>this is one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one piece of data in favor of,</v>

1625
01:17:03.581 --> 01:17:06.040
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of introspection here.</v>

1626
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:07.263
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a piece that the western </v>

1627
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>intellectual tradition or the West or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the western spiritual tradition ever got</v>

1628
01:17:13.551 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 3>a good hand handle on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1629
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.013
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find specific Christian and </v>

1630
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Jewish and Muslim mystics making these </v>
<v Speaker 3>noises,</v>

1631
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.793
<v Speaker 3>but they make the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they make these noises </v>

1632
01:17:22.641 --> 01:17:23.474
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start to sound like Buddhists and </v>

1633
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 3>their co-religionists want to kill them </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather often.</v>

1634
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:32.280
<v Speaker 1>The religionists the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1635
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>and ease within nation states and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic life.</v>

1636
01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:37.010
<v Speaker 1>People start believing they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

1637
01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very out to market at them.</v>

1638
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we haven't had a lot of problems,</v>

1639
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 3>people with people being killed for not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing enough shopping and shopping malls</v>

1640
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.433
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I,</v>

1641
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.533
<v Speaker 1>unless there's a shoe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shopping mall and that's the </v>

1642
01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff they buy in the shopping mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill some.</v>

1643
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1644
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.813
<v Speaker 3>I looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the history of </v>

1645
01:17:51.341 --> 01:17:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and Judaism and Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find people who,</v>

1646
01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:56.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are explicitly dualistic </v>

1647
01:17:57.731 --> 01:17:59.290
<v Speaker 3>traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a soul,</v>

1648
01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:00.213
<v Speaker 3>you have a soul that exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the divine and that </v>

1649
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:06.183
<v Speaker 3>division,</v>

1650
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it's maintain the theological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say sam high risk.</v>

1651
01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:09.723
<v Speaker 1>The reason that bifurcation occurred is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because I wear man's </v>

1652
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:16.004
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the divine prioritized</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the manner that you've just been </v>

1653
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems a neurologically Apisai where</v>

1654
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 1>that to become our priority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic,</v>

1655
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.823
<v Speaker 1>let's call it lifestyle and mechanistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social mechanistic social systems such </v>

1656
01:18:32.031 --> 01:18:34.760
<v Speaker 1>as the ones that we inhabit would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

1657
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertile.</v>

1658
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.153
<v Speaker 1>Because if people believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate reality was not being </v>

1659
01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 1>experienced by the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no self that,</v>

1660
01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and binds us,</v>

1661
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.393
<v Speaker 1>that makes oneness a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That starts to suggest that your </v>

1662
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and my consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately are the same.</v>

1663
01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Or at least there's nothing to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are any different.</v>

1664
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.850
<v Speaker 1>And that the things that we believe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be different,</v>

1665
01:18:55.851 --> 01:18:57.220
<v Speaker 1>a superficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1666
01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.080
<v Speaker 1>accents acquired through culture,</v>

1667
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.980
<v Speaker 3>that's also true materially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1668
01:19:01.981 --> 01:19:02.814
<v Speaker 3>and we shouldn't give the material short</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip because the material progress is </v>

1669
01:19:08.301 --> 01:19:12.470
<v Speaker 3>the thing that frees attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1670
01:19:12.471 --> 01:19:13.470
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1671
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:18.550
<v Speaker 3>you roll back the clock long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find people living in just perpetual</v>

1672
01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 3>states of trying not to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1673
01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:24.250
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1674
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fending off wild animals.</v>

1675
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.870
<v Speaker 3>You're exposed to the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1676
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.733
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're suffering the consequences of </v>

1677
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.470
<v Speaker 3>disease and you have no concept of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease is,</v>

1678
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:34.304
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know about the germ theory of </v>

1679
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:39.220
<v Speaker 3>disease and you and your child dies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's because the,</v>

1680
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:43.460
<v Speaker 3>your neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she shined the evil eye on the child,</v>

1681
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:43.761
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1682
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:44.390
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1683
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you have magical beliefs accounting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes in the world and they're,</v>

1684
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 3>they're completely fallacious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1685
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 3>So the progress we've made in </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that the material world is</v>

1686
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:55.814
<v Speaker 3>all to the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except we have all of these misaligned </v>

1687
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:02.520
<v Speaker 3>incentive problems and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1688
01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 3>externalized damages to two very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and be like,</v>

1689
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 3>you want an iphone.</v>

1690
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.113
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't want people jumping off </v>

1691
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:12.750
<v Speaker 3>the roof of foxconn because life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>such,</v>

1692
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 3>it's so painful they're being to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make an iphone.</v>

1693
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1694
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.500
<v Speaker 3>so is it possible to make an iphone </v>
<v Speaker 3>without creating just unendurable misery</v>

1695
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 3>for some number of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Undoubtedly.</v>

1696
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.860
<v Speaker 3>It must be true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1697
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:28.230
<v Speaker 3>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't figured it out yet.</v>

1698
01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:29.543
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as to make that the default and we </v>

1699
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:35.680
<v Speaker 3>need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>

1700
01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:36.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing,</v>

1701
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:40.223
<v Speaker 3>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no distance between the </v>

1702
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:43.700
<v Speaker 3>material and the spiritual here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1703
01:20:43.701 --> 01:20:46.290
<v Speaker 3>so cause if consciousness is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter of,</v>

1704
01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 3>of information processing in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1705
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:50.724
<v Speaker 3>the right complex systems and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness could one day be born in </v>

1706
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>our computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1707
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:56.710
<v Speaker 3>well then we'll have an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation to,</v>

1708
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.010
<v Speaker 3>to not make our computer suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1709
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 3>If Siri could suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1710
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.240
<v Speaker 3>well then it matters how you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1711
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would matter every,</v>

1712
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.950
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to complicate life.</v>

1713
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're not obviously not there yet or</v>

1714
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:15.960
<v Speaker 3>it certainly seems obvious that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not there yet,</v>

1715
01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:16.794
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point we will very </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely either be in the presence of </v>

1716
01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:23.910
<v Speaker 3>conscious machines or think we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1717
01:21:23.911 --> 01:21:24.744
<v Speaker 3>We'll lose sight of the they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll emulate conscious systems in a </v>

1718
01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 3>compelling enough way that our default </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be,</v>

1719
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:34.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm in relationship to this thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1720
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 3>and to withdraw a sense of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that case would seem,</v>

1721
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:40.613
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just unprincipled and unethical and </v>

1722
01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 3>we'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have,</v>

1723
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1724
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.753
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could well build machines that seem </v>

1725
01:21:48.011 --> 01:21:48.844
<v Speaker 3>to have emotional lives and even have </v>
<v Speaker 3>more richer emotional lives than we do </v>

1726
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to have access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of human knowledge,</v>

1727
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:56.940
<v Speaker 3>all of human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1728
01:21:56.941 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 3>all of the aesthetic products of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human ingenuity for all of history.</v>

1729
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.753
<v Speaker 3>And they'll be able to talk about them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and appreciate them and remind you of </v>

1730
01:22:05.461 --> 01:22:06.294
<v Speaker 3>how much you love certain things and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and react to your emotion faster and </v>

1731
01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:15.210
<v Speaker 3>more accurately than your best friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>or your or your spouse.</v>

1732
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could bill,</v>

1733
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.233
<v Speaker 3>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will very likely build these </v>

1734
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:18.804
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we have an understood how </v>

1735
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.350
<v Speaker 3>consciousness arises in physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

1736
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>will think they're conscious and we will</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe right or wrong about that.</v>

1737
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:26.694
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether we're right or wrong about </v>

1738
01:22:28.231 --> 01:22:31.310
<v Speaker 3>that will be a huge consequence because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1739
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 3>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be,</v>

1740
01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:34.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1741
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:36.953
<v Speaker 3>it would be an absolutely abhorrent act </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build conscious systems that can </v>

1742
01:22:41.401 --> 01:22:44.660
<v Speaker 3>suffer in ways we don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just,</v>

1743
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:46.490
<v Speaker 3>just to cavalierly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 3>spawn this off in simulations and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1745
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:52.590
<v Speaker 3>on the Amazon cloud and not know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell we're doing.</v>

1746
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 1>For me that of course we've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>created like the,</v>

1747
01:22:55.750 --> 01:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>this is not just a hypothesis because </v>
<v Speaker 1>already all around us as we've already,</v>

1748
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:02.220
<v Speaker 1>fleetingly discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie scattered,</v>

1749
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:03.323
<v Speaker 1>they're damaged and broken and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably conscious entities that are </v>

1750
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:09.140
<v Speaker 1>fellow human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our fellow English,</v>

1751
01:23:09.141 --> 01:23:09.974
<v Speaker 1>but in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans scattered and broken around </v>

1752
01:23:12.881 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Sam,</v>

1753
01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:14.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me there's two points to Raha </v>

1754
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>cause we've got a much longer than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended to.</v>

1755
01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was trippy how like,</v>

1756
01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1757
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:21.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1758
01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a lot of questions still.</v>

1759
01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine on time so you can just,</v>

1760
01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if I can do as one tumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>dryer,</v>

1761
01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.750
<v Speaker 2>one s whirling neurological sprawl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One evening</v>

1762
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.160
<v Speaker 1>we stick regurgitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1763
01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:37.770
<v Speaker 1>in your general direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are the things that interest me.</v>

1764
01:23:37.771 --> 01:23:40.800
<v Speaker 1>One on a podcast I was listening to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do once a like an,</v>

1765
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.713
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea that sort of more commonly </v>

1766
01:23:43.231 --> 01:23:46.890
<v Speaker 1>understood that possibly freewill is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion that decisions are made prior.</v>

1767
01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:51.891
<v Speaker 1>So morality and ethics sort of suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>some what if that's true too?</v>

1768
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that final part holds are </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1769
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Or you can have your morality and ethics</v>
<v Speaker 2>without free will.</v>

1770
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Can I have morality and ethics without </v>
<v Speaker 2>free?</v>

1771
01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 2>But they roll it by the way.</v>

1772
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Evaluate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has to be sort of looked at differently.</v>

1773
01:24:09.381 --> 01:24:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Do it in one big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me do my vomit.</v>

1774
01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Girlfriend used to use back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yours is more piecemeal.</v>

1775
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:16.663
<v Speaker 1>Mine's a sort of a literal slu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yours says it has all sorts of </v>

1776
01:24:19.611 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and academia to bill on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1777
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Of a what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minecraft.</v>

1778
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:27.000
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1779
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.780
<v Speaker 1>so Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is when you were a,</v>

1780
01:24:29.781 --> 01:24:30.614
<v Speaker 1>when you've taken psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you not experience a things that </v>

1781
01:24:34.221 --> 01:24:35.054
<v Speaker 1>comparable to what you described is </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologically demonstrable and what </v>

1782
01:24:38.511 --> 01:24:39.530
<v Speaker 1>you've experienced in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1783
01:24:39.531 --> 01:24:42.920
<v Speaker 1>in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sense that your individual identity is</v>

1784
01:24:42.921 --> 01:24:43.754
<v Speaker 1>a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1785
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confection of sort of ideas and </v>

1786
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.680
<v Speaker 1>sensation and that there isn't sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1787
01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.260
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself taking Alicia,</v>

1788
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm clean now for 15 years,</v>

1789
01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:55.850
<v Speaker 1>but prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I used to take hallucinogens,</v>

1790
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.103
<v Speaker 1>the thing I didn't have the vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery or education to understand </v>

1791
01:25:01.431 --> 01:25:02.510
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was going on.</v>

1792
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:03.343
<v Speaker 1>And I wish I'd been born into some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shamanic tradition where people </v>

1793
01:25:05.391 --> 01:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>taught you what spirit is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they tell you what it used to be,</v>

1794
01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're taught you,</v>

1795
01:25:08.781 --> 01:25:09.614
<v Speaker 1>what love is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to behave and how to create </v>

1796
01:25:11.151 --> 01:25:15.320
<v Speaker 1>systems and how to father a daughter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to take care of regardless.</v>

1797
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I experienced something within my </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

1798
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I seemingly be on my identity as a 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old boy.</v>

1799
01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1800
01:25:22.371 --> 01:25:25.550
<v Speaker 1>this is not who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not this body.</v>

1801
01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:26.563
<v Speaker 1>My consciousness is other than this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily individuated form that only </v>

1802
01:25:33.381 --> 01:25:34.530
<v Speaker 1>the distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1803
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just on the,</v>

1804
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.810
<v Speaker 1>on a physics level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything was one,</v>

1805
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:39.763
<v Speaker 1>everything is expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am only experiencing time in an </v>

1806
01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:43.754
<v Speaker 1>animalistic way because of my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>entropy and atrophy where I are </v>

1807
01:25:47.421 --> 01:25:52.421
<v Speaker 1>limitless in a terminal material being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see myself as part of the whole,</v>

1808
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.473
<v Speaker 1>as part of oneness because the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I narrativize my life is as a result of </v>

1809
01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 1>biocentric experience as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective experience.</v>

1810
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I've just been subjected to this stimuli</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've built an identity around it.</v>

1811
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>It felt extremely true and it stayed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me ever since.</v>

1812
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And I've revisited it through meditation</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1813
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from it being a,</v>

1814
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>an interesting experience intellectually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an interesting experience emotionally</v>

1815
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.103
<v Speaker 1>and spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if this sense of oneness does not </v>

1816
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>translate into a sort of a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical code,</v>

1817
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 1>that means I treat people lovingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is its value?</v>

1818
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:33.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you experienced that state and what</v>

1819
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>do you think of it are moral and ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>implications on an individual?</v>

1820
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:39.130
<v Speaker 1>And what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it translate into behavior?</v>

1821
01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1822
01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.970
<v Speaker 3>there are two states I would want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate.</v>

1823
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:43.143
<v Speaker 3>There are two ways in which you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the loss of self and the </v>

1824
01:26:46.711 --> 01:26:48.090
<v Speaker 3>sense of oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1825
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with psychedelics,</v>

1826
01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you get to come back to what I said </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1827
01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:55.170
<v Speaker 3>You have consciousness and its contents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1828
01:26:55.171 --> 01:26:56.004
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the fact that things are </v>

1829
01:26:57.511 --> 01:26:58.344
<v Speaker 3>appearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the fact that there is </v>

1830
01:26:59.251 --> 01:27:04.251
<v Speaker 3>experience and consciousness is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing aspect of experience.</v>

1831
01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:08.310
<v Speaker 3>And nor in the normal course of events </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

1832
01:27:08.311 --> 01:27:09.144
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary sights and sounds and smells </v>

1833
01:27:10.471 --> 01:27:13.020
<v Speaker 3>and sensations and thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>

1834
01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:17.220
<v Speaker 3>And you go through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most people go through life thinking</v>

1835
01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.980
<v Speaker 3>every moment of the day in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that context.</v>

1836
01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:21.510
<v Speaker 3>And they don't know how to meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

1837
01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1838
01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.473
<v Speaker 3>they have this sort of white noise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>discursivity where they're talking to </v>

1839
01:27:27.421 --> 01:27:29.940
<v Speaker 3>themselves and everything they see and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1840
01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:31.020
<v Speaker 3>and sense.</v>

1841
01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And every interaction is filtered </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this conversation they're having</v>

1842
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:39.480
<v Speaker 3>with themselves and the world they see </v>
<v Speaker 3>visually and,</v>

1843
01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:42.260
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1844
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world they sense with,</v>

1845
01:27:43.831 --> 01:27:44.664
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with touch and other senses is tiled </v>

1846
01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.280
<v Speaker 3>over with concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

1847
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at a bottle and I see bottle,</v>

1848
01:27:50.071 --> 01:27:51.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the,</v>

1849
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:53.970
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this field of light and shadow and color</v>

1850
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:57.030
<v Speaker 3>is differentiated by concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see my phone,</v>

1851
01:27:57.031 --> 01:27:57.864
<v Speaker 3>I see a bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see the table and everything is </v>

1852
01:27:59.911 --> 01:28:00.744
<v Speaker 3>solidified that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what happens with psychedelics is </v>

1853
01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:05.123
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your habit pattern of thought and </v>

1854
01:28:08.161 --> 01:28:13.161
<v Speaker 3>attention is completely bowled over by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pharmacology of whatever you've just</v>

1855
01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.001
<v Speaker 3>ingested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1856
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:17.670
<v Speaker 3>So if it's acid or mushrooms or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1857
01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:21.840
<v Speaker 3>any of those classic psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just whoever you are,</v>

1858
01:28:21.841 --> 01:28:23.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever your talents are at </v>
<v Speaker 3>introspection,</v>

1859
01:28:23.911 --> 01:28:26.790
<v Speaker 3>we know whether you've ever wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditate or not.</v>

1860
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.033
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are guaranteed to have a change in </v>

1861
01:28:30.991 --> 01:28:31.710
<v Speaker 3>your experience.</v>

1862
01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:33.510
<v Speaker 3>If you take a sufficient dose of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic.</v>

1863
01:28:33.511 --> 01:28:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Now it can be a very chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant change.</v>

1864
01:28:35.971 --> 01:28:37.890
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can mimic psychosis right there.</v>

1865
01:28:37.891 --> 01:28:38.724
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad acid trip is really bad and not </v>

1866
01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:44.010
<v Speaker 3>spiritually uplifting at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1867
01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:44.873
<v Speaker 3>but a good one can put you in a state </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just unimaginably expansive </v>

1868
01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:53.220
<v Speaker 3>where it like all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the normal,</v>

1869
01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:57.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro kind of perceptual categories and,</v>

1870
01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 3>and emotional barriers between you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world breakdown.</v>

1871
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.053
<v Speaker 3>And there can be this kind of like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>this free as free flowing exchange of </v>

1872
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 3>energy and sense of oneness the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you can,</v>

1873
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:11.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you touch a tree with your hand and the,</v>

1874
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1875
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.690
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1876
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:15.563
<v Speaker 3>there can be kind of a laser like </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration in the sensation of just </v>

1877
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 3>having your hand make contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>

1878
01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 3>And they can be just as the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1879
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the energy,</v>

1880
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:29.250
<v Speaker 3>the energy of that touch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1881
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Can become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you turn,</v>

1882
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.013
<v Speaker 3>you're turning up the volume on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel of information and making it </v>

1883
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:37.470
<v Speaker 3>conscious in a way that it never is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in normal life.</v>

1884
01:29:37.471 --> 01:29:38.304
<v Speaker 3>And so you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could spend two hours just in this </v>

1885
01:29:40.201 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 3>kind of orgasmic union with a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1886
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I on the right drug now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1887
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 3>you can do all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have all of those changes happen</v>

1888
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:52.110
<v Speaker 3>in your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1889
01:29:52.111 --> 01:29:52.944
<v Speaker 3>like the full pyrotechnics of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic display without losing the </v>

1890
01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:01.250
<v Speaker 3>sense of an ego you can actually have at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1891
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:02.123
<v Speaker 3>You can still feel that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are the center of that and </v>

1892
01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:04.974
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

1893
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.220
<v Speaker 3>it's just so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1894
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:08.490
<v Speaker 3>or in the chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1895
01:30:08.491 --> 01:30:11.610
<v Speaker 3>psychotics side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much worse to be you at that moment.</v>

1896
01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation has a very,</v>

1897
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:17.263
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1898
01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.380
<v Speaker 3>if you go an intensive retreat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're spending,</v>

1899
01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 to 18 hours a day meditating,</v>

1900
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:25.380
<v Speaker 3>you can have psychedelic light changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the contents of consciousness.</v>

1901
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:26.543
<v Speaker 3>But the more important change for me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the insight that there is no center to </v>

1902
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:31.494
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was simply is consciousness </v>

1903
01:30:33.001 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 3>and everything appearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have that insight,</v>

1904
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:39.600
<v Speaker 3>it actually doesn't matter what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>appearing.</v>

1905
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.420
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you touch the tree,</v>

1906
01:30:42.421 --> 01:30:44.010
<v Speaker 3>it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1907
01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 3>a million watts of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sublime energy and there's no barrier</v>

1908
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:51.070
<v Speaker 3>between unit you and the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1909
01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 3>that is the same on some fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

1910
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:54.234
<v Speaker 3>That's the same as just seeing a water </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle and picking it up and having a </v>

1911
01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 3>drink in a completely otherwise ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of consciousness.</v>

1912
01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.960
<v Speaker 3>The center can drop out equally or be </v>
<v Speaker 3>present equally in both of those cases.</v>

1913
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 3>And I'm much more interested in finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1914
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.333
<v Speaker 3>this unifying experience of centerless </v>
<v Speaker 3>snus in the midst of whatever's </v>

1915
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:19.430
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of the,</v>

1916
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.700
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience or,</v>

1917
01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:24.990
<v Speaker 3>or any peak experiences that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they come and go,</v>

1918
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:25.520
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

1919
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 3>They're by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impermanent,</v>

1920
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:27.651
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1921
01:31:27.651 --> 01:31:28.484
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to bring some causes and </v>

1922
01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:31.524
<v Speaker 3>conditions together to make them happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're pharmacological or </v>

1923
01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Meditational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1924
01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.733
<v Speaker 3>he had to go on retreat for a year and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and meditate 18 hours a day in order to </v>

1925
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.780
<v Speaker 3>see those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1926
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 3>in or lights or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1927
01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 3>and or you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1928
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:49.920
<v Speaker 3>kind of blow your mind on acid and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of useless for the rest of the day.</v>

1929
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1930
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.230
<v Speaker 3>in order to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1931
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:54.323
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to have no ego and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>none of the problems which an ego gives </v>

1932
01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:06.180
<v Speaker 3>you in a state of otherwise totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary consciousness in it,</v>

1933
01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 3>in a state that's compatible with having</v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation.</v>

1934
01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.673
<v Speaker 3>It's just you either feel like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone behind your face in this moment </v>

1935
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:16.630
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>

1936
01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like if you're looking at me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking at you,</v>

1937
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:22.420
<v Speaker 3>the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the default state of consciousness is to</v>

1938
01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:27.421
<v Speaker 3>feel like you're behind your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking out at a world that's not self.</v>

1939
01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:29.403
<v Speaker 3>Like you're over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of behind the mask that is </v>

1940
01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 3>your face and you're looking at me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the end.</v>

1941
01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>And when I look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I react to something you say,</v>

1942
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:38.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say,</v>

1943
01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's clearly bullshit way,</v>

1944
01:32:40.761 --> 01:32:41.594
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't thought that through that </v>

1945
01:32:42.371 --> 01:32:45.660
<v Speaker 3>feeling of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point in it like this,</v>

1946
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 3>you're implicated over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1947
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.980
<v Speaker 3>And you begin to react based on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>implication.</v>

1948
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 3>It's possible a lose that and to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just just the world remains and yet</v>

1949
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:58.510
<v Speaker 3>nothing else changes their doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no strange lights.</v>

1950
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 3>There's no Kundalini in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

1951
01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Nothing has to get weird or psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1952
01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:08.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter if it does get weird.</v>

1953
01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.353
<v Speaker 1>No and I please know you'll write that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a of if there is no pragmatism </v>

1954
01:33:12.991 --> 01:33:13.824
<v Speaker 1>to spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there isn't a practical application </v>

1955
01:33:16.711 --> 01:33:20.130
<v Speaker 1>to these extreme experiences within </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

1956
01:33:20.131 --> 01:33:20.964
<v Speaker 1>then what is their value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is is that the sort of </v>

1957
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:29.830
<v Speaker 1>linguistics and grammar of mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apparent separateness,</v>

1958
01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very notion of you and die.</v>

1959
01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.370
<v Speaker 1>There are moments where I experienced it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as temporal.</v>

1960
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:42.690
<v Speaker 1>There are moments where to use the Great</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks is I think perfect phrase.</v>

1961
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel that we are one consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing itself subjectively.</v>

1962
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:53.900
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about the loss of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>being behind the mask of the face for me</v>

1963
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:58.703
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about enlightenment and </v>

1964
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.133
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about rather ascetic </v>

1965
01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.153
<v Speaker 1>version of that without bells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whistles and pyrotechnics to use your </v>

1966
01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:10.344
<v Speaker 1>earlier phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But similarly when you talk about the </v>

1967
01:34:11.581 --> 01:34:12.414
<v Speaker 1>Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of very emotional description </v>

1968
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:16.740
<v Speaker 1>of connection and love.</v>

1969
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.933
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the kinds of experiences that </v>

1970
01:34:21.301 --> 01:34:26.301
<v Speaker 1>we need to convey into an environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that deprived of that kind of experience</v>

1971
01:34:27.151 --> 01:34:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and understanding create maximum </v>
<v Speaker 1>security prisons,</v>

1972
01:34:30.961 --> 01:34:35.961
<v Speaker 1>which find further means for degradation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gangs and separation.</v>

1973
01:34:36.151 --> 01:34:36.984
<v Speaker 1>Once within that we are living perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a time that is for me to turn it </v>

1974
01:34:40.891 --> 01:34:45.891
<v Speaker 1>around by the extraction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual as opposed to the,</v>

1975
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 1>because of the amplification of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

1976
01:34:52.321 --> 01:34:52.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1977
01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the distinction that you and I have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we view the world is that I feel</v>

1978
01:34:59.481 --> 01:35:04.481
<v Speaker 1>that the main agent in extracting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of spirit without,</v>

1979
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>which I don't see a solution for the 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people on this planet,</v>

1980
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:13.390
<v Speaker 1>that the main agent is post secular </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist culture and religion.</v>

1981
01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:17.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1982
01:35:17.561 --> 01:35:20.290
<v Speaker 3>it's not only religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1983
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it's dogmatism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bad ideas that,</v>

1984
01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:28.200
<v Speaker 3>that are immune from criticism and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and therefore remain effective.</v>

1985
01:35:29.230 --> 01:35:30.570
<v Speaker 3>So what we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1986
01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:31.413
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes back to conversation and </v>

1987
01:35:32.201 --> 01:35:34.450
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need successful conversations.</v>

1988
01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.613
<v Speaker 3>We need to converge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to find the thing that can be </v>

1989
01:35:38.111 --> 01:35:43.111
<v Speaker 3>said so as to get the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong to recognize it,</v>

1990
01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:44.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1991
01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 3>that's all of us some of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1992
01:35:46.570 --> 01:35:47.403
<v Speaker 3>Like if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how long do you want to be wrong </v>

1993
01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:49.360
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1994
01:35:49.361 --> 01:35:54.361
<v Speaker 3>how long do you want to be living under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sway of a powerful,</v>

1995
01:35:54.851 --> 01:35:55.684
<v Speaker 3>bad idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there are people who have powerful </v>

1996
01:35:57.551 --> 01:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>bad ideas that they class as religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1997
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.153
<v Speaker 3>who are determined to live the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives under the sway of those </v>

1998
01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:06.634
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how much evidence piles up </v>

1999
01:36:07.931 --> 01:36:10.840
<v Speaker 3>against them and no matter what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

2000
01:36:10.841 --> 01:36:13.600
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why religion for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a special character,</v>

2001
01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:17.650
<v Speaker 3>but political dogmatism is in many </v>
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>

2002
01:36:17.651 --> 01:36:20.170
<v Speaker 3>just as problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Economic dogmatism,</v>

2003
01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.753
<v Speaker 3>economic dogmatism in certain cases </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be the greatest engine of harm we </v>

2004
01:36:26.861 --> 01:36:27.970
<v Speaker 3>ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2005
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2006
01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.041
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2007
01:36:30.041 --> 01:36:32.200
<v Speaker 3>it matters what is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It matters.</v>

2008
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:36.730
<v Speaker 3>It matters what causes systems to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to reliably fail.</v>

2009
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:37.603
<v Speaker 1>It does sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And given that I think in the last few </v>

2010
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:41.143
<v Speaker 1>minutes of our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got close to something that seems </v>

2011
01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:43.994
<v Speaker 1>like a fundamental truth that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree on that there seems to be some </v>

2012
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:51.581
<v Speaker 1>essence behind temporal individuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has some kind of seeming university</v>

2013
01:36:52.221 --> 01:36:53.054
<v Speaker 1>allity though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could anybody ever possibly really </v>

2014
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 1>say that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can bring our focus as individuals</v>

2015
01:36:59.001 --> 01:36:59.834
<v Speaker 1>and as a society to that notion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion which does exist in all </v>

2016
01:37:04.071 --> 01:37:04.960
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2017
01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:05.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I would say in a relegated role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you said earlier in a role that,</v>

2019
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Mr [inaudible]</v>

2020
01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:15.740
<v Speaker 3>what's the reason to say that it exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>in all religions?</v>

2021
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.843
<v Speaker 3>Because what if it doesn't like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what then or what if it doesn't equally </v>

2022
01:37:19.821 --> 01:37:20.654
<v Speaker 3>or what if much of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the religion repudiates this core </v>

2023
01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:23.414
<v Speaker 3>truth?</v>

2024
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you and I are having </v>

2025
01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 1>the same conversation and agree about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental.</v>

2026
01:37:31.131 --> 01:37:31.964
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to elect to disagree for the </v>

2027
01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 1>purposes of hypotheses would be a silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do because within Christianity,</v>

2028
01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:38.774
<v Speaker 1>as you've already said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a mystical tradition within </v>

2029
01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is within Buddhism,</v>

2030
01:37:41.661 --> 01:37:45.490
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of more practically delineates</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gin is I don't know what religion,</v>

2031
01:37:45.491 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't enough about it.</v>

2032
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:47.383
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like that what excites me is when </v>

2033
01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:55.451
<v Speaker 1>I see perennial mythic template </v>
<v Speaker 1>recurring through folk law,</v>

2034
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:56.423
<v Speaker 1>faith Montefiore's in pantheism that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to infer the truth that you are </v>

2035
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:01.824
<v Speaker 1>personally describing that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelically described that you have </v>

2036
01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 1>neurologically describes me,</v>

2037
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:07.803
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's very important to realize that </v>

2038
01:38:09.521 --> 01:38:14.521
<v Speaker 3>they don't all do it equally and to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>lip service to the idea that they're all</v>

2039
01:38:15.611 --> 01:38:18.970
<v Speaker 3>teaching the same thing equally well is </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating,</v>

2040
01:38:18.971 --> 01:38:20.500
<v Speaker 3>I would argue an immense amount of harm,</v>

2041
01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's some trinity a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some dogmas and doctrines,</v>

2042
01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:28.460
<v Speaker 1>but say it doesn't exist and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant and that it's not there at all.</v>

2043
01:38:28.461 --> 01:38:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think like say take our two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

2044
01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the dominant ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies are drawn from religion.</v>

2045
01:38:37.601 --> 01:38:39.930
<v Speaker 1>They're drawn from sort of a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2046
01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.573
<v Speaker 1>posting lightened meant rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic ideas and from economic </v>

2047
01:38:45.261 --> 01:38:46.094
<v Speaker 1>ideas and colonial ideas and post a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westphalian tree ideas of state and </v>

2048
01:38:53.091 --> 01:38:54.530
<v Speaker 1>nation and power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2049
01:38:54.531 --> 01:38:58.790
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to like the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems aren't derived from a sort of a</v>

2050
01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:00.500
<v Speaker 1>religious source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they are,</v>

2051
01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:01.334
<v Speaker 1>they are the very component that share </v>
<v Speaker 1>those qualities with nonreligious power </v>

2052
01:39:05.631 --> 01:39:06.464
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important thing and the thing that </v>

2053
01:39:08.091 --> 01:39:08.924
<v Speaker 1>is not present almost by definition in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular culture is this idea of essence </v>

2054
01:39:15.170 --> 01:39:19.340
<v Speaker 1>and truth other than through mechanistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration through science,</v>

2055
01:39:19.341 --> 01:39:22.280
<v Speaker 1>which whilst as you have already eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly explained,</v>

2056
01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:27.340
<v Speaker 1>easy and valuable it cause like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've done talks that particular</v>

2057
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 1>that directly contradict this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't answer the questions of the</v>

2058
01:39:33.561 --> 01:39:34.394
<v Speaker 1>experience of essence yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps one day we will perhaps one </v>

2059
01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:38.414
<v Speaker 1>day we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it seems to me that there's some </v>

2060
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:40.733
<v Speaker 1>fighting</v>

2061
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:44.750
<v Speaker 3>one example that I think ties together a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of what we disagree about here and,</v>

2062
01:39:44.751 --> 01:39:47.590
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it crystallizes the,</v>

2063
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.680
<v Speaker 3>the point I am urging you to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

2064
01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:52.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the don't take it serious.</v>

2065
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Take it off.</v>

2066
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:56.650
<v Speaker 3>This particular point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mentors,</v>

2067
01:39:56.651 --> 01:39:58.710
<v Speaker 3>let me just crystallize this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2068
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

2069
01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.040
<v Speaker 3>the problem of dogmatism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why dogmatism is,</v>

2070
01:40:03.041 --> 01:40:03.874
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically always bad and </v>

2071
01:40:05.531 --> 01:40:07.060
<v Speaker 3>unforeseeably bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can net,</v>

2072
01:40:07.061 --> 01:40:12.061
<v Speaker 3>you can't in advance know how bad a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogma is going to be just by considering</v>

2073
01:40:12.071 --> 01:40:13.660
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentence on paper,</v>

2074
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.833
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the dogmatism is just the wrong </v>

2075
01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:20.710
<v Speaker 3>methodology for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for getting anywhere worth going because</v>

2076
01:40:20.711 --> 01:40:23.110
<v Speaker 3>it is the antithesis of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of open conversation.</v>

2077
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:24.423
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the example that I now </v>

2078
01:40:26.861 --> 01:40:31.050
<v Speaker 3>always used because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just is so clear the,</v>

2079
01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:35.380
<v Speaker 3>the dogma that all human life is equally</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacred,</v>

2080
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:40.750
<v Speaker 3>all human lives are equally valuable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that life starts at the first moment,</v>

2081
01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:44.080
<v Speaker 3>the moment of conception right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this on its face,</v>

2082
01:40:44.081 --> 01:40:46.240
<v Speaker 3>if you just told me if 20 years ago you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2083
01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:48.250
<v Speaker 3>what if someone who believes this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he,</v>

2084
01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:51.910
<v Speaker 3>what sort of needless human misery is he</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to manufacturer?</v>

2085
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2086
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:53.973
<v Speaker 3>is just a totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the most benign thing you could </v>

2087
01:40:55.451 --> 01:40:56.600
<v Speaker 3>possibly believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>

2088
01:40:56.610 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 3>who's going to get killed in the service</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this dogma,</v>

2089
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:00.603
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to have be be tortured for </v>

2090
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:03.154
<v Speaker 3>decades in the service of this dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at what people have </v>

2091
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:09.400
<v Speaker 3>traditionally done with this specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

2092
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.780
<v Speaker 3>and this is a Judeo Christian,</v>

2093
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.460
<v Speaker 1>the American constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalistic,</v>

2094
01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:15.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2095
01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but especially this,</v>

2096
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:18.850
<v Speaker 3>this the link to the moment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conception.</v>

2097
01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:19.681
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2098
01:41:19.681 --> 01:41:20.514
<v Speaker 3>you'll look at the millions of Americans</v>
<v Speaker 3>who opposed embryonic stem cell </v>

2099
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:24.850
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2100
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:27.320
<v Speaker 3>With all the promise that held right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2101
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 3>we have petri dishes filled with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's imagined,</v>

2102
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:32.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of human souls that,</v>

2103
01:41:32.730 --> 01:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>that are microscopic and to kill those </v>
<v Speaker 3>souls would be tantamount to murder.</v>

2104
01:41:38.981 --> 01:41:39.814
<v Speaker 3>To experiment on those souls would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>tantamount to murder and therefore they </v>

2105
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:46.240
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to have a conversation about</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the,</v>

2106
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:47.223
<v Speaker 3>the children and adults with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with life deranging injuries and </v>

2107
01:41:50.711 --> 01:41:52.960
<v Speaker 3>diseases who might've been helped had </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2108
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:54.063
<v Speaker 3>had progress been made in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that is a psychotic moral attitude </v>

2109
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:03.940
<v Speaker 3>made possible by the most benign seeming</v>
<v Speaker 3>dogma,</v>

2110
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:04.983
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally we're talking about </v>

2111
01:42:05.531 --> 01:42:06.364
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could</v>

2112
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:09.600
<v Speaker 1>just one aspect of it and they said an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable squeamishness about human</v>

2113
01:42:09.601 --> 01:42:13.200
<v Speaker 1>life and we've all seen that the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby pro life type images and stuff.</v>

2114
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:16.560
<v Speaker 1>But also Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an ongoing dialectic between the</v>

2115
01:42:16.561 --> 01:42:17.394
<v Speaker 1>scientific community and religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>community who's got the right to be the </v>

2116
01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:21.563
<v Speaker 1>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parental figure in ownership of the </v>

2117
01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:27.090
<v Speaker 1>public sphere and the public's Seoul in </v>
<v Speaker 1>inverted commerce.</v>

2118
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2119
01:42:28.231 --> 01:42:29.064
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of kick back at Vista </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickback from Christian groups over the </v>

2120
01:42:33.071 --> 01:42:33.701
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:42:33.701 --> 01:42:37.280
<v Speaker 1>like evidently beneficial scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors,</v>

2122
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.990
<v Speaker 3>barely held belief is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe so,</v>

2123
01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:41.063
<v Speaker 3>but interest the Zygote at the moment of</v>
<v Speaker 3>conception and then therefore I'm </v>

2124
01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:43.650
<v Speaker 3>worried.</v>

2125
01:42:43.650 --> 01:42:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And is it sort of an interesting sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion and I,</v>

2126
01:42:47.221 --> 01:42:48.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you and I would be on the same </v>

2127
01:42:48.721 --> 01:42:50.940
<v Speaker 1>side of that particular argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>

2128
01:42:50.941 --> 01:42:51.774
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I would say is that we need to </v>

2129
01:42:53.851 --> 01:42:58.590
<v Speaker 1>again revert to focusing on what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly divine or sublime.</v>

2130
01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:00.690
<v Speaker 1>These moments of interconnectivity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>oneness.</v>

2131
01:43:00.691 --> 01:43:05.691
<v Speaker 1>And then we wouldn't need trash </v>
<v Speaker 1>talismans to be placeholders for meaning</v>

2132
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:07.013
<v Speaker 1>in a culture that has lost its meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in significant part because </v>

2133
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the role of the spiritual has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>relegated to meaninglessness in favor of</v>

2134
01:43:15.361 --> 01:43:18.270
<v Speaker 1>a materialistic mechanistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally that leads ultimately to sort</v>

2135
01:43:18.271 --> 01:43:21.450
<v Speaker 1>of widespread consumerism and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2136
01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:24.360
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and consciousness and consciousness that</v>

2137
01:43:24.361 --> 01:43:25.194
<v Speaker 1>we are continually in that world of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reiterative for constant tangled </v>

2138
01:43:31.201 --> 01:43:32.034
<v Speaker 1>thought that because people have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the sublime of the divine </v>

2139
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:36.070
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2140
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2141
01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2142
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 3>miss you have your own fetishistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

2143
01:43:42.611 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this notion of consumerism,</v>

2144
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:45.761
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a consumer,</v>

2145
01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:46.594
<v Speaker 3>like you and I are having this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in a podcast studio at </v>

2146
01:43:50.441 --> 01:43:51.610
<v Speaker 3>headspace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2147
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Headspace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a meditation APP that on,</v>

2148
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:55.604
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand is the quintessence of </v>

2149
01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 3>consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2150
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 3>this is something that only happens in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>smartphone right there.</v>

2151
01:44:03.741 --> 01:44:04.574
<v Speaker 3>The various phone that I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this causing people to jump off </v>

2152
01:44:06.411 --> 01:44:07.490
<v Speaker 3>rooftops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2153
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet,</v>

2154
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:13.280
<v Speaker 3>I think headspace is absolutely good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to have out there.</v>

2155
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:13.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2156
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:15.450
<v Speaker 3>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2157
01:44:15.451 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 3>it's bringing a incredibly useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice to millions of people.</v>

2158
01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:21.063
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and podcasts bring incredibly useful </v>

2159
01:44:23.331 --> 01:44:24.164
<v Speaker 3>conversations to millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of this is enabled by mere </v>

2160
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 3>materialism and mirror consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2161
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.053
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be an ethical and spiritually </v>

2162
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:35.323
<v Speaker 3>correct way to do all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of getting rid of the </v>

2163
01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:39.540
<v Speaker 3>microphones and getting rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartphones.</v>

2164
01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:40.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2166
01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just the same way as you would pause</v>

2167
01:44:43.971 --> 01:44:44.804
<v Speaker 1>it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there an extremist and dangerous </v>

2168
01:44:46.491 --> 01:44:50.350
<v Speaker 1>version of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would say has the,</v>

2169
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's an essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent idea.</v>

2170
01:44:53.001 --> 01:44:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I would disagree with that strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2171
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2172
01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.810
<v Speaker 1>people having objects isn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

2173
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:00.673
<v Speaker 1>but to fetishize objects and to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's some kind of fulfillment and </v>

2174
01:45:04.491 --> 01:45:05.324
<v Speaker 1>spiritual solution can be achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the acquisition of objects is </v>

2175
01:45:09.591 --> 01:45:10.424
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and all the more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not so explicitly </v>

2176
01:45:13.491 --> 01:45:15.410
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what's happening.</v>

2177
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:16.380
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2178
01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2179
01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:17.873
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremist ideology that we already </v>

2180
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 1>live with in is so all encompassing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot see it's horizons that we have</v>

2181
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:25.490
<v Speaker 1>lost the tools to understand it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>

2182
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about sort of a post </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalinist leftist position.</v>

2183
01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the reinvention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reembracing of the human soul.</v>

2184
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Can we find that you've talked a Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly about we need to have a </v>

2185
01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:38.781
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2186
01:45:38.781 --> 01:45:41.240
<v Speaker 1>you and I are having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in God.</v>

2187
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:42.163
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that the differences </v>

2188
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:48.140
<v Speaker 1>aren't actually when it boils down to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meaningful.</v>

2189
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Because when it comes to love of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters freedom,</v>

2190
01:45:51.930 --> 01:45:55.550
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ultimately believe the same things.</v>

2191
01:45:55.551 --> 01:45:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that that unless you and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a way of saying,</v>

2192
01:45:58.341 --> 01:45:59.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect that.</v>

2193
01:45:59.841 --> 01:46:00.201
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:03.710
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people whose guidance I seek,</v>

2195
01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:05.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

2196
01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:07.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earnestly are atheists,</v>

2197
01:46:07.641 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't change.</v>

2198
01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:11.510
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I believe that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

2199
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:12.403
<v Speaker 1>there are levels of consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are beyond material phenomena that will </v>

2200
01:46:15.591 --> 01:46:16.424
<v Speaker 1>net will never understand free </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnifications of the human senses or </v>

2201
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.010
<v Speaker 1>further analysis of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2202
01:46:21.011 --> 01:46:26.011
<v Speaker 1>of the material objects because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are limitations to the human mind,</v>

2203
01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:28.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2204
01:46:28.211 --> 01:46:31.100
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>

2205
01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that all of this stuff,</v>

2206
01:46:33.951 --> 01:46:34.950
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2207
01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:35.813
<v Speaker 1>a theorial wittering has no meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it translates into love and </v>

2208
01:46:40.371 --> 01:46:42.980
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless there is some meaning in the idea</v>

2209
01:46:42.981 --> 01:46:43.814
<v Speaker 1>that there is some connection between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree in a hand if you achieve the </v>

2210
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.570
<v Speaker 1>correct mental state.</v>

2211
01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:48.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2212
01:46:48.271 --> 01:46:51.540
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are wrinkles here that I just want</v>

2213
01:46:51.541 --> 01:46:52.374
<v Speaker 3>to flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that extreme and mental pleasure </v>

2214
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>is divorced from ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>

2215
01:46:59.041 --> 01:46:59.874
<v Speaker 3>to go back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this perverse case that we started with </v>

2216
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.380
<v Speaker 3>suicide bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2217
01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:05.453
<v Speaker 3>I have good reason to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental state of a suicide bomber before </v>

2218
01:47:09.721 --> 01:47:11.820
<v Speaker 3>he thinks euphoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2219
01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:12.360
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2220
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.193
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about suicidal people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are just trying to end the </v>

2221
01:47:15.991 --> 01:47:16.824
<v Speaker 3>depression as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about people who are on </v>

2222
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>the cusp of the,</v>

2223
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.660
<v Speaker 1>the deepest spiritual reward that </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer's Tommy,</v>

2224
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:27.030
<v Speaker 1>we stopped on miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a person,</v>

2225
01:47:27.031 --> 01:47:31.020
<v Speaker 1>like a policeman that's willing to risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own life to rescue,</v>

2226
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:33.330
<v Speaker 1>rescue a child in Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

2227
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:36.750
<v Speaker 1>their regard for their own life is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned in that moment.</v>

2228
01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And that too could be described as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of euphoria because it like,</v>

2229
01:47:40.701 --> 01:47:43.110
<v Speaker 1>it happens to fit in with our worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're cool with it.</v>

2230
01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:43.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2231
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:44.121
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2232
01:47:44.121 --> 01:47:44.471
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2233
01:47:44.471 --> 01:47:45.304
<v Speaker 3>but so that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real consequences for human beings </v>

2234
01:47:48.551 --> 01:47:52.480
<v Speaker 3>matter and it's possible to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2235
01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:57.550
<v Speaker 3>euphoria is something and in a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning is something that can be totally</v>

2236
01:47:57.551 --> 01:47:58.384
<v Speaker 3>misaligned with what I think we would </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree is an actual ethical relationship </v>

2237
01:48:02.021 --> 01:48:05.620
<v Speaker 3>and an actual spiritual insight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's it.</v>

2238
01:48:05.621 --> 01:48:08.500
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so euphoria is not a perfect guide.</v>

2239
01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:12.670
<v Speaker 3>It can be very misleading guide for </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom and compassion.</v>

2240
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.780
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the point.</v>

2241
01:48:13.781 --> 01:48:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2242
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It's true of Nixon bloody bad decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result.</v>

2243
01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2244
01:48:18.141 --> 01:48:18.974
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the absence of euphoria can also be </v>

2245
01:48:20.811 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 3>misleading because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2246
01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:22.973
<v Speaker 3>they're genuinely like what I just said </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this kind of non dual experience </v>

2247
01:48:27.021 --> 01:48:28.850
<v Speaker 3>in meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

2248
01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.360
<v Speaker 3>you can have it in a very subtle way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't have,</v>

2249
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:34.423
<v Speaker 3>doesn't summon him at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly doesn't immediately summon </v>

2250
01:48:36.321 --> 01:48:38.840
<v Speaker 3>some radical change in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2251
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:40.850
<v Speaker 3>the feeling tone of your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be,</v>

2252
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:43.680
<v Speaker 3>it can be as simple as just looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>water bottles,</v>

2253
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:44.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2254
01:48:44.491 --> 01:48:45.241
<v Speaker 3>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2255
01:48:45.241 --> 01:48:47.390
<v Speaker 3>it's just the lights are on and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no center.</v>

2256
01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.673
<v Speaker 3>Now you can feel that for just a moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not recognize it's revolutionary </v>

2257
01:48:53.361 --> 01:48:56.570
<v Speaker 3>significance because it doesn't come </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the upwelling of,</v>

2258
01:48:56.930 --> 01:49:00.710
<v Speaker 3>of rapture or bliss that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>associate with good meditation or,</v>

2259
01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:05.690
<v Speaker 3>or a psychedelic experience or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or ordinary religiosity like feelings of</v>

2260
01:49:05.691 --> 01:49:09.350
<v Speaker 3>love while chanting or singing in church</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2261
01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:10.520
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

2262
01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Or a football match where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2263
01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.740
<v Speaker 1>there are various contexts in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>these states can be achieved.</v>

2264
01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:16.873
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose what I believe is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be looking to create the state's </v>

2265
01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:20.954
<v Speaker 1>prioritize the states and give more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people access to them through whatever </v>

2266
01:49:25.701 --> 01:49:26.540
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2267
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:27.403
<v Speaker 1>certainly I don't agree with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition of an ideology of Dogma on </v>

2268
01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:32.840
<v Speaker 1>anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2269
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:36.800
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell and I think the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles to that are a huge centralized</v>

2270
01:49:36.801 --> 01:49:39.530
<v Speaker 1>power bases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then without the removal of that,</v>

2271
01:49:39.531 --> 01:49:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how there could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

2272
01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we,</v>

2273
01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:44.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2274
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much we disagree about </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

2275
01:49:46.891 --> 01:49:47.724
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>

2276
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all a matter of alternatives.</v>

2277
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.641
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:52.474
<v Speaker 3>democracy seems impressively broken to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and capitalism seems impressively </v>

2279
01:49:56.561 --> 01:49:59.890
<v Speaker 3>broken to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except the alternatives seem worse.</v>

2280
01:49:59.891 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2281
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.360
<v Speaker 3>this is a Winston Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2282
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2283
01:50:06.581 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 3>but I think we just need to find our </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2284
01:50:09.611 --> 01:50:12.160
<v Speaker 3>but just recognize what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

2285
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:13.143
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to grab whatever lever or </v>
<v Speaker 3>dial we can get within reach to change </v>

2286
01:50:17.591 --> 01:50:22.520
<v Speaker 3>the human experience in predictably </v>
<v Speaker 3>benign and ultimately positive way.</v>

2287
01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:23.363
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel much fear in life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel afraid much like in your </v>

2288
01:50:26.891 --> 01:50:28.360
<v Speaker 3>tummy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in your brain?</v>

2289
01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.880
<v Speaker 3>It's more in my brain than it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2290
01:50:34.881 --> 01:50:35.541
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no it's not.</v>

2291
01:50:35.541 --> 01:50:37.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I can't feel fear I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2292
01:50:37.610 --> 01:50:42.380
<v Speaker 3>but the things that I worry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly as a matter of,</v>

2293
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being someone who talks and writes about</v>

2294
01:50:45.051 --> 01:50:45.884
<v Speaker 3>these things is not indicative of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling adrenalized and fearful all the </v>

2295
01:50:52.461 --> 01:50:52.881
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2296
01:50:52.881 --> 01:50:54.050
<v Speaker 3>it's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can,</v>

2297
01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:55.213
<v Speaker 3>you can worry about new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that actually the thing that </v>

2298
01:50:57.651 --> 01:50:58.484
<v Speaker 3>worries me most again at the brain level</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the greatest risks to human </v>

2299
01:51:04.011 --> 01:51:08.360
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing are hard to take seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2300
01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the people who think,</v>

2301
01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 3>who professionally think about nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>war and,</v>

2302
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:13.834
<v Speaker 3>and new and the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>proliferation and people like William </v>

2303
01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:17.061
<v Speaker 3>Perry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2304
01:51:17.061 --> 01:51:20.310
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's close to 90 now.</v>

2305
01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.173
<v Speaker 3>He was 85.</v>

2306
01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:23.613
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2307
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.533
<v Speaker 3>these people think that we are at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most dangerous place we've been in the </v>

2308
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:32.630
<v Speaker 3>last 75 years with respect to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>likelihood of,</v>

2309
01:51:32.631 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 3>of a nuclear exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2310
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:37.120
<v Speaker 3>So as I could like think the Cold War is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only not over,</v>

2311
01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.750
<v Speaker 3>it is like from from Paris point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

2312
01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:44.470
<v Speaker 3>we are in another Cuban missile crisis </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2313
01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:47.420
<v Speaker 3>And nobody's worried about Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>

2314
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:48.293
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2315
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

2316
01:51:49.301 --> 01:51:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I think,</v>

2317
01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:53.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the possibility of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistake.</v>

2318
01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book I would,</v>

2319
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.903
<v Speaker 3>I would recommend your listeners read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which should make them suitably afraid </v>

2320
01:51:58.931 --> 01:52:01.960
<v Speaker 3>is Eric Schlosser's book command and </v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

2321
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:06.220
<v Speaker 3>which is just a story of how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>mishaps and how many,</v>

2322
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.353
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how haphazard our stewardship of these </v>

2323
01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.670
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapons has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2324
01:52:12.671 --> 01:52:13.504
<v Speaker 3>it's been by dent of sheer dumb luck </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we haven't nuked ourselves or </v>

2325
01:52:16.391 --> 01:52:18.250
<v Speaker 3>provoked a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an exchange between,</v>

2326
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:22.240
<v Speaker 3>between Russia and the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on just bad information,</v>

2327
01:52:22.450 --> 01:52:23.283
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2328
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2329
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.623
<v Speaker 3>but so what is worrisome here is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to spend more than five </v>

2330
01:52:29.801 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 3>minutes worrying about that on any given</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2331
01:52:31.810 --> 01:52:32.111
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2332
01:52:32.111 --> 01:52:32.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can worry,</v>

2333
01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I can worry a lot about totally trivial </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in my own life,</v>

2334
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:37.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2335
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.100
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my website goes down,</v>

2336
01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the field,</v>

2337
01:52:40.141 --> 01:52:40.974
<v Speaker 3>my feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of kind of moral emergency is at 11 </v>

2338
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like what the fuck is happening.</v>

2339
01:52:46.881 --> 01:52:48.220
<v Speaker 3>My website is down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

2340
01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2341
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to call the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2342
01:52:50.551 --> 01:52:51.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2343
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:53.900
<v Speaker 3>my website developers and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergency.</v>

2344
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet when talking about when,</v>

2345
01:52:58.011 --> 01:52:59.670
<v Speaker 3>when I hear that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who,</v>

2346
01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.513
<v Speaker 3>who make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their business to think about the </v>

2347
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:02.264
<v Speaker 3>prospect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole cities may be annihilated by </v>

2348
01:53:04.941 --> 01:53:05.774
<v Speaker 3>the biggest bombs in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I hear that they are more worried </v>

2349
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:11.960
<v Speaker 3>than they have ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

2350
01:53:11.961 --> 01:53:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes after we talk about this,</v>

2351
01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2352
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.113
<v Speaker 3>And that worries me is hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to have an appropriate </v>

2353
01:53:19.401 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 3>emotional response to what we think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>data show.</v>

2354
01:53:22.911 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And so it is with the suffering of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2355
01:53:25.281 --> 01:53:26.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it about the homeless person.</v>

2356
01:53:26.961 --> 01:53:29.780
<v Speaker 3>You can see on this sidewalk that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to be walking on.</v>

2357
01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:30.913
<v Speaker 3>But to hear that 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Los Angeles County are </v>

2358
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:35.150
<v Speaker 3>homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2359
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2360
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:40.100
<v Speaker 3>it's inconceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's hard to summon an inappropriate</v>

2361
01:53:40.101 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 3>emotional response.</v>

2362
01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is perhaps some,</v>

2363
01:53:44.970 --> 01:53:49.440
<v Speaker 1>we've been bull out of alignment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're capable of receiving,</v>

2364
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:54.470
<v Speaker 1>what we're can capable of transmitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's talking of sort of anthropology,</v>

2365
01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the bats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have been so extracted from</v>

2366
01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:00.270
<v Speaker 1>these conditions that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2367
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:03.210
<v Speaker 1>where you said we wouldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize what disease was.</v>

2368
01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.173
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

2369
01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.660
<v Speaker 1>we have become as gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a cheer,</v>

2370
01:54:06.661 --> 01:54:07.494
<v Speaker 1>some mounted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many obstacles that perhaps we have </v>

2371
01:54:09.811 --> 01:54:10.644
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are no longer living within a pallet </v>

2372
01:54:12.481 --> 01:54:15.780
<v Speaker 1>that is appropriate for this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammal.</v>

2373
01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:21.810
<v Speaker 3>But we also just have bugs in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardware and software that we are bad at</v>

2374
01:54:22.181 --> 01:54:24.850
<v Speaker 3>correcting for [inaudible] and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why,</v>

2375
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:28.270
<v Speaker 3>that's why again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic corrections,</v>

2376
01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:29.373
<v Speaker 3>you like good laws and good tax codes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and good governments and good </v>

2377
01:54:32.141 --> 01:54:36.130
<v Speaker 3>institutions I think will do much </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavier lifting for us.</v>

2378
01:54:36.131 --> 01:54:36.964
<v Speaker 3>Then all of us getting our heads </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight and keeping them straight day </v>

2379
01:54:40.391 --> 01:54:41.224
<v Speaker 3>after day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I made the example that I'll give </v>

2380
01:54:42.941 --> 01:54:45.700
<v Speaker 3>here is based on the work of Paul </v>
<v Speaker 3>Slovic,</v>

2381
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who found it.</v>

2382
01:54:47.451 --> 01:54:48.284
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a propensity for moral error that </v>

2383
01:54:49.691 --> 01:54:51.550
<v Speaker 3>is totally shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you tell people,</v>

2384
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:53.103
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them like the classics are to </v>

2385
01:54:54.461 --> 01:54:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Unicef Pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's you know,</v>

2386
01:54:56.230 --> 01:54:58.840
<v Speaker 3>one little girl in Sudan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2387
01:54:58.841 --> 01:55:02.410
<v Speaker 3>her name is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Jenny.</v>

2388
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2389
01:55:03.701 --> 01:55:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her parents were killed.</v>

2390
01:55:05.230 --> 01:55:08.620
<v Speaker 3>She needs your help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>$5 a day will keep her in school and all</v>

2391
01:55:08.621 --> 01:55:09.454
<v Speaker 3>the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2392
01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:13.510
<v Speaker 3>You tell that story with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifiable child peep,</v>

2393
01:55:13.511 --> 01:55:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you get the maximum response of </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion and,</v>

2394
01:55:16.001 --> 01:55:20.560
<v Speaker 3>and F and actual altruism from people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ask them how much they'll give every</v>

2395
01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.393
<v Speaker 3>month and you get their maximum number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you show that same girl to a </v>

2396
01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:27.820
<v Speaker 3>different group of people along with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother and you say,</v>

2397
01:55:27.821 --> 01:55:32.020
<v Speaker 3>here's Jenny and here's Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've suffered this horrible atrocity.</v>

2398
01:55:32.050 --> 01:55:34.060
<v Speaker 3>$5 a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go $5 a month,</v>

2399
01:55:34.061 --> 01:55:35.410
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll keep them in school,</v>

2400
01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.610
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2401
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:39.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the altruism and the,</v>

2402
01:55:39.161 --> 01:55:39.994
<v Speaker 3>and the self assessment of compassion </v>
<v Speaker 3>reliably goes down just more to the </v>

2403
01:55:44.131 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 3>scope of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2404
01:55:45.241 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same girl in the same boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you add 10,</v>

2405
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 3>it goes down further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes through the floor and if you add</v>

2406
01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:53.010
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>background statistics,</v>

2407
01:55:53.011 --> 01:55:56.790
<v Speaker 3>if you say this little girl Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got this terrible problem,</v>

2408
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:57.743
<v Speaker 3>you can help and there's a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand girls just like her in Sudan </v>

2409
01:56:00.601 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just</v>

2410
01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.410
<v Speaker 1>passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wash it.</v>

2411
01:56:03.411 --> 01:56:07.370
<v Speaker 1>That kind of apathy is a kind of despair</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of hope there's just no,</v>

2412
01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:07.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no</v>

2413
01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.220
<v Speaker 3>point in doing anything.</v>

2414
01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we have to correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

2415
01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Teleology of civilization then seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat broken.</v>

2416
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:19.300
<v Speaker 1>The idea that sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grow bigger and bigger states and as</v>

2417
01:56:19.301 --> 01:56:20.134
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a globally mandated </v>

2418
01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:23.053
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these would seem to be poor ideas like </v>

2419
01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:25.873
<v Speaker 1>what may work for human beings for the 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion is de centralization and to </v>

2420
01:56:30.741 --> 01:56:32.660
<v Speaker 1>achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve real change,</v>

2421
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:36.230
<v Speaker 1>where do you suppose the fulcrum will </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be applied?</v>

2422
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Who are the people for whom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 90,000</v>

2423
01:56:38.961 --> 01:56:41.200
<v Speaker 1>homeless and Little Jenny and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand others.</v>

2424
01:56:41.290 --> 01:56:42.123
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really a problem because their </v>

2425
01:56:43.371 --> 01:56:47.180
<v Speaker 1>system is operating precisely as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended to operate.</v>

2426
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all of us here again,</v>

2427
01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.900
<v Speaker 3>there are not that many bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2428
01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:53.003
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a default level of selfishness </v>

2429
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:00.173
<v Speaker 3>in virtually everyone all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that we have to figure out how to </v>

2430
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 3>game that and channel that successfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>toward more benign ends.</v>

2431
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2432
01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:13.740
<v Speaker 3>you what you want the perfect system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what capitalism promises but</v>

2433
01:57:13.741 --> 01:57:14.574
<v Speaker 3>doesn't deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is everyone selfishly seeking happiness </v>

2434
01:57:20.281 --> 01:57:21.114
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for themselves and prioritizing the </v>

2435
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 3>happiness of their families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their loved ones,</v>

2436
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:26.063
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe going out a few and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>extending that circle more and more as </v>

2437
01:57:30.901 --> 01:57:33.300
<v Speaker 3>they learn more and more about the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in the world.</v>

2438
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they'll never,</v>

2439
01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 3>they'll never extend that circle </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly or they'll,</v>

2440
01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:38.843
<v Speaker 3>or most people certainly won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you want is a system that </v>

2441
01:57:42.961 --> 01:57:43.794
<v Speaker 3>captures all of that energy in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that allows all boats or most boats to </v>

2442
01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:51.630
<v Speaker 3>rise with the same tide most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2443
01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.640
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2444
01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:54.533
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a perfect solution to all of </v>

2445
01:57:56.371 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 3>these zero sum and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2446
01:57:59.161 --> 01:58:02.520
<v Speaker 3>and positive some arrangements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2447
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:03.623
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's certainly better and worse </v>

2448
01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:06.630
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know,</v>

2449
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:07.493
<v Speaker 3>we know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know there's some bad ones on offer </v>

2450
01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:12.820
<v Speaker 3>that we don't want to experiment with </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and we want to refine our,</v>

2451
01:58:12.821 --> 01:58:13.654
<v Speaker 3>our current set of solutions so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>life gets better and better for </v>

2452
01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:18.600
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is,</v>

2453
01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:19.653
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can sound like a very despairing </v>

2454
01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:21.384
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but life has gotten better and better </v>

2455
01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:29.600
<v Speaker 3>for virtually everyone in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at the last century,</v>

2456
01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.313
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's something like 10% of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>now live in extreme poverty and 90% of </v>

2457
01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 3>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got 7 billion people,</v>

2458
01:58:38.851 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>90% of them are not in what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling extreme poverty.</v>

2459
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 3>The something like 150 years ago that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was flipped,</v>

2460
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it was 90 10 the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only,</v>

2461
01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:51.620
<v Speaker 3>it was 90% in extreme poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2462
01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:52.773
<v Speaker 1>I suppose again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they send the metric by which we judge </v>

2463
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>poverty and the metric by which we judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>human experience is something that could</v>

2464
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>be long debated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

2465
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:06.541
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what I'm interested in and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>the here I think we can cut his truth,</v>

2466
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:09.213
<v Speaker 1>truthful experience io at listen to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast you did once and like a with </v>

2467
01:59:12.251 --> 01:59:13.084
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect very much Jordan piece and it </v>

2468
01:59:14.591 --> 01:59:15.424
<v Speaker 1>got caught up along while on some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of semantic tangle and like so but what </v>

2469
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I feel is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2470
01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I am interested in my own sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>

2471
01:59:27.341 --> 01:59:32.341
<v Speaker 1>egotistical way in conveying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmit in love and change.</v>

2472
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:34.263
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the point where I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure needs to be applied if that's </v>

2473
01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:43.310
<v Speaker 1>even the right attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need it be combative.</v>

2474
01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me there's sort of the focus,</v>

2475
01:59:45.110 --> 01:59:45.943
<v Speaker 1>I think individual personal revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and personal salvation and I think he's </v>

2476
01:59:49.031 --> 01:59:49.864
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important component and the </v>

2477
01:59:51.081 --> 01:59:51.914
<v Speaker 1>introduction of ideas that go beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and materialism may be a </v>

2478
01:59:55.701 --> 02:00:00.200
<v Speaker 1>necessary spur for significant change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like rationalism,</v>

2479
02:00:00.201 --> 02:00:01.730
<v Speaker 1>materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead people to believe,</v>

2480
02:00:01.731 --> 02:00:04.550
<v Speaker 1>well we are just individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here for a short amount of time,</v>

2481
02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:05.593
<v Speaker 1>pleasure sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that just looking around </v>

2482
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be what is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to disengage people.</v>

2483
02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And then some of the examples you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>given about your human compassion,</v>

2484
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:15.731
<v Speaker 1>it seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2485
02:00:15.731 --> 02:00:16.564
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems very hard for people to access </v>

2486
02:00:19.101 --> 02:00:19.934
<v Speaker 1>love to access community and within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating system that currently have </v>

2487
02:00:23.531 --> 02:00:24.364
<v Speaker 1>bites.</v>

2488
02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.313
<v Speaker 3>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2489
02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:26.873
<v Speaker 3>We need more again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about our systems </v>

2490
02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:33.600
<v Speaker 3>and institutions that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2491
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:37.020
<v Speaker 3>just how good could a school be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2492
02:00:37.021 --> 02:00:39.930
<v Speaker 3>How good could entertainment be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How good could,</v>

2493
02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet be?</v>

2494
02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.193
<v Speaker 3>How good could smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good could social media be in terms </v>

2495
02:00:45.511 --> 02:00:48.240
<v Speaker 3>of leading us where we want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both,</v>

2496
02:00:48.241 --> 02:00:53.241
<v Speaker 3>both personally and interpersonally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we are at the beginning of,</v>

2497
02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:56.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2498
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.880
<v Speaker 3>perfecting those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>

2499
02:01:00.881 --> 02:01:03.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not that we'll reach perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

2500
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:04.263
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are obviously so </v>

2501
02:01:06.481 --> 02:01:11.100
<v Speaker 3>broken as they are now that we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how much better life would be</v>

2502
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:15.270
<v Speaker 3>if we got halfway to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the optimum.</v>

2503
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2504
02:01:17.671 --> 02:01:18.504
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2505
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:20.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2506
02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:22.483
<v Speaker 3>there's an immense amount of work to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the work will be done on the basis </v>

2507
02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.593
<v Speaker 3>of having insights into truth and having</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fact based discussion about the </v>

2508
02:01:31.701 --> 02:01:33.980
<v Speaker 3>consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2509
02:01:34.670 --> 02:01:36.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning any of these knobs.</v>

2510
02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:38.353
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris in the background about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the gallery to this small </v>

2511
02:01:41.511 --> 02:01:42.344
<v Speaker 1>facility that headspace the brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>app in spite of the contradictions of </v>

2512
02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>having existed in a consumer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological world,</v>

2513
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>which I would like to give props theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>was against the wall and that one,</v>

2514
02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2515
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.473
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

2516
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.313
<v Speaker 1>there ain't no wall to sort of send me </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote doc Brown in the transcendent </v>

2517
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the you,</v>

2519
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:02.923
<v Speaker 1>all one or glorious oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been holding up like ice </v>

2520
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>skating goes like 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 minutes for 120 minutes now,</v>

2521
02:02:10.701 --> 02:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>just that duration of the podcast right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now for me,</v>

2522
02:02:13.311 --> 02:02:14.144
<v Speaker 1>it's been a great joy and a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and a rigorous intellectual </v>

2523
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:19.580
<v Speaker 1>workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I speak with you and I'm enjoying it</v>

2524
02:02:19.581 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harrison most grateful.</v>

2525
02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:22.484
<v Speaker 1>And I've returned to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations are what's likely to </v>

2526
02:02:27.591 --> 02:02:28.424
<v Speaker 1>produce change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly conversations between </v>

2527
02:02:30.111 --> 02:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>people that don't automatically agree on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most significant issue.</v>

2528
02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm incredibly grateful to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise.</v>

2529
02:02:35.271 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
