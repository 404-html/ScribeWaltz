1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe in God?</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I believe in God with often they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean like we are supported by </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible forces.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>That kind.</v>

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I love that video about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 2>your grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You obviously love him.</v>

7
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 2>He said maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he still the most important male</v>

8
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>figure in your life?</v>

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>He's probably the only important male </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of my life,</v>

11
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>which is a strong statement to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about right.</v>

12
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a good female figures in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life?</v>

13
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I try to be that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I come from a very sort of broken crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

16
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that sort of known of your </v>

17
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.574
<v Speaker 2>uncles had been incarcerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come from a family where the </v>

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 2>crime is part of the story.</v>

19
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not nine of them,</v>

20
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.494
<v Speaker 1>but five of the nine of them all spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>some time in prison and that sort of </v>

21
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.173
<v Speaker 1>trickled down and I have cousins that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have spent time in prison and it was </v>

22
00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>just a part of my story growing up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't particularly unique.</v>

23
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.193
<v Speaker 1>It's so it's a weird thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the retrospect like that seems </v>

24
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>normal to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to go see your uncle in</v>

25
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

26
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.093
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do normal for a lot of </v>

27
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not extraordinary.</v>

28
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which really lets you know that you can </v>

29
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:16.264
<v Speaker 1>create different simulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different pockets of society and until </v>

30
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you travel outside of it to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different experience.</v>

31
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You think it's just the norm.</v>

32
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 2>When did that happen for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did your life transition from?</v>

33
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 2>What was your early determining context </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what was the thing that should change</v>

34
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 2>first few candies?</v>

35
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was always sort of an alien </v>

36
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.044
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my mother says all the time when I </v>

37
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just weirded out by me.</v>

38
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Like I never cried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always thought I could like </v>

39
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>understand them as a baby in the crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really bizarre.</v>

40
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>But the earliest thing that I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the first play date,</v>

41
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.063
<v Speaker 1>which was in kindergarten class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was five years old and there was a </v>

42
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.424
<v Speaker 1>girl named Lindsey to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was this blonde girl with blue eyes </v>

43
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>and we became fast friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

44
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we had reading class </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and her mother invited me over </v>

45
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:09.111
<v Speaker 1>for a play date and I went to her house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just shocked that people lived</v>

46
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>in the way that she lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lived in the suburbs.</v>

47
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>She had a massive house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had this Victorian concept room.</v>

48
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>She had a nanny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a playroom and I was.</v>

49
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I just remember being shocked that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was even a part of life because prior to</v>

50
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>obviously I existed within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my family.</v>

51
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I lived in a really small apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and my two sisters shared a room in a</v>

52
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:37.401
<v Speaker 1>low income housing a building and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just blew my mind.</v>

53
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think when I was a really small kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was already considering like,</v>

54
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.684
<v Speaker 1>how is this asking the question at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is important in order to get the </v>

55
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.074
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could people be living such </v>

56
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:52.491
<v Speaker 1>different lives and you either take two </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches to it.</v>

57
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.053
<v Speaker 1>You either say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate rich people because they live </v>

58
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:56.964
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I want to become a rich person and </v>

59
00:02:58.471 --> 00:02:59.304
<v Speaker 1>learn how to live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've always been curious about </v>

60
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>success and wanted to learn how to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful myself,</v>

61
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>so my path was somewhat natural in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

62
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never hated rich people.</v>

63
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird thing to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people demonize the rich.</v>

64
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.413
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he hates a terrible emotion </v>

65
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

66
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

67
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.493
<v Speaker 1>you harvest it internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you hate someone you hate that </v>

68
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

69
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.523
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you always been an aspirational even </v>

70
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.044
<v Speaker 1>when you were a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it sounds to me from what little </v>

71
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you've told me already that you sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had an unusual emotional state,</v>

72
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.730
<v Speaker 1>that you were sort of quite an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent person.</v>

73
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you're.</v>

74
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even watching you,</v>

75
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I've watched quite a lot of your videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the interviews.</v>

76
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>You're very powerful person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got driven on you.</v>

77
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>You've got a strong presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.183
<v Speaker 1>and I've always had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my teachers hated me growing up </v>

79
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.283
<v Speaker 1>because I was just extremely assertive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think think about the functional </v>

80
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.383
<v Speaker 1>educated.</v>

81
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.473
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I like to say that I was self </v>

82
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>educated because you don't learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in school.</v>

83
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>You learn propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to function in society and</v>

84
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>the way that the government and society </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants you to function.</v>

85
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like to think that because I always</v>

86
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.124
<v Speaker 1>had to earn my way through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents couldn't afford to put me </v>

87
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.294
<v Speaker 1>through school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents started paying for anything </v>

88
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.473
<v Speaker 1>when I turned 14 years old I was kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my house and I was living with a </v>

90
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those kids,</v>

91
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.453
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of was self taught and I was </v>

93
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>constantly pushing back against </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary authority.</v>

94
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Arbitrary Authority mean that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the teacher and I say,</v>

95
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>go left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go left.</v>

96
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

97
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>tell me why I should go left.</v>

98
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I need to like to be a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of reasoning behind this.</v>

99
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always a critical thinker my </v>

100
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

102
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.603
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to university for a couple of </v>

103
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>years and then dropped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I'm so smart because I didn't</v>

104
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:51.754
<v Speaker 1>go to university and do that thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that your auto didact self </v>

105
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>educated person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was your reading?</v>

106
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

107
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a small kid,</v>

108
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.584
<v Speaker 1>I loved books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get totally lost in novels and </v>

109
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of fiction novels that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up on.</v>

110
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I was reading books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre.</v>

111
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean to be like a five year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

112
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight year old reading Nora Roberts </v>

113
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:14.134
<v Speaker 1>and like Dean Koontz and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to get wrapped up in fiction </v>

114
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:17.344
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>

115
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.183
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that helped obviously in terms of </v>

116
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>just my vocabulary and ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

117
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I was always reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a big reader or total dweeb.</v>

118
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cool in school,</v>

119
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>but it was a total dweeb at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

120
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.494
<v Speaker 1>and I remember racing even when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth grade to read the Harry Potter </v>

121
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.834
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those people that was in </v>

122
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>line waiting for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a disaster now,</v>

123
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but issue,</v>

124
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean her books are very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a politically,</v>

125
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:42.904
<v Speaker 1>she a total disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should stick to fiction because she </v>

126
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't,</v>

127
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>she really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sorry.</v>

128
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>She's wonderful worlds she created </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

129
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.060
<v Speaker 1>People just get lost inside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.023
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start reading political chat </v>

131
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>and you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get,</v>

132
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>get comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be in here for,</v>

133
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.</v>

134
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>They're not leaving until we agree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything.</v>

135
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I have you in a mega hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing it already,</v>

136
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:16.361
<v Speaker 1>but just very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

137
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

138
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.443
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start reading I guess non </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction until I got interested in </v>

139
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>nonfiction and politics and things of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nature.</v>

140
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And then I started reading Milton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friedman and Dr Thomas Soul.</v>

141
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't understood it.</v>

142
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.713
<v Speaker 2>Any of these references,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even those fictional ones was </v>

143
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.303
<v Speaker 2>reading when you're a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

144
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 2>will these Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these modern wars,</v>

145
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the recent ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:41.104
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economists and Dr Thomas Soul is </v>

147
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Speaker 1>also an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:47.071
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

149
00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a black economist,</v>

150
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:49.474
<v Speaker 1>which was the most important reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could've done because he just </v>

151
00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:59.131
<v Speaker 1>completely makes you understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are using and manipulating you,</v>

152
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the color of your skin.</v>

153
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And he just uses fact based logic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and world history.</v>

154
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And we'll bring you backward and forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and show you a basic theses like,</v>

155
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make you think that because you're </v>

156
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you're behind.</v>

157
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tells us that's not true,</v>

158
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Ottoman Empire,</v>

159
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks owned the bank,</v>

160
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>so it was a Turkish empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek zone,</v>

161
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:22.264
<v Speaker 1>the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're doing the best in that </v>

162
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just goes through,</v>

163
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world history and just shows you pretty </v>

164
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:28.504
<v Speaker 1>much all of the fallacies and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional arguments that are made and </v>

165
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.900
<v Speaker 1>basically tells you if you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead in life and start from nothing,</v>

166
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.913
<v Speaker 1>you have to abandon these arguments is </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional arguments and understand the </v>

167
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 1>facts and how it is that you can start </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and get ahead.</v>

168
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I chose to do.</v>

169
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.903
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there were certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical ideas that may have a </v>

170
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>truth to them when practiced on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of the individual,</v>

171
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.023
<v Speaker 2>but when translated to a social scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more complex and break down a </v>

172
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

173
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's Utopian because it takes it</v>

174
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 2>about individualism and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

175
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

176
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.414
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

177
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.830
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel kindness is your powerful person.</v>

178
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.933
<v Speaker 2>You're driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've come from nothing and you've </v>

179
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.214
<v Speaker 2>achieved a lot in your life and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me at least not to suggest this to </v>

180
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.300
<v Speaker 2>you because you've not directly said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or I'm actually.</v>

181
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I think you maybe have directly say </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like,</v>

182
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can do this,</v>

183
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now.</v>

184
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:24.964
<v Speaker 2>But that kind of for me is to deny your </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique abilities and your unique </v>

185
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 2>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even having drive the willingness</v>

186
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.463
<v Speaker 1>to work hard is in itself an endowment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why don't say you can do what I've </v>

187
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

188
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't say that you're going to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that I've done.</v>

189
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I actually hope that my kids never had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live through,</v>

190
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or see the things that I had to see </v>

191
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I want that?</v>

192
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>

193
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.383
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my children to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go see their uncle's in prison or to </v>

194
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>struggle financially and not to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to afford to go on a school trip.</v>

195
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.004
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for you to understand how to </v>

196
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>become successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

197
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but what I do demand is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned a victim mentality,</v>

198
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is,</v>

199
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 1>has become a cancer in our society to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mintel.</v>

200
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.283
<v Speaker 1>Give me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us some background on it because </v>

201
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>some people won't know what you mean.</v>

202
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just the oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>

203
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to say I deserve more </v>

204
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Speaker 1>because I'm more oppressed than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

205
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you might say,</v>

206
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I might say that I'm more pressed than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because I'm black and you're white,</v>

207
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:28.794
<v Speaker 1>so instantly I'm more pressed and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve more than my voice should be </v>

208
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we say,</v>

209
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:33.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a male and I'm a,</v>

210
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so instantly I deserve even more because</v>

211
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm a woman and you're a male and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more oppressed,</v>

212
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 1>which is totally a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>and I should have my voice heard louder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you keep going gay,</v>

214
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 1>straight and they've created all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little,</v>

215
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.423
<v Speaker 1>these little pockets and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out who is the most depressed </v>

216
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.294
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be a disabled black </v>

217
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>female gay person would probably be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

218
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 1>If you want to win the oppression </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics,</v>

219
00:09:58.921 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

220
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.413
<v Speaker 1>And everyone should fawn over you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you say should count and </v>

221
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:03.520
<v Speaker 1>should matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

222
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.373
<v Speaker 1>it's absolute crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The victim mentality is what's stopping </v>

223
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>most people from getting from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b should be mean.</v>

224
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 1>But if I imagine a guy disabled and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are gay,</v>

225
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:19.030
<v Speaker 1>disable a black female female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I imagine that person,</v>

226
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it and I'm sure there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>even within that category,</v>

227
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's lots of lots of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of variety.</v>

228
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.393
<v Speaker 1>But when I think of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the world and the people who </v>

229
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 1>have the most influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not many of them are gay,</v>

230
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black females.</v>

231
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not a by the way a kind of,</v>

232
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

233
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.921
<v Speaker 1>where we're starting from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the difference between MSNBC</v>

234
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.243
<v Speaker 1>and Breitbart and trump and Obama is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>small as to be irrelevant for my </v>

235
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>political standpoint.</v>

236
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Speaker 1>These are what I would call the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

237
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what I'm trying to illustrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candice,</v>

238
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.373
<v Speaker 1>is that it's relative for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of those people are offering the </v>

239
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:06.774
<v Speaker 1>kind of social change that's required to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the systems that human beings </v>

240
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.123
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now like so what is yours to me is that </v>

241
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:14.514
<v Speaker 1>you have a tremendous faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability of the individual to create </v>

242
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>their own destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you?</v>

243
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:21.624
<v Speaker 1>Because you've lived it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that that's applicable </v>

244
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.340
<v Speaker 1>to all individuals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 100 percent if it,</v>

245
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>unless there are of course policies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that are preventing you from doing</v>

246
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.704
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are not in America at this moment </v>

247
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.954
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually were forming our own </v>

248
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>oppression by buying into the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

249
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.123
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that harmed the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>community the most or these last six </v>

251
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>years has been the welfare state.</v>

252
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening in France right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

253
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

254
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Giving handouts and creating a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and not creating a,</v>

255
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentives for people work,</v>

256
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.274
<v Speaker 1>which is what people want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the human spirit that governments </v>

257
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.364
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to understand that policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are socialists don't seem to </v>

258
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't account for the human spirit.</v>

259
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>We want to be valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to create.</v>

260
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you remove all of that,</v>

261
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you end up with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and with a variety of problems</v>

262
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:10.384
<v Speaker 1>and you can pick a ton of problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the black community that I'm </v>

263
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>trying to reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all starts with abandoning the victim</v>

264
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.154
<v Speaker 1>mentality and the government tells me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I should feel bad for myself for </v>

265
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.124
<v Speaker 1>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman and being black and make me </v>

266
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>understand that I'm behind in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

267
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 1>those are the racists.</v>

268
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me that I need to feel bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>about myself.</v>

269
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that way and they sit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they insist that you do so.</v>

270
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.333
<v Speaker 1>The greatest challenge and and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most fun I think that I have on these </v>

271
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:33.814
<v Speaker 1>college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want to see if a black </v>

272
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:36.634
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see who the real racists </v>

273
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you.</v>

274
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Tell people that as a black person you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see yourself as a victim.</v>

275
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>They lose their goddamn minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they hate me.</v>

276
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Read the articles about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call me a neo Nazi.</v>

277
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Neo Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a supporter of white supremacy because I</v>

279
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 1>believe that I can do whatever I want in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life because I have confidence.</v>

280
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>What does that tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they're rushing to smear me because</v>

281
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I believe that black people can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>without government handouts.</v>

282
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>It means that they insist that black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do it with government handouts.</v>

283
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

284
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 1>she has a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't make any policies.</v>

285
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not running for office.</v>

286
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Why does it bother them so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

287
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel you,</v>

288
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

289
00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 2>where is compassion and love in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy?</v>

290
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Where is the place for that?</v>

291
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

292
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody,</v>

293
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.663
<v Speaker 1>compassion to me is not telling people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should be coddled because of </v>

294
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the color of their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's,</v>

295
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:32.494
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

296
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that over and like a button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what will,</v>

297
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.013
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought like say my background </v>

298
00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:45.911
<v Speaker 2>doesn't sound nearly as challenging as </v>
<v Speaker 2>your call from him prior to celebrity,</v>

299
00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:50.210
<v Speaker 2>which I'm imagining there anything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to know about me,</v>

300
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but the prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I grew up in an ordinary household,</v>

301
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:57.380
<v Speaker 2>single parent family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom was sick a lot when I was a kid.</v>

302
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I had have intermittent access with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

303
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively regular.</v>

304
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.174
<v Speaker 2>But like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents weren't together and then I </v>

305
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.634
<v Speaker 2>became a crack and heroin addict when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sort of in my late teens and I feel </v>

306
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:09.974
<v Speaker 2>that there are what I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel that there were social </v>

307
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:14.894
<v Speaker 2>factors there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I was from a different </v>

308
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:19.250
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had access to different resources that I</v>

309
00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 2>may have received.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychological,</v>

310
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.913
<v Speaker 2>spiritual input,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different points now like I'm not </v>

311
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:24.254
<v Speaker 2>complaining about my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got money and got good family and </v>

312
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:29.090
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really happy.</v>

313
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>But I think to deny social factors in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cultivation of the individual really</v>

314
00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 2>plays into the hands of the already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

315
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

316
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.353
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't deny those social </v>

317
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:41.554
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell people at the biggest problem </v>

318
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>facing the black community as father </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence.</v>

319
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 1>But that's being incentivized by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

320
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.153
<v Speaker 1>So the blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black single motherhood rate was 23 </v>

321
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:51.634
<v Speaker 1>percent in 19 sixties before welfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs were implemented today at 74 </v>

322
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.084
<v Speaker 1>percent in the black community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because they literally will give </v>

323
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:00.470
<v Speaker 1>a black mother more money from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government if the father doesn't live in</v>

324
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually really,</v>

325
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.813
<v Speaker 1>I really believe in a two parent home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can just look at the statistics </v>

326
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>to see that children are better off when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have two parents.</v>

327
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 1>But think about what's perpetuated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our media.</v>

328
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Think about radicalize feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do it without men.</v>

329
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.333
<v Speaker 1>F meant we hate men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I fight these concepts </v>

330
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>because what you're talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

331
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not what people are talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

332
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:19.124
<v Speaker 1>the political realm.</v>

333
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>They want to get rid of all of that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of more government,</v>

334
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>more government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more government.</v>

335
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become increasingly radicalized and</v>

336
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:25.904
<v Speaker 1>it's harming the individual and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>chances when you come from a two parent </v>

337
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 1>home versus a single parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

338
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.153
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tons of statistics that prove </v>

339
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>that what you're saying is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my compassion towards that is when I</v>

340
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:36.194
<v Speaker 1>go and I combat feminism right when I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I were a hymn to shirt to the Brett </v>

341
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Kavanaugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

342
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>hearings and tobacco because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the me too movement,</v>

343
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been radicalized.</v>

344
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:45.441
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

345
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:46.274
<v Speaker 1>it's a harmful feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like calling it feminism </v>

346
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:49.454
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a means for people to secure </v>

347
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:51.550
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

348
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.443
<v Speaker 1>and it's cloaked as feminism and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I exercise compassionate </v>

349
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.230
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>

350
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.213
<v Speaker 1>When I go fight for the first step backs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I understand that many people that </v>

351
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.544
<v Speaker 1>are in prison are in prison because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in that environment where they </v>

352
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any parents raising them.</v>

353
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 1>My mother grew up in group homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

354
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>and didn't graduate high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't end up in prison,</v>

355
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:11.774
<v Speaker 1>but she could have very well could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so will you exercise compassion by </v>

356
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:15.194
<v Speaker 1>having those conversations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the conversations that are </v>

357
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>being had at the political level or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>remote accessing compassionate.</v>

358
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that was exercising analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical thought and the intellect,</v>

359
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.154
<v Speaker 1>which I would never challenge you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your obviously very adept and very </v>

360
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 1>strong in each of those areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

361
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>let's go into different territory for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

362
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Am I right in thinking that you suffered</v>
<v Speaker 1>from anorexia?</v>

363
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Younger?</v>

364
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.023
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suffered from anorexia for about four </v>

365
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:43.431
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

366
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's your eating now?</v>

367
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably me,</v>

368
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 1>what the next year was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

369
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're an interesting person to talk</v>

370
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 1>to you about this because there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual component of Anorexia when,</v>

371
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.540
<v Speaker 1>when there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

372
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start,</v>

373
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>when you starve the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind.</v>

374
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why people do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fastings and many religions,</v>

375
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you starve the body,</v>

376
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>there's almost a mental clarity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes over.</v>

377
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I think becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicting for most people.</v>

378
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:10.814
<v Speaker 1>Like for me was never about weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for most people it's not about </v>

379
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:14.024
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

380
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>it's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

381
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:15.824
<v Speaker 1>when you learn about in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they tell you that it's usually a </v>

382
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of people trying to assert</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over their lives.</v>

383
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:21.524
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one thing you can control when </v>

384
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 1>you feel like there's chaos is what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in your mouth and your body.</v>

385
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was for me,</v>

386
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.593
<v Speaker 1>after going through a unique situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling that my whole life was out </v>

387
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just manifested as an eating disorder.</v>

388
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And I had it for four years on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

389
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you saw pictures,</v>

390
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.094
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was like 30 pounds skinnier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 40 pounds skinnier than I am </v>

391
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is insane if you get any help.</v>

392
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I helped myself,</v>

393
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

394
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:52.520
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was I going to go,</v>

395
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go talk to.</v>

396
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm a smart person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>

397
00:17:55.071 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know this I'm saying this as</v>

398
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.261
<v Speaker 1>a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:17:58.261 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Jordan peers don't have to tell me if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right or wrong.</v>

400
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:02.580
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that's got the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctorate for this stuff.</v>

401
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.583
<v Speaker 1>But I think that it's really hard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have a higher Iq to go get </v>

402
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:10.194
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not the a one time that I went to </v>

403
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was with my parents,</v>

404
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>my parents side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to try therapy.</v>

405
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>The woman was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just a total moron.</v>

406
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally everything that she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to say to me,</v>

407
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.503
<v Speaker 1>my family wasn't helpful and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that me feeling like I didn't find </v>

408
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:30.441
<v Speaker 1>someone that was smart in the chair </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably sort of turned me off.</v>

409
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 1>But if I had sat down with Dr Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson first,</v>

410
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I probably would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

411
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 1>therapy is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

412
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.371
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

413
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got better.</v>

414
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.443
<v Speaker 2>The therapy was ineffective because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've found the therapist </v>

415
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 2>intellectually and analytically inept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't just breeze into.</v>

416
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I just got better because anorexia that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

417
00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:56.971
<v Speaker 2>very serious mental condition and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got friends that are suffering with that</v>

418
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:01.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's like almost I'm a drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recovering drug addict.</v>

419
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Like my own experience with addiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

420
00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:07.990
<v Speaker 2>is precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to deal with a deficit.</v>

421
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.573
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my belief is that it's a spiritual </v>

422
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.423
<v Speaker 2>deficit or lack of connection in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction with the material world </v>

423
00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and inability to allied into systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that seem erroneous,</v>

424
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 2>duplicitous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless,</v>

425
00:19:24.221 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 2>and are powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Need for some values,</v>

426
00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:29.050
<v Speaker 2>some spirit now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're not like,</v>

427
00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I feel like perhaps there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparable.</v>

428
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 2>The addiction is underscored by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say some certain universal's,</v>

429
00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 2>whether it's an eating disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual obsessions or,</v>

430
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.220
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 2>like obviously drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

432
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:50.110
<v Speaker 2>what I'm curious about is how that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be resolved,</v>

433
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.340
<v Speaker 2>how that would end with that.</v>

434
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Identify the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what caused me to illustrator,</v>

435
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.183
<v Speaker 1>I actually realized that I went through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this experience in high school that was </v>

436
00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:00.430
<v Speaker 1>classified as a hate crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

437
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a racist lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

438
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider them racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that was part of the reason</v>

439
00:20:06.731 --> 00:20:07.564
<v Speaker 1>that I caused an eating disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they left me racist voicemails and </v>

440
00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>then it became the sore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't consider that.</v>

441
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.473
<v Speaker 1>But that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make an individual but </v>

442
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 1>individual racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

443
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Can you do something without having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry a label for the rest of your life?</v>

444
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Can you say something off pudding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure you've done many times or</v>

445
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make homophobic,</v>

446
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.450
<v Speaker 1>does that make you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make you a sexist?</v>

447
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Can you do an app without having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry a label for the rest of your life?</v>

448
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not actually that.</v>

449
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:41.150
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just for this situation,</v>

450
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no forgiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to them?</v>

451
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.780
<v Speaker 1>That was my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

452
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.611
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did something.</v>

453
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It was remarkably stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were a nice tool.</v>

454
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 3>They left racist voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they said,</v>

455
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.243
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can say those words on </v>

456
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:52.984
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can name words your way through </v>

457
00:20:53.751 --> 00:20:54.161
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

458
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:58.660
<v Speaker 3>so like a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a feather,</v>

459
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 3>that dirty and word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna.</v>

460
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Put a bullet in the back of your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Martin Luther King.</v>

461
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible stuff.</v>

462
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I brought up a lot of African Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why did they do that?</v>

463
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares about the why.</v>

464
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 3>They just want to rush and call people </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

465
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still adjusting and here's how I got</v>

466
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 3>through my name's sorter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this thing gets happened to,</v>

467
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 3>gets taken out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets blown up.</v>

468
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.734
<v Speaker 3>It's on the front page of a newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly people are discussing you </v>

469
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:24.470
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

470
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 17 years old.</v>

471
00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 3>It's what people want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't want that to be,</v>

472
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my high school story,</v>

473
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 3>especially getting ready to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

474
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.333
<v Speaker 3>And your personal experience with </v>
<v Speaker 3>reappropriate it and told back to you </v>

475
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.430
<v Speaker 3>that you used as an object in someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else's narrative.</v>

476
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.680
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

477
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.523
<v Speaker 3>and then now called the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible racism before you experienced </v>

478
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to challenge you and I'm going</v>

479
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.550
<v Speaker 3>to challenge you on on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to challenge you on that.</v>

480
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.403
<v Speaker 3>Have happened from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to challenge you on that </v>

481
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.410
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you say that's terrible.</v>

482
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Racism that I experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

483
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a couple of high school kids for.</v>

484
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.510
<v Speaker 3>There were four kids in that car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them I knew,</v>

485
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.390
<v Speaker 3>three had never laid eyes on me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>never even seen me.</v>

486
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 3>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the youngest person in the car was 14.</v>

487
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Are Really gonna label a 14 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist for the rest of their life.</v>

488
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course it sells.</v>

489
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 3>Newspapers write this terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in our town and people suddenly</v>

490
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:18.934
<v Speaker 3>are invested in and moms are suburban </v>
<v Speaker 3>moms or writing letters to the editor </v>

491
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:22.650
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

492
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.523
<v Speaker 3>in this because nothing happens and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have something that's happened and </v>

493
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 3>the media took what should have been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching moment for children.</v>

494
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why'd they do it?</v>

495
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they had their first beer.</v>

496
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 3>One guy in the car is upset with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I stopped hanging out with him.</v>

497
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:35.614
<v Speaker 3>Was I got my first boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said we're going to call her and </v>

498
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 3>leave her a voicemail and she's black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

499
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 3>You gave a drunk drunk 14 year olds a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

500
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no emotional connection.</v>

501
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever talks about technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how easy it is to be mean now.</v>

502
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.683
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that to my face or they </v>

503
00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 3>have called me those things to my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

504
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to be mean in person,</v>

505
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 3>but leaving a voicemail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say anything to this cup.</v>

506
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Russell brand.</v>

507
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll say anything goes God Damn Cup into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russell brand.</v>

508
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is what I'm saying.</v>

509
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:04.624
<v Speaker 3>So people don't even consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were the first generation that had </v>

510
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>

511
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:09.360
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

512
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not pronouncing instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange website.</v>

513
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram,</v>

514
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.513
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone on a penny farthing bicycle </v>

515
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.493
<v Speaker 3>guard passed onto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds better that way we should be </v>

516
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 3>calling it instagram on the emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last syllable of instagram.</v>

517
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming with you on that journey now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that that was a traumatic</v>

518
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Speaker 3>incident and your response to it was nrx</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

519
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which free to me,</v>

520
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.353
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's admirable that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to be forgiving of the </v>

521
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>perpetrators of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admittedly we're kids,</v>

523
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.873
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a few things that I think </v>

524
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>and also agree with you</v>

525
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.903
<v Speaker 2>that the media capitalize on certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of hysterical and like a short </v>

526
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.610
<v Speaker 2>kind of hysterical attitude because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sells,</v>

527
00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is a genuine.</v>

528
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're actually really shocked.</v>

529
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.350
<v Speaker 2>At least racism happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we in the,</v>

530
00:23:58.351 --> 00:24:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that the energy that moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers around or no,</v>

531
00:24:00.851 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with you on that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

532
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.273
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that your being forgiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that incident and willing to let go </v>

533
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:10.874
<v Speaker 2>of that incident doesn't negate for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the particular language </v>

534
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they used may have been socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>resourced.</v>

535
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I just want to ask you about some things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ever happened to me the other day.</v>

536
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

537
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.350
<v Speaker 2>like there's a English black footballer </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Raheem Sterling.</v>

538
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Bloody good football actually soccer </v>
<v Speaker 2>player in your language.</v>

539
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

540
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.360
<v Speaker 2>someone called him a Eva Manc see unt </v>
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

541
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 2>See unt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

542
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pissed off about it.</v>

543
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Raheem Sterling got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

544
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:43.431
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

545
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy lost his job,</v>

546
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.260
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 2>we can discuss that aspect of it in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

548
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.570
<v Speaker 2>But like what I was like in Raheem </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sterling,</v>

549
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.660
<v Speaker 2>like instagrammed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I instagrammed instagram.</v>

550
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Instagram's a post saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's two stories.</v>

551
00:25:01.071 --> 00:25:01.904
<v Speaker 2>One is about like a black footballer by </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his Mama House once about White </v>

552
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Footballer bind his Mama House and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one about the white football,</v>

553
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like lovely young white football up</v>
<v Speaker 2>by his mom house.</v>

554
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 2>And the one about the black football a </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

555
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 2>at his momma house is flash little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bastard buys mom house,</v>

556
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.164
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm Raheem Sterling </v>

557
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.503
<v Speaker 2>Brilliantly like sort of selects these </v>
<v Speaker 2>two stories about the same subject and </v>

558
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:23.024
<v Speaker 2>notes how one is rendered as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like negatively and one is rendered </v>

559
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:27.344
<v Speaker 2>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stanley says that this is racially </v>

560
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:30.344
<v Speaker 2>motivated now.</v>

561
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think I need beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A black person to say yeah.</v>

562
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.413
<v Speaker 2>That for me aligns with the way that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media functions in perpetuating certain </v>

563
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:41.144
<v Speaker 2>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whilst you say the perpetuation of </v>

564
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:43.664
<v Speaker 2>the victim narrative is disempowering </v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans or perhaps even black </v>

565
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 2>people were white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fully sure of how,</v>

566
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breadth of your philosophy,</v>

567
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

568
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.273
<v Speaker 2>what I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a myopic to suggest that the powerful </v>

569
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:03.440
<v Speaker 2>cultural narratives and historic </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression don't play a part in people's</v>

570
00:26:03.441 --> 00:26:04.274
<v Speaker 2>current economic poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whilst the way out of that I would </v>

571
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:11.360
<v Speaker 2>accept except would be into a individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>culpability and individual will.</v>

572
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone has that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone has that.</v>

573
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has that drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that power.</v>

574
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.893
<v Speaker 2>Some people need support now with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>role of the state and the veracity of </v>

575
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>the state's intentions are certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I question as well.</v>

576
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Do I think that the Democrat Party or </v>
<v Speaker 2>super kind,</v>

577
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 2>wonderful people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

578
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>we have a look at the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that work out?</v>

579
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 2>How was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how were African Americans treated under</v>

580
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:34.634
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

581
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>so we've got the evidence that date is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

582
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.530
<v Speaker 2>It's neither party worked particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

583
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but for me to deny that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact of social,</v>

584
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 4>economic and historic conditions on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual experience of paypal.</v>

585
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:49.404
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that those conditions are not affected </v>

586
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 4>by race for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>

587
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.411
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first off,</v>

588
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 4>I want to go to your two articles </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you use the word myopic.</v>

589
00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

590
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 4>you used a sample sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sample of two articles to come up with</v>

591
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 4>this great conclusion is every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>

592
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.473
<v Speaker 4>I understand that as every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>article about a black person buying a </v>

593
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:11.890
<v Speaker 4>house negative or did you find one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't going to do a comparison?</v>

594
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.863
<v Speaker 4>Now hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every single article of a white person </v>

595
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 4>buying a house positive or did you find </v>
<v Speaker 4>article of white person positive and now</v>

596
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:20.004
<v Speaker 4>you've used as to say at this means that</v>
<v Speaker 4>every single white person and article </v>

597
00:27:21.951 --> 00:27:22.784
<v Speaker 4>articles written about is true or false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a problem with this data set and </v>

598
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 4>this is what we see over and over again.</v>

599
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.013
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that they do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they extract the 16 unarmed black men </v>

600
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:32.400
<v Speaker 4>that are shot and killed by police </v>
<v Speaker 4>officers every year.</v>

601
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Forget to mention that there's a higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>rate for white people.</v>

602
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 4>You did the exact same thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't stand.</v>

603
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.040
<v Speaker 4>This was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found,</v>

604
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.943
<v Speaker 4>I found two articles at universal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Russell brand calm down because </v>

605
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:47.994
<v Speaker 4>firstly it was rocking sterling faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That counts for times that by a </v>

606
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 4>thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

607
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.753
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is is you get a number </v>

608
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:57.054
<v Speaker 4>and you can blow him out because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably better with media creates </v>

609
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.583
<v Speaker 4>simulation one side by side and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>universal truth here on the Russell </v>

610
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 4>brands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to me for a second please.</v>

611
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.443
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is is that whilst of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course all of us can construct </v>

612
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 4>narratives by selecting information that</v>
<v Speaker 4>supports our idea,</v>

613
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Raheem Sterling didn't do this in a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Saturday.</v>

614
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Someone screams racial abuse him on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next day.</v>

615
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

616
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:25.914
<v Speaker 4>I'm not surprised because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I experienced a lot of this </v>

617
00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:30.830
<v Speaker 4>treatment at a subtler level in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>white arm.</v>

618
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.673
<v Speaker 4>How did in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is he's personal experienced that </v>

619
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Ryan is recounting and then we look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the information and say,</v>

620
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.143
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it seem to be like for young </v>

621
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 4>black men in England is are there any </v>
<v Speaker 4>commonalities economically?</v>

622
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Are there any judicial or criminal </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues where there's a commonality?</v>

623
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.330
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that these narratives </v>
<v Speaker 4>being cherry picked,</v>

624
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.313
<v Speaker 4>there is also the date of receipt on </v>
<v Speaker 4>incarceration of young black men in </v>

625
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:57.144
<v Speaker 4>America because we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproportionately commit crimes in </v>

626
00:28:59.101 --> 00:28:59.934
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we not supposed to be arrested </v>

627
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 4>because we're all doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're counted your.</v>

628
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 4>You're extracting that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they do it without saying,</v>

629
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:06.444
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the economic conditions in </v>

630
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we're missing this.</v>

631
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 4>You're missing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree that we have been,</v>

632
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.243
<v Speaker 4>that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are economically depressed as black </v>

633
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm talking about,</v>

634
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 4>what we disagree on is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

635
00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economically depressed because we bought</v>

636
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 4>into the myth that government is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to fix our problems.</v>

637
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 4>We have disproportionately been voting </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Democrats for the last 60 years.</v>

638
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all of our problems are because Latin</v>

639
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 4>American Emma's proportionately welfare </v>
<v Speaker 4>programs,</v>

640
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 4>we disproportionately might disagree on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the solution.</v>

641
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we're.</v>

642
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.210
<v Speaker 4>I guess we're not moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

643
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 4>So I guess this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not disagreeing.</v>

644
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ignoring the fact</v>

645
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.963
<v Speaker 3>that there have been economically </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed and the economical depression </v>

646
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 3>then leads to higher crime rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with all of that.</v>

647
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we disagree on or perhaps what </v>

648
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:52.270
<v Speaker 3>people disagree with me on a lot are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions for it.</v>

649
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.343
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I point out the fact of how we got </v>

650
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.633
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't understand how we got here </v>

651
00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:00.190
<v Speaker 3>in terms of buying into the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government was gonna fix everything,</v>

652
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.603
<v Speaker 3>this victim mentality it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've been able to sell the </v>

653
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 3>easiest person to sell social.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some too.</v>

654
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:08.230
<v Speaker 3>As a wealthy person a go to Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

655
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.073
<v Speaker 3>they're like the number one socialist </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they felt guilty about it's </v>

656
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

657
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they feel guilty about their</v>

658
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:14.391
<v Speaker 3>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

659
00:30:14.391 --> 00:30:15.224
<v Speaker 3>you are the perfect stereotype of </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that I could get to grow </v>

660
00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 3>government with Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these poor people.</v>

661
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Look at how well you live.</v>

662
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Look at this podcast studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you feel bad as a white,</v>

663
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 3>straight male that all of this is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>

664
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

665
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should I do?</v>

666
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Use your platform to tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is wrong and that you,</v>

667
00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 3>you become the voice that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows people to grow government.</v>

668
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:36.574
<v Speaker 3>And what it does is it decreases </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for black Americans </v>

669
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.463
<v Speaker 3>opportunities with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your normal argument of normal </v>

670
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to.</v>

671
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually just having prefer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>smiling.</v>

672
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Start using that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some rules,</v>

673
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got me all fired up because I'm not.</v>

674
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a liberal.</v>

675
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>

676
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm an east coast into cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

677
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the centralized government.</v>

678
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:08.763
<v Speaker 3>But where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I feel you and I are gonna </v>

679
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.420
<v Speaker 3>disagree is on the level of extending </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion to give out hugs.</v>

680
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

681
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 3>How would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you,</v>

682
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.700
<v Speaker 3>how would you learn it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately you order.</v>

683
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.820
<v Speaker 3>How would you give up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

684
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also want to ask you,</v>

685
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when your,</v>

686
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:28.984
<v Speaker 3>what is your solution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we both agree that the sort of </v>

687
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 3>centrist left and you can't call those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people come in and you really can't.</v>

688
00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

689
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 3>the difference between them is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>negligible between wow,</v>

690
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.160
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Democrats is negligible in terms</v>

691
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:45.994
<v Speaker 3>of like a holistic global philosophy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>inculcate and spread real meaningful </v>

692
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:53.040
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

693
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

694
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.210
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you as a conservative,</v>

695
00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 3>a believer in conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the solution?</v>

696
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.173
<v Speaker 3>We weren't limited government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want free markets and in a society </v>

697
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 3>where people can help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had that.</v>

698
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 3>We've got that now mania.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First off it is working in America.</v>

699
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.120
<v Speaker 3>This is why this is the lowest rate ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>for black unemployment is right now in a</v>

700
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump who is allegedly the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist president.</v>

701
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.460
<v Speaker 3>If you read the Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

702
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Like he's so racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so racist.</v>

703
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 3>While he sucks at racism because black </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans are doing so much better,</v>

704
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.273
<v Speaker 3>there's been a 400 percent increase in </v>
<v Speaker 3>black owned businesses because there's </v>

705
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

706
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:27.090
<v Speaker 3>he's making sure that there are actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>

707
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.461
<v Speaker 3>Do I believe in them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

708
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Those sort of figures when people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

709
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 3>When governments go and we found out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the unemployment note after Scott,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sponsored initiative where you can start</v>

713
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 3>your own business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some bullshit thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you know what?</v>

716
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:55.010

<v Speaker 3>the Democrat Pie,</v>

717
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.410
<v Speaker 3>how can you believe in the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>Party differences?</v>

718
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Anybody ever heard me say vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican?</v>

719
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have it.</v>

720
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm an.</v>

721
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

722
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:09.374
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I vote based on the candidate and the </v>

723
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.470
<v Speaker 3>candidate that I believe in is Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>

724
00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 3>And let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's neither Republican or Democrat,</v>

725
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 3>which was so interesting to watch you on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the view.</v>

726
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've watched you before.</v>

727
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch your youtube channels </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I even was conservative.</v>

728
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch all of your thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

729
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's really smart.</v>

730
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:26.204
<v Speaker 3>He's really got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand the problem with the </v>

731
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:28.334
<v Speaker 3>establishment and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you didn't realize was that </v>

732
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 3>trump was antiestablishment because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know why you get fooled by wealth.</v>

733
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.113
<v Speaker 3>You think wealth automatically makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment doesn't obviously he's on </v>

734
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:38.774
<v Speaker 3>establishment or you wouldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire mainstream media on two parties </v>

735
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:43.970
<v Speaker 3>that were opposing him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the antithesis of all of that.</v>

736
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 3>And he came and he slammed all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any one.</v>

737
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.293
<v Speaker 3>So I'm a trump supporter and if people </v>
<v Speaker 3>call that trump lickin's like a portion </v>

738
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:51.914
<v Speaker 3>of the Republican party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had to run on either one </v>

739
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 3>ticket or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran as a Republican.</v>

740
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Trump is by no means he calls it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swamp for a reason.</v>

741
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the truly that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment is opposed to trump?</v>

742
00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:04.644
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That media noise and static and Shamash </v>

743
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

744
00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:10.314
<v Speaker 2>I read the stuff about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is the president of United </v>

745
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.900
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you really think he would do</v>

746
00:34:15.901 --> 00:34:20.901
<v Speaker 2>for vulnerable ordinary people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you not think that a certain,</v>

747
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.280
<v Speaker 2>like the commercial and capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>society does create huge hierarchies and</v>

748
00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:32.520
<v Speaker 2>pyramids that lead most people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not most people.</v>

749
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.573
<v Speaker 2>A significant percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population to not have access to </v>

750
00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:38.730
<v Speaker 2>sufficient resources and create systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are run.</v>

751
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

752
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.780
<v Speaker 3>If if you're saying to me that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>some person is less driven than me,</v>

753
00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I was able to accomplish more and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>rewarded for it.</v>

754
00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:47.260
<v Speaker 3>That's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

755
00:34:47.261 --> 00:34:48.094
<v Speaker 3>that's not unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as we are provided the same </v>

756
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.940
<v Speaker 3>opportunities which in America our </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is.</v>

757
00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:54.070
<v Speaker 3>If you work hard and you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work hard,</v>

758
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.280
<v Speaker 3>you will be rewarded by system because </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people do.</v>

759
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism is an economic model that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifts people out of poverty.</v>

760
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.253
<v Speaker 3>Socialism does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's killed 100 million people in the </v>

761
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.740
<v Speaker 3>last 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Post capitalism like that.</v>

762
00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:09.370
<v Speaker 3>After they bowed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism like just 10 years ago,</v>

763
00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:12.610
<v Speaker 3>capitalism about the biggest lump of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communism in history.</v>

764
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Lucky it just was completely state </v>
<v Speaker 3>sponsored.</v>

765
00:35:15.341 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 3>The whole things artificially inflate </v>
<v Speaker 3>your system surviving by the merits that</v>

766
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:22.320
<v Speaker 3>espouses survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about,</v>

767
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.273
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about it in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about corruption and </v>

768
00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:28.444
<v Speaker 3>bail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should have been </v>

769
00:35:28.571 --> 00:35:28.990
<v Speaker 3>bailed out.</v>

770
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.380
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>

771
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

772
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.730
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right,</v>

773
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.930
<v Speaker 3>because that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism,</v>

774
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:35.764
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't true should have happened </v>

775
00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have let them go under.</v>

776
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I believe the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've all wasted.</v>

777
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:46.550
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people that paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baylor had their houses reclaim the have</v>

778
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 3>had their houses foreclosed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't get to be angry.</v>

779
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:51.054
<v Speaker 3>You won't get an argument from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that Donald Trump's going </v>

780
00:35:52.991 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 3>to address that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to.</v>

781
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Goldman Sachs was shutting down banks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've given these people,</v>

782
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately he wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president have seen now.</v>

783
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 3>And do you think he's not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit and run on that?</v>

784
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

785
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.190
<v Speaker 3>but what he is going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

786
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 3>philosophies basically in alignment with</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism is what we're talking about.</v>

787
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that I'm fully </v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

788
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

789
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about your says an </v>

790
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:15.474
<v Speaker 3>economic model of capitalism is the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>proven model that lifts people out of </v>

791
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 3>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I agree with that.</v>

792
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.800
<v Speaker 3>But that was about when the banks food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrible.</v>

793
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism doesn't do that.</v>

794
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

795
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think America is America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What made America America?</v>

796
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 3>What you talking about when you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

797
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 3>do you think there is one thing called </v>
<v Speaker 3>America underneath a flag,</v>

798
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 3>like we're like UPI a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is America,</v>

799
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 3>the America of poor prenatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the America of rich people.</v>

800
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of American sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of American America.</v>

801
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It is proven that if you make good </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices,</v>

802
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:47.364
<v Speaker 3>if you stay out of trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have children out of </v>

803
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:51.920
<v Speaker 3>wedlock and you have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will moral code.</v>

804
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.880
<v Speaker 3>That's it and you'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

805
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 3>That's all you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the interim,</v>

806
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.513
<v Speaker 3>you're in a part of a school system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sells you a thousand ways that you're </v>

807
00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.453
<v Speaker 3>being victimized and people as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to going into work are wearing pussy </v>

808
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:05.040
<v Speaker 3>hats and protesting a fair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reelection.</v>

809
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I do agree those aspects of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>education system,</v>

810
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:10.380
<v Speaker 3>they're hugely disempower aganda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

811
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.273
<v Speaker 3>Like disempowering to ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we do disagree on some of the </v>

812
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 3>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now see,</v>

813
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 3>imagine this like you when you were like</v>
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>

814
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:20.664
<v Speaker 3>You've got the Anorexia and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't get therapeutic help because </v>

815
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you're too bloody clever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do in the instance of a,</v>

816
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

817
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.120
<v Speaker 3>a woman or go that suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 3>anorexia and it doesn't have your drive.</v>

818
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 3>What happens in this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a person.</v>

819
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you agree that requires help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion,</v>

820
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>support,</v>

821
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 3>and who do you propose should provide to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

822
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully her parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if her parents,</v>

823
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:49.560
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the government's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just create programs for anorexics to</v>

824
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:50.750
<v Speaker 3>go to places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>

825
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.653
<v Speaker 3>if an anorexic seeks help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six therapeutical help and they have to </v>

826
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>go so bad.</v>

827
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.690
<v Speaker 3>If the government did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

828
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so ridiculous idea,</v>

829
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 3>but it just depends on bailing out </v>
<v Speaker 3>banks.</v>

830
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we bail out some anorexia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Bailing out the banks.</v>

831
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.323
<v Speaker 3>The government is not God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are not the solution to all your </v>

832
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Families,</v>

833
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 3>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends,</v>

834
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 3>things of that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People forgot about that whole thing.</v>

835
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:16.981
<v Speaker 3>That happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

836
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Where like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the girl going to go?</v>

837
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.463
<v Speaker 3>Does she have parents?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anyone before you start </v>

838
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 3>worshiping the government to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to do?</v>

839
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.243
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any money in my account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a government program that will </v>

840
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 3>fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to do?</v>

841
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 3>I have anorexia is Erica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's wrong with the world.</v>

842
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 3>People don't remember light before </v>
<v Speaker 3>government was.</v>

843
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm astonished by is your belief that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the government is.</v>

844
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.200
<v Speaker 4>He's so friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Benevolence,</v>

845
00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:47.930
<v Speaker 4>go to one that wants to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in that machine.</v>

846
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Empowering conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to grow it.</v>

847
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.110
<v Speaker 4>You don't walk around with their binders</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'll do inspection.</v>

848
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You agree with that?</v>

849
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.370
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not my thing.</v>

850
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't have polished anorexic programs </v>
<v Speaker 4>for government.</v>

851
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:10.190
<v Speaker 4>We just created from a list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're touching.</v>

852
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Taxis are going up considerably for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuddly,</v>

853
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:14.884
<v Speaker 4>cozy anorexia program and we need a </v>
<v Speaker 4>further 10 percent for little putting </v>

854
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 4>them pie truck epics shut down in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dumps.</v>

855
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.673
<v Speaker 4>Heroin all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this used to be a thing communities </v>

856
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.103
<v Speaker 4>used to not think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This individualistic culture is in </v>

857
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.374
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Destroying the principles are spiritual </v>

858
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.043
<v Speaker 4>human level of community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you not think when people see this </v>

859
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 4>economic inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this disparity?</v>

860
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about height in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>little rich friend,</v>

861
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Lola,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Belle or wherever it was.</v>

862
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:46.650
<v Speaker 4>You went round and see her nanny and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what infuriated by but for,</v>

863
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 4>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one day I'll have my own nanny.</v>

864
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.803
<v Speaker 4>Do you not think that economic </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality creates in a human being a </v>

865
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 4>sense of injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of unfairness?</v>

866
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.473
<v Speaker 4>Because people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what Kandis that 90 percent </v>

867
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.440
<v Speaker 4>of people that are rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know why they're rich?</v>

868
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.780
<v Speaker 4>They was born rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to tell you something.</v>

869
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I think that economic disparity creates </v>
<v Speaker 4>that feeling,</v>

870
00:40:04.751 --> 00:40:05.584
<v Speaker 4>but at a fundamental understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 4>economics can tell you know that most </v>

871
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:11.830
<v Speaker 4>people that are rich are born rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not like there's a tiny minority of</v>

872
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:12.664
<v Speaker 4>people that are like you that come from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a poor background and managed to </v>

873
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 4>overcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what's a pro I problem.</v>

874
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:18.034
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed with a lot of great people </v>
<v Speaker 4>is they've sort of belief that their </v>

875
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:24.640
<v Speaker 4>greatness is something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>replicated and I don't think it can.</v>

876
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I believe in the individual you don't</v>

877
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.753
<v Speaker 4>believe are differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the primary goal of the individual </v>

878
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 4>should be to serve the community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

879
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:37.981
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe that the primary goal </v>
<v Speaker 4>of individual fields,</v>

880
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 4>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>

881
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.340
<v Speaker 4>you're just counting the human spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm saying that's all there is.</v>

882
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you a quick no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not in a humanity.</v>

883
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.730
<v Speaker 4>Think of animals in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even have to go to humanity.</v>

884
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 4>We can just think about animals in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild.</v>

885
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:51.520
<v Speaker 4>What is our human instinct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

886
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to make sure that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this block is fed?</v>

887
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Before you feed yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you go around and say,</v>

888
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.363
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you had breakfast this morning at </v>

889

<v Speaker 4>if you have an excess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're going to do the humans.</v>

892
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.283
<v Speaker 4>Human condition in our incentives are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be to want to help you mold </v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

900
00:41:18.761 --> 00:41:19.594
<v Speaker 4>First and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about literally point </v>

901
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.631
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

902
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:23.291
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>

903
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 4>One percent of the world is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

904
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what are they preaching?</v>

905
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.983
<v Speaker 4>What do they want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Socialism so that nobody else has the </v>

906
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to become what they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>become.</v>

907
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.040
<v Speaker 4>They're are the ones that are pushing.</v>

908
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.133
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>George Soros doesn't want socialist </v>

909
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:38.894
<v Speaker 4>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the </v>

910
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want socialist policies.</v>

911
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.523
<v Speaker 4>They want to make sure that no one else </v>
<v Speaker 4>has the opportunity to get to language </v>

912
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 4>because what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what my socialism looks like,</v>

913
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.873
<v Speaker 4>tight Jeff Bezos as well from him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except for a reasonable stipend for him </v>

914
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 4>to live on something that you can have </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 million a year or something,</v>

915
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 4>tax Amazon to the ground so that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

916
00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 4>so the rich people pay for 85 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the taxes.</v>

917
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:09.110
<v Speaker 4>You think they should pay for even more?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that's fact.</v>

918
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 4>That's fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

919
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The top 10 percent pay for 85 percent of</v>

920
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:16.784
<v Speaker 4>all the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people say they're going to raise </v>

921
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 4>their taxes more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

922
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 4>how much more should we just say just </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for all the taxes.</v>

923
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 4>I say I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is no.</v>

924
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:24.704
<v Speaker 4>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were about to use an example from </v>

925
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 4>the natural world and I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

926
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:30.974
<v Speaker 4>I was going to say the instinct and when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in when you're in the natural </v>

927
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 4>world is that you feed your family </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

928
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:39.360
<v Speaker 4>You're not the idea that social goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the natural order are we're,</v>

929
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.203
<v Speaker 4>we're in a world of sort of accumulation</v>
<v Speaker 4>and access and I don't think he's even </v>

930
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder about.</v>

931
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:45.734
<v Speaker 4>So if I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you could say where do you draw </v>

932
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 4>the line?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm like,</v>

933
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.690
<v Speaker 4>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got money now.</v>

934
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not poor anymore and I'm not going </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

935
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:53.684
<v Speaker 4>I'll just take everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that I do agree with </v>

936
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:57.224
<v Speaker 4>when I see you like sort of right wing </v>
<v Speaker 4>commentators talk like they talk about </v>

937
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.380
<v Speaker 4>people that are in a image from the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

938
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.253
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you put some refugees in your </v>

939
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:04.640
<v Speaker 4>house?</v>

940
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.473
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you give up your money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason is because people are </v>

941
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:08.624
<v Speaker 4>selfish and in all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a kind of battle between some </v>

942
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:13.740
<v Speaker 4>of my impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Candice are,</v>

943
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 4>I just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want pleasure and fun and I don't</v>

944
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 4>care about anything except myself that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in me as strong,</v>

945
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 4>but I personally think I don't feel good</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I lived that way.</v>

946
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:29.120
<v Speaker 4>There are consequences for me and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were consequences for other others.</v>

947
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.013
<v Speaker 4>So I kind of want to live within systems</v>
<v Speaker 4>that encourage collective and communal </v>

948
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 4>values instead of we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>theft.</v>

949
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we don't have to go out demanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people give up.</v>

950
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Their stuff is theft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it sounds pretty.</v>

951
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:42.104
<v Speaker 4>When you say storage incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now when the government comes in demand </v>

952
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.250
<v Speaker 4>to someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you keep translating what I'm saying.</v>

953
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not helping me,</v>

954
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about that.</v>

955
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>You're translating what I'm saying into </v>
<v Speaker 4>rhetoric that you can argue with.</v>

956
00:43:56.361 --> 00:44:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Create a straw man of my words as we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know that that's.</v>

957
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying.</v>

958
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I'm not espousing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>values of big government.</v>

959
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there's any </v>
<v Speaker 4>political party that currently exists in</v>

960
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 4>any way represents my views.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just asking if in politics,</v>

961
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:15.164
<v Speaker 4>both personally and collectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's room for a little more </v>

962
00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:20.780
<v Speaker 4>compassionate and love on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whilst I agree with your,</v>

963
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:21.231
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

964
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

965
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.843
<v Speaker 4>that there was something easy to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fetishize about individual achievements </v>

966
00:44:26.191 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 4>that let in your own case or wherever we</v>
<v Speaker 4>see greatness.</v>

967
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 4>We can't take that example of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability of the individual</v>

968
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 3>to overcome adversity to condemn people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that haven't been able to.</v>

969
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 3>But where is there a role then for </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion and kindness?</v>

970
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's a big government </v>
<v Speaker 3>and take away from your politics.</v>

971
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:45.210
<v Speaker 3>So my thing is that the cock of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation could be,</v>

972
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.340
<v Speaker 3>should be completely separate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans give $500,</v>

973
00:44:48.341 --> 00:44:50.500
<v Speaker 3>billion in charity every single year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

974
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 3>It has been proven that when you lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tax rate,</v>

975
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:53.814
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you government stays out of our </v>

976
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:55.734
<v Speaker 3>paycheck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually give more that we're </v>

977
00:44:57.091 --> 00:44:57.924
<v Speaker 3>inclined to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have more money and you're able </v>

978
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:00.144
<v Speaker 3>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you want to give and you want </v>

979
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 3>to help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the government is saying,</v>

980
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.850
<v Speaker 3>we're going to tax your business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're successful,</v>

981
00:45:04.851 --> 00:45:07.800
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get taxed more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the incentive for you to want to</v>

982
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:08.720
<v Speaker 3>jump in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Build a business?</v>

983
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 3>If you know that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>penalized for it,</v>

984
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be penalized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

985
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 3>That's why we believe in limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

986
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 3>I say we obviously I work for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization turning point USA.</v>

987
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about winning banding and </v>

988
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Turning Point USA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're launching in the UK,</v>

989
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 3>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what this whole trip is about.</v>

990
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.593
<v Speaker 3>Launching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning point and like turning point is </v>

991
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.643
<v Speaker 3>what do you want us to turn to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We as conservative principles taught in </v>

992
00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 3>the school system because the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning this lolly Dolly,</v>

993
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:35.784
<v Speaker 3>merry go round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world's going to be purple and and </v>

994
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:38.064
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to have lollipops in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>school systems and then possibly from </v>

995
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:41.934
<v Speaker 3>your podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I haven't watched enough </v>

996
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 3>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the and it's just not.</v>

997
00:45:45.451 --> 00:45:45.930
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

998
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it's the truest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

999
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.743
<v Speaker 3>the economic model of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of letting people find success because </v>

1000
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:52.080
<v Speaker 3>they're willing to work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't want to work hard,</v>

1001
00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:53.700
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in that.</v>

1002
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.481
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1003
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:55.314
<v Speaker 3>what about the person doesn't have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive or should economic systems govern </v>

1004
00:45:58.411 --> 00:45:59.244
<v Speaker 3>the way that we live our lives?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is there not room for people to be </v>

1005
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:02.574
<v Speaker 3>different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he a person who values should be </v>

1006
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:06.900
<v Speaker 3>distilled into what's called the natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>market?</v>

1007
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:07.734
<v Speaker 3>You can't make that go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't make that go away no matter </v>

1008
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.054
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any time in the history of the world </v>

1009
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:15.820
<v Speaker 3>where there hasn't been some give and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some take the you cannot.</v>

1010
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.150
<v Speaker 3>You cannot do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't make that go away.</v>

1011
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.163
<v Speaker 3>There's no magic wand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can wave that's going to make human </v>

1012
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 3>incentives and what happens in humanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>go away.</v>

1013
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how rich or how poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>society is.</v>

1014
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.390
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be take.</v>

1015
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 3>People are going to create natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>markets.</v>

1016
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have three apples.</v>

1017
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you two apples if you give me </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1018
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean that it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the way the world works.</v>

1019
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.543
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have certain natural impulses to try </v>

1020
00:46:40.851 --> 00:46:41.684
<v Speaker 3>it and to cooperate as opposed to where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I are arguing for sypher sleigh </v>

1021
00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.500
<v Speaker 3>and passionately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Candice is on the front of a lot.</v>

1022
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.613
<v Speaker 3>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you that there are no </v>

1023
00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>social and economic factors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribute,</v>

1024
00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:59.004
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the phenomena of poverty and </v>

1025
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 3>persecution of African Americans or </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like in this country.</v>

1026
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I think the experience of being a Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably difficult because of the way</v>

1027
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Islam is reported about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that,</v>

1028
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:13.884
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that there's this thing </v>

1029
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:16.134
<v Speaker 3>called terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that in itself is somewhat </v>

1030
00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:19.434
<v Speaker 3>underwritten by the colonial project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you sort of deny that history </v>

1031
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:23.081
<v Speaker 3>has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1032
00:47:23.081 --> 00:47:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not denying that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just denying that I live in history.</v>

1033
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't live in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to prison.</v>

1034
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a variant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

1035
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.973
<v Speaker 3>This is what people</v>

1036
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 4>harp on that and this is why they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to focus on this.</v>

1037
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 4>When you're in school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at what happened.</v>

1038
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 4>That's why you're oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1039
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:35.824
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black people were actually outpacing </v>

1040
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 4>white Americans in the 19 fifties under </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Crow.</v>

1041
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.793
<v Speaker 4>In terms of economic growth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until we implemented the welfare </v>

1042
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:45.034
<v Speaker 4>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were outpacing them were there were </v>

1043
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 4>businesses because our families were </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1044
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 4>There was the divorce rates isn't what </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

1045
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:51.700
<v Speaker 4>People were married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our families were together.</v>

1046
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 4>We had jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have starting businesses.</v>

1047
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather did better than my father</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

1048
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.853
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather grew up in a segregated </v>

1049
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 4>south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did he do that?</v>

1050
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Because there wasn't all of this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>

1051
00:48:01.451 --> 00:48:02.284
<v Speaker 4>He never took welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't all this government </v>

1052
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:04.204
<v Speaker 4>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started his own business and that is </v>

1053
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:06.394
<v Speaker 4>how you create a successful individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grandfather never ever once </v>

1054
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 4>considered himself to be a victim.</v>

1055
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:10.623
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't think as you play the victim </v>

1056
00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anecdotal examples of individual.</v>

1057
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1058
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you that our system of </v>
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

1059
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:18.664
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can realistically </v>
<v Speaker 4>argue that the removal of welfare will </v>

1060
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:22.294
<v Speaker 4>make people go on to become a gauguin </v>
<v Speaker 4>now because I think they're all you can </v>

1061
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.540
<v Speaker 4>say because it's not anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1062
00:48:26.541 --> 00:48:28.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sign arguing.</v>

1063
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:28.903
<v Speaker 4>If black people were doing better under </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim crow economically than we're doing </v>

1064
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:31.900
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is that possible?</v>

1065
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Explain it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to learn.</v>

1066
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I think the same way that you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have an automatic impulse to</v>

1067
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:39.004
<v Speaker 4>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we also have an automatic </v>

1068
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:41.464
<v Speaker 4>impulse to help one another and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what maybe it's happened over the </v>

1069
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1070
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:47.403
<v Speaker 4>hundred years perhaps is part of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a post colonial thing is that there's </v>

1071
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:51.814
<v Speaker 4>been such disparity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such bifurcation of world that there's </v>

1072
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.843
<v Speaker 4>like an impoverished class that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgotten and I would say the deeply </v>

1073
00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:01.384
<v Speaker 4>underserved for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not qualified to talk on the issue </v>

1074
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 4>of race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me intuitively,</v>

1075
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 4>a lot of what you say is God.</v>

1076
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.373
<v Speaker 4>I know that some black people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>really offended by it and hurt by and </v>

1077
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 4>feel that is a denial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't qualified to talk about race?</v>

1078
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Because I've had no personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being a black person.</v>

1079
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's ever used the n word.</v>

1080
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean you can't qualify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about race.</v>

1081
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Talk about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matter of fact,</v>

1082
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean 90 percent of the things I say </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just making up as I go along,</v>

1083
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:29.953
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1084
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 4>but my fact is my factories is the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that I don't know about other female</v>

1085
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:34.624
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I know what it's like to </v>

1086
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:36.154
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do know what it's like to feel </v>

1087
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 4>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do know it's like to feel,</v>

1088
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:39.394
<v Speaker 4>not heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do know what it's like to feel </v>

1089
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:44.650
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable and I do feel as a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can be quite rapacious,</v>

1090
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 4>quite greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite individualistic.</v>

1091
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.003
<v Speaker 4>But when I live within systems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>encourage those aspects of my nature by </v>

1092
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:51.694
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1093
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 4>you make your own luck in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're willing to work hard,</v>

1094
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 4>you can become anything no matter where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're from.</v>

1095
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.213
<v Speaker 4>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my life journey has been that from an </v>

1096
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 4>ordinary working class family in Essex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>single parent family,</v>

1097
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 4>and now whoop de Doo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm rich,</v>

1098
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.200
<v Speaker 4>but that has not left me thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you everyone else.</v>

1099
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 4>But it's not like it's so I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to drive.</v>

1100
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:12.490
<v Speaker 4>I want to drive this point home because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1101
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 4>You used to be more in on the Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 4>scene in La,</v>

1102
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.313
<v Speaker 4>but this is why when these leftist </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians want to sell these ideas </v>

1103
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:20.704
<v Speaker 4>that are essentially just going to do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure that nobody has an </v>

1104
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:23.254
<v Speaker 4>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's married to the </v>

1105
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they turned to Hollywood because it's so</v>

1106
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>easy to make you feel guilty.</v>

1107
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.963
<v Speaker 4>I'm not them guy anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so easy to make people like </v>

1108
00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:32.500
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could still say that you're.</v>

1109
00:50:32.501 --> 00:50:33.334
<v Speaker 4>You're in the sphere of influencers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood influence as you started your </v>

1110
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 4>career as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1111
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.104
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you could still say it's so easy to </v>

1112
00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 4>make them feel guilty because most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them aren't really politically savvy.</v>

1113
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:45.510
<v Speaker 4>They can't have even a discussion that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're having.</v>

1114
00:50:45.511 --> 00:50:46.344
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they know that they feel so guilty </v>

1115
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 4>about being wealthy that I can come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I can say to you,</v>

1116
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 4>feel guilty about being white because </v>
<v Speaker 4>people make them feel guilty.</v>

1117
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I'll been welcomed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand economics.</v>

1118
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 4>They don't realize that they provide </v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>

1119
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.303
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Kim Kardashian became Kim </v>

1120
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:00.921
<v Speaker 4>Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1121
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 4>should she feel guilty about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people are now employed because</v>

1122
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:04.790
<v Speaker 4>of the Kardashian Empire?</v>

1123
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 4>How many people are employed because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter?</v>

1124
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.333
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Jack Dorsey created twitter and </v>

1125
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.793
<v Speaker 4>they feel guilty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you feel you provide </v>

1126
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 4>opportunities for people to get jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As human beings,</v>

1127
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:17.984
<v Speaker 4>we should aspire to greater goals than </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply fulfilling a predetermined </v>

1128
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.453
<v Speaker 4>economic growth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I worshiping continually are the </v>

1129
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:30.190
<v Speaker 4>older of finance we must do better and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we must look for best solution.</v>

1130
00:51:30.501 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you do you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1131
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:33.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is it?</v>

1132
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:34.634
<v Speaker 4>Belief in God if it's not a century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the belief that underneath hatred is </v>

1133
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:39.044
<v Speaker 4>love and underneath the individual is </v>
<v Speaker 4>oneness and that what we do to one </v>

1134
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 4>another we do to ourselves and vice </v>
<v Speaker 4>versa,</v>

1135
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:48.940
<v Speaker 4>that we need to create systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflective of our benevolence.</v>

1136
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know if you want to be good and</v>

1137
00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:53.984
<v Speaker 4>you want to be benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can exercise that in your personal </v>

1138
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 4>life as well.</v>

1139
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.623
<v Speaker 4>You and I are discussing politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you've done is that you've blended </v>

1140
00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:01.550
<v Speaker 4>in your mind that politics and goodness </v>
<v Speaker 4>in oneness,</v>

1141
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:03.770
<v Speaker 4>all she'd go together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell No.</v>

1142
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.753
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no such thing as a good </v>

1143
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we want it limited.</v>

1144
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.790
<v Speaker 4>The idea that government is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>become corrupt when you exercise these,</v>

1145
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.743
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these practices of goodness and the and </v>

1146
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sell to the public,</v>

1147
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.313
<v Speaker 4>we're are going to be good for you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to extract all of your </v>

1148
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 4>dollars and everyone is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>equal.</v>

1149
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.873
<v Speaker 4>Equally poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredibly naive thing to say and I'm </v>

1150
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:22.634
<v Speaker 4>startled that you've said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that they want government to </v>

1151
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 4>be impeded because easier to make money </v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's huge deregulation.</v>

1152
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:30.344
<v Speaker 4>That's why there was the 2008 crash </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the previous 20 years they'd </v>

1153
00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:33.663
<v Speaker 4>been loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loads of the regulation under the </v>

1154
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 4>Clinton in her life for me.</v>

1155
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.041
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all,</v>

1156
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:37.874
<v Speaker 4>they all end up in the same basket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're admitting that government is </v>

1157
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 4>corrupt and yet you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is solution to solve crime.</v>

1158
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:46.660
<v Speaker 4>Government different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about God.</v>

1159
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.490
<v Speaker 4>You want me to talk to you because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually think that,</v>

1160
00:52:49.491 --> 00:52:50.324
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we are seemingly from so far </v>

1161
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:57.020
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there we have an an an odd unity in that</v>

1162
00:52:57.021 --> 00:53:01.580
<v Speaker 4>we both agree that government as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>currently exists is a order,</v>

1163
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to say unacceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ineffective,</v>

1164
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:05.980
<v Speaker 4>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolent.</v>

1165
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.003
<v Speaker 4>You think the solution is a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of government and you think the </v>

1166
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 4>solution is to give you more power to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the already powerful.</v>

1167
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I think the government only functioned </v>
<v Speaker 4>as administrative individual branches,</v>

1168
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 4>national corporation to the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1169
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never said give more individual,</v>

1170
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.590
<v Speaker 4>more powerful individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give up.</v>

1171
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give up all of my rights</v>

1172
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 3>to a government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's arbitrary.</v>

1173
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 3>That's going to tell me how to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tells me what to say.</v>

1174
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone's gonna take away </v>
<v Speaker 3>your rights.</v>

1175
00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 3>How could they what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what?</v>

1176
00:53:33.151 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm interested in,</v>

1177
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 3>either of you need to call anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are enough as you are.</v>

1178
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.963
<v Speaker 3>What I'm interested in is what I believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the government are the sort of </v>

1179
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 3>bureaucratic arm of corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transnational corporations,</v>

1180
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:46.494
<v Speaker 3>and I think like you look at sort of any</v>
<v Speaker 3>government that tries to impose serious </v>

1181
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:50.664
<v Speaker 3>restrictions on the way that Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade and the way that Amazon are tax </v>

1182
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 3>would suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't do that in this country.</v>

1183
00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:57.234
<v Speaker 3>Like when are you going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's talk of a sort of a more left </v>

1184
00:53:58.711 --> 00:54:01.740
<v Speaker 3>wing government getting into power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The city's flex his muscles,</v>

1185
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.890
<v Speaker 3>everyone starts to brick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1186
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit themselves to sort of terrified,</v>

1187
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:06.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1188
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.700
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it like a centralized bipartisan.</v>

1189
00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:10.623
<v Speaker 3>The Democratic governments as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently exist are meaningless and </v>

1190
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 3>ineffectual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with you there,</v>

1191
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my concern is,</v>

1192
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 3>is that we need to find new ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>curbing the power of big business.</v>

1193
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:22.104
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about some lovely bloody</v>
<v Speaker 3>flourish to making their way in life or </v>

1194
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:30.020
<v Speaker 3>people that are entrepreneurial that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>limited,</v>

1195
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.033
<v Speaker 3>but now that's why we like trump is he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>disruptive because he's talking about </v>

1196
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:35.064
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about Google should be </v>

1197
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 3>broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a monopoly.</v>

1198
00:54:36.691 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with monopolies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1199
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Google is a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a worldwide monopoly.</v>

1200
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I have said it vocally a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google should be broken up.</v>

1201
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Amazon is prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic.</v>

1202
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:45.624
<v Speaker 3>These are things that issues that trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>is tackling and that's why the </v>

1203
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 3>establishment with naive as Mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg,</v>

1204
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:53.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>testifying these,</v>

1205
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.533
<v Speaker 3>he starting to attack this because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>understands that what you're talking </v>

1206
00:54:56.491 --> 00:54:57.324
<v Speaker 3>about is real.</v>

1207
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 3>The Latin and the right combined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1208
00:54:59.211 --> 00:54:59.761
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1209
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I say I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>

1210
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swamp Republicans.</v>

1211
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm a or have a leftist who pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1212
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they care about people,</v>

1213
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:11.010
<v Speaker 3>but in reality of this extracting </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars and power for themselves as they</v>

1214
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:14.460
<v Speaker 3>grow government to make sure that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bureaucrats enrich their pockets.</v>

1215
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:16.043
<v Speaker 3>That's what trump is disrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for people to process that </v>

1216
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 3>because trump is wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is what he's doing.</v>

1217
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at every policy he's made in</v>

1218
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:23.454
<v Speaker 3>terms of all the activities implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is why there is a war on him and </v>

1219
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.083
<v Speaker 3>all out war in terms of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same is happening in other </v>

1220
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:30.294
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of populist movements are </v>

1221
00:55:30.971 --> 00:55:32.250
<v Speaker 3>starting to arise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1222
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.093
<v Speaker 3>and I support them in Italy and Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like most people who are wealthy </v>

1223
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.813
<v Speaker 3>because the vagina that he emerged from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he did very well on top of </v>

1224
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:44.280
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1225
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.150
<v Speaker 3>So I mean to describe what he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's built is,</v>

1226
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 3>is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1227
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.870
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't been paying and just maintain </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail before they find success.</v>

1228
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.050
<v Speaker 3>You really like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people fail because this is,</v>

1229
00:55:58.051 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 3>this is what I don't like either people </v>
<v Speaker 3>say because you fail.</v>

1230
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty funny.</v>

1231
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1232
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:06.790
<v Speaker 3>if the people that can enjoy trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for that means he's pointedly</v>

1233
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says things that everybody's thinking</v>

1234
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and it's calling out people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been impossibly corrupt.</v>

1235
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.970
<v Speaker 3>We're going to say lock her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary should be in prison.</v>

1236
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Most Americans feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What she did to Haiti alone,</v>

1237
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 3>what the Clinton Foundation did to Haiti</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone,</v>

1238
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 3>they should all be locked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no fan of the Clintons.</v>

1239
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the balls to say it.</v>

1240
00:56:23.921 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

1241
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 4>politician?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else's,</v>

1242
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the Clinton.</v>

1243
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the dynasty in the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1244
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't say these things.</v>

1245
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Trump just says it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all corrupt.</v>

1246
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 4>So you liked that you liked these as </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a rabble rouser.</v>

1247
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:37.600
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that I would concern me is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I feel that our,</v>

1248
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:38.434
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social systems will need to look beyond </v>

1249
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.833
<v Speaker 4>terrible handouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder it world where sort of your </v>

1250
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 4>ideology was realized as I'm starting to</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand as I listened to you,</v>

1251
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sort of the individual,</v>

1252
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:49.973
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on impeded unimpaired reaching for </v>

1253
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:54.214
<v Speaker 4>Nietzschean glory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens to people that are not in </v>

1254
00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Dow with the facilities to achieve that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because some,</v>

1255
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 4>we are existing on a spectrum as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

1256
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Some people just need a bit of help and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bit of love to tell the truth.</v>

1257
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 4>If I hadn't been helped again to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>treatment center,</v>

1258
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 4>I think I'll still be on drugs.</v>

1259
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.220
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't have other people helping me</v>
<v Speaker 4>to stay clean one day at a time,</v>

1260
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I think I might relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm held invisibly,</v>

1261
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.000
<v Speaker 4>held by relationships with people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are kind and compassionate to me.</v>

1262
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:22.893
<v Speaker 4>And if it wasn't presented as if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government shrinks as your friend just </v>

1263
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:27.583
<v Speaker 4>got out the government though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although you just set that someone's </v>

1264
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 4>going to have to break up these </v>
<v Speaker 4>monopolies and I don't know,</v>

1265
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.300
<v Speaker 4>you think it's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goldman Sachs government,</v>

1266
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 4>that's what this company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our country was founded upon.</v>

1267
00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Just accidentally call it a company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry we're keeping the best company</v>

1268
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:49.840
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

1269
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Britain was essentially just the sort of</v>

1270
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:56.130
<v Speaker 4>a front for the colonizing powers of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>east India tea company.</v>

1271
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.973
<v Speaker 4>And I believe in limited government that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that government should come </v>

1272
00:57:59.051 --> 00:57:59.870
<v Speaker 4>because we learned from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1273
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:00.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1274
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.080
<v Speaker 4>the 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late,</v>

1275
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.390
<v Speaker 4>late 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>

1276
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:04.303
<v Speaker 4>early 20th century that once if </v>
<v Speaker 4>businesses run and they'll eventually </v>

1277
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 4>create monopolies.</v>

1278
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.873
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think happened with Google and the </v>

1279
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.673
<v Speaker 4>function of the government is to protect</v>
<v Speaker 4>us against that so that there's </v>

1280
00:58:13.211 --> 00:58:14.044
<v Speaker 4>opportunities for the little guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>small businesses to get in and to </v>

1281
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 4>compete with these bigger companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1282
00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:19.024
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can ever work on a global level now </v>

1283
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:24.740
<v Speaker 4>with sort of the way that trade operates</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with,</v>

1284
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 4>and with there being such powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>monoliths already in place.</v>

1285
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Will those powers ever yield any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their potency?</v>

1286
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 4>What would make it Google?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1287
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:37.340
<v Speaker 4>as in the silicon valley giants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1288
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.373
<v Speaker 4>the Energy John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the forces that we know we're behind </v>

1289
00:58:41.711 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 4>the sort of the recent Middle East and </v>
<v Speaker 4>oil wars.</v>

1290
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 4>What will make those companies you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of their power,</v>

1291
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:51.250
<v Speaker 4>what would do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What force could oppose that?</v>

1292
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Only the people and under what banner to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the People Unite.</v>

1293
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.473
<v Speaker 4>It's like you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels to me that you're taking away </v>

1294
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:58.783
<v Speaker 4>the hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The capacity for human beings to unite </v>

1295
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.220
<v Speaker 4>under by don't agree with divisive </v>
<v Speaker 4>policy of your,</v>

1296
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.991
<v Speaker 4>this gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1297
00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:05.824
<v Speaker 4>that color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are one and we should look </v>

1298
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 4>for ways to find common connections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got more,</v>

1299
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.593
<v Speaker 4>probably more in common with you even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though there's so much different about </v>

1300
00:59:12.771 --> 00:59:16.050
<v Speaker 4>us politically and believing in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're both mouthy individually.</v>

1301
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.233
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I agree with that and I think that </v>

1302
00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:20.760
<v Speaker 4>that's important discussion to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I,</v>

1303
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.490
<v Speaker 4>in terms of how I use my voice</v>

1304
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:23.443
<v Speaker 3>and what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the realm of politics and I </v>

1305
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.320
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the problem is,</v>

1306
00:59:26.321 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 3>is that people want to insert compassion</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the political realm too much.</v>

1307
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:32.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just management will,</v>

1308
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:37.190
<v Speaker 3>is politics is not about helping human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings to gain access to resources.</v>

1309
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that the what,</v>

1310
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 3>what should be the function of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician?</v>

1311
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.510
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that you told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the bloody expert.</v>

1312
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're supposed to go and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>should it be?</v>

1313
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.161
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1314
00:59:49.161 --> 00:59:49.994
<v Speaker 3>I think it's gotten to the point now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it just becomes about them trying </v>

1315
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:54.160
<v Speaker 3>to enrich their own pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should it be.</v>

1316
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.093
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are there to protect the rights of </v>

1317
00:59:57.351 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 3>the people that have already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>

1318
00:59:58.911 --> 00:59:59.744
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are supposed to be </v>

1319
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.184
<v Speaker 3>representing their constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that were all bloody bloody </v>

1320
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>

1321
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.033
<v Speaker 3>What about people that need help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Making sure that their rights are </v>

1322
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.490
<v Speaker 3>protected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're able to create an ad,</v>

1323
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 3>that they have opportunities and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that you can,</v>

1324
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.070
<v Speaker 3>that they'll still have opportunities if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grow government is.</v>

1325
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.913
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been so many times nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's killed 100 million people in the </v>

1326
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.190
<v Speaker 3>last 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1327
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.033
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's jarring to me that we have people </v>

1328
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 3>that are running around saying that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>good again,</v>

1329
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 3>especially in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1330
01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 3>you guys really should understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>social doesn't work.</v>

1331
01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean like really like what is it going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take for your.</v>

1332

<v Speaker 3>phone call and America,</v>

1339
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:49.184
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Corbyn's like a democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialist who says a lot of antisemitic </v>

<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

<v Speaker 3>breasts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's why we're doing tpu kegs.</v>

1350
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:08.943

<v Speaker 3>normal conservative principles again </v>

1351

<v Speaker 3>into the dialogue because we've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone crazy.</v>

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 3>The globalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1373
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:10.904
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1374
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:11.833
<v Speaker 3>and all of the people that stood up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said awful things about trump are now </v>

1375
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:17.140
<v Speaker 3>realizing that everything that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying was essentially right,</v>

1376
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his people think about what's going </v>

1377
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 3>on in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fascinating.</v>

1378
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>The far left and the far right are </v>
<v Speaker 3>together rioting in the streets.</v>

1379
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about that and why?</v>

1380
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Because of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what was the tipping point?</v>

1381
01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 3>They were hiking prices to protect the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1382
01:02:32.221 --> 01:02:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1383
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:33.763
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to tell you that they're </v>

1384
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 3>doing something to protect you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but extracting,</v>

1385
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:36.683
<v Speaker 3>finding fun ways to extract dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there is no jobs and people are </v>

1386
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:39.804
<v Speaker 3>unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every ones on welfare and government </v>

1387
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:41.814
<v Speaker 3>programs and on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you asked what happens in socialism </v>

1388
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.140
<v Speaker 3>every single time she met kronas </v>
<v Speaker 3>associates,</v>

1389
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:50.080
<v Speaker 3>which is just bizarre to me because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a former social.</v>

1390
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.760
<v Speaker 3>France has been proliferating a welfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>state since the 19 seventies.</v>

1391
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it is.</v>

1392
01:02:54.931 --> 01:02:56.880
<v Speaker 3>There are people don't work in French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're lazy.</v>

1393
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens in a socialist </v>
<v Speaker 3>model.</v>

1394
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Everyone becomes lazy because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to say,</v>

1395
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.580
<v Speaker 3>if you become Richmond attacks you with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the hell am I going to work all,</v>

1396
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 3>sit back and wait for the government to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give us handouts.</v>

1397
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't happen because now there's no</v>

1398
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 3>one left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tax.</v>

1399
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's equally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are right.</v>

1400
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:16.770
<v Speaker 3>Socialism does call poverty crime base </v>
<v Speaker 3>for socialism.</v>

1401
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:18.090
<v Speaker 3>If you want equality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>

1402
01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:18.820
<v Speaker 3>They reasonable</v>

1403
01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.641
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1404
01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:20.474
<v Speaker 2>I've been a bit Glib and a bit silly at </v>
<v Speaker 2>several points during this conversation </v>

1405
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>because I find you very charming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to talk to,</v>

1406
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:29.143
<v Speaker 2>but I must say in all seriousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot cite any of these countries </v>

1407
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:38.660
<v Speaker 2>as examples of socialism or socialism's </v>
<v Speaker 2>of failures because they.</v>

1408
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.093
<v Speaker 2>Because macron is existing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortably within the framework of the </v>

1409
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:45.283
<v Speaker 2>kind of neo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo liberal failings that are bringing </v>

1410
01:03:48.981 --> 01:03:49.814
<v Speaker 2>about the current mass discontentment </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has brought about brexit and trump </v>

1411
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.113
<v Speaker 2>and I think that neither brexit nor </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump will address or eight ordinary </v>

1412
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.730
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Jot.</v>

1413
01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:02.623
<v Speaker 2>Not that I disagree with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>voting for Brexit or for voting for </v>

1414
01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:05.654
<v Speaker 2>trump because I agree with them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>things weren't going well for ordinary </v>

1415
01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:11.060
<v Speaker 2>people and I understand their </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction,</v>

1416
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.163
<v Speaker 2>but what I don't see how the solution to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems of ordinary people will </v>

1417
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.120
<v Speaker 2>ever be to give more power to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>already powerful.</v>

1418
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't confront you hugely over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1419
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.720
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I both do not trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1420
01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:27.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm beginning to work out where people </v>

1421
01:04:28.851 --> 01:04:31.620
<v Speaker 2>from the left and where they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1422
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.830
<v Speaker 2>collaborate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collude and agree.</v>

1423
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:34.813
<v Speaker 2>But obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main problem for me is that I feel </v>

1424
01:04:37.101 --> 01:04:41.630
<v Speaker 2>that all politics ultimately has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>an expression of human goodness.</v>

1425
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.870
<v Speaker 2>And whilst it is ultimately about </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatism,</v>

1426
01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 2>what is the point in being pragmatic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're not symbol timelessly,</v>

1427
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.940
<v Speaker 2>being loving and beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is our aim?</v>

1428
01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:56.540
<v Speaker 2>What is the optimum?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we trying to achieve?</v>

1429
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:57.523
<v Speaker 2>And surely that must be a fair and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>world where the brilliant get to thrive </v>

1430
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 2>and the vulnerable are loved and taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of.</v>

1431
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.653
<v Speaker 2>A shaming that there are still </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories such as the vulnerable and </v>

1432
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:11.803
<v Speaker 2>the brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love everything you said is it sounds </v>

1433
01:05:13.431 --> 01:05:14.264
<v Speaker 2>totally utopia,</v>

1434
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1435
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:17.510
<v Speaker 3>that's what people say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1436
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Not Conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can created government for me right now.</v>

1437
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.520
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1438
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:27.040
<v Speaker 4>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it right now.</v>

1439
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean seriously,</v>

1440
01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:28.804
<v Speaker 4>because this is how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how socialism gets sold because </v>

1441
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 4>it sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1442
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:38.970
<v Speaker 4>but that is a socialist socialist pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that's what they be socialist,</v>

1443
01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:40.181
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amount.</v>

1444
01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Saying the Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want a world where everybody,</v>

1445
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 4>the minimum wage is $30 an hour and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know who's going to pay for it.</v>

1446
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to talk practically.</v>

1447
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.763
<v Speaker 4>It's going to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to just tax the rich and </v>

1448
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:53.554
<v Speaker 4>we're going to take from this person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can only take from the rich for so </v>

1449
01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Essentially what you have to focus on is</v>

1450
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.890
<v Speaker 4>creating opportunities for every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>person to become rich,</v>

1451
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.703
<v Speaker 4>systemic inequality and a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical disjunct in the fact that </v>

1452
01:06:06.131 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 4>when there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when all these systems,</v>

1453
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 4>these systems that you say are going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of us,</v>

1454
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 4>they're going to create trickle down </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealth,</v>

1455
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 4>but when they did ultimately inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 4>fail,</v>

1456
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they do fail,</v>

1457
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.800
<v Speaker 4>they are bailed out by the people.</v>

1458
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary people,</v>

1459
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.800
<v Speaker 4>so why should I trust those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't,</v>

1460
01:06:26.801 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 4>but why don't you keep telling us that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we should grow government.</v>

1461
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you to centralization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that we need programs to help</v>

1462
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:40.230
<v Speaker 4>people know what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The words are coming.</v>

1463
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.690
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're building your community.</v>

1464
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.510
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's your position.</v>

1465
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 4>That's a conservative position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're saying all of these programs,</v>

1466
01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:51.200
<v Speaker 4>entities might need some assistance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1467
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 4>I think you just don't realize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a conservative.</v>

1468
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are a conservative because you were.</v>

1469
01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.780
<v Speaker 4>You're identifying the same problems and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're agreeing the solution not be more</v>

1470
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 4>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've backed socialist candidates,</v>

1471
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:11.170
<v Speaker 4>which makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything lines up biggest trouble.</v>

1472
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I go and we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1473
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.920
<v Speaker 4>don't vote for anyone because I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all total bullshit and it ends with</v>

1474
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:17.050
<v Speaker 4>the power ends up in the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same people anyway,</v>

1475
01:07:17.051 --> 01:07:21.690
<v Speaker 4>and it was as if I kicked the football,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really prime minister,</v>

1476
01:07:21.691 --> 01:07:22.524
<v Speaker 4>the Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Guardian as a matter of fact shot </v>

1477
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.400
<v Speaker 4>and were probably the worst job that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of changed their propaganda.</v>

1478
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:32.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just literally propaganda by </v>

1479
01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 4>finger that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why I would say that the differences</v>

1480
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 4>between some of these things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing about,</v>

1481
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:39.454
<v Speaker 4>the distinctions are negligible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that what's required is a kind </v>

1482
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 4>of radicalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radical change,</v>

1483
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.440
<v Speaker 4>but what makes me nervous about some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the stuff you say candice,</v>

1484
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.153
<v Speaker 4>is it's kind of lack of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't help but see that teenage girl </v>

1485
01:07:55.631 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 4>with Anorexia not being treated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>love and care and nurture.</v>

1486
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:04.080
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you get what I'm saying.</v>

1487
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.940
<v Speaker 4>Does that make it more likely that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people feel loving and compassionate?</v>

1488
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the role of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1489
01:08:12.031 --> 01:08:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the role of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if we were.</v>

1490
01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 4>This is not about politics and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>started</v>

1491
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 3>talking about posting done raising kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was so compassionate.</v>

1492
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Industrial post technological capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>

1493
01:08:23.371 --> 01:08:26.610
<v Speaker 4>The family is no longer an all powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>unit.</v>

1494
01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.350
<v Speaker 4>There is already such massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>

1495
01:08:28.351 --> 01:08:29.184
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not clever enough to argue with you </v>

1496
01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:32.334
<v Speaker 4>about whether or not big government </v>
<v Speaker 4>centralization is problematic as you </v>

1497
01:08:36.211 --> 01:08:37.044
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I do know is unimpeded </v>

1498
01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:39.683
<v Speaker 4>capitalist power is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>contribution to the problems we have in </v>

1499
01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:44.220
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1500
01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.950
<v Speaker 4>Actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so socialism has has killed.</v>

1501
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:51.060
<v Speaker 4>It's not capitalism killed 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

1502
01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:54.450
<v Speaker 4>It was harder to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harder to curate the information.</v>

1503
01:08:54.451 --> 01:08:55.284
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how many people are killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the various colonial wars that </v>

1504
01:08:57.271 --> 01:08:59.970
<v Speaker 4>America has been engaged with ever since</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War.</v>

1505
01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:00.993
<v Speaker 4>All of those economic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close ideological component of that is </v>

1506
01:09:03.991 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1507
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.350
<v Speaker 4>and I will agree with you here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you're going to go and you</v>

1508
01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:09.450
<v Speaker 4>don't have natural resources because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know,</v>

1509
01:09:09.451 --> 01:09:10.284
<v Speaker 4>environment environmentally friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids don't want you to do fracking or </v>

1510
01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.490
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you go and you say,</v>

1511
01:09:14.491 --> 01:09:15.324
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an oil rich country and we're </v>

1512
01:09:15.721 --> 01:09:16.710
<v Speaker 4>going to go and we're going to invade </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1513
01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:18.600
<v Speaker 4>We're going to take things over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>

1514
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.463
<v Speaker 4>I disagree with all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it'd be an Itam has got to be the </v>

1515
01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 4>aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be seriously saying that Islam</v>

1516
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:25.740
<v Speaker 4>should be the aim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you just shouldn't be.</v>

1517
01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:29.610
<v Speaker 4>That shouldn't be the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally like like that.</v>

1518
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.643
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will also be the place where we all </v>

1519
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 3>can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't happen.</v>

1520
01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Human beings are always going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've since the,</v>

1521
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.780
<v Speaker 3>since biblical times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are always going to battle.</v>

1522
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.620
<v Speaker 3>The point of the Bible is that we will </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend that.</v>

1523
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:48.180
<v Speaker 3>A man will transcend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

1524
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.240
<v Speaker 3>We can get beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primal desires,</v>

1525
01:09:50.241 --> 01:09:53.210
<v Speaker 3>our primal desires that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn into systems,</v>

1526
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.160
<v Speaker 3>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jealousy,</v>

1527
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.580
<v Speaker 3>conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1528
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1529
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.733
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying you have to acknowledge that </v>

1530
01:09:58.971 --> 01:09:59.804
<v Speaker 3>this exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why it's foolish when people </v>

1531
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 3>gave up all of your and then what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens?</v>

1532
01:10:04.671 --> 01:10:05.504
<v Speaker 3>What happened to Venezuela when they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>up all the rights and they sold them </v>

1533
01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:07.934
<v Speaker 3>this utopian concept that Russell brand </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves and there's going to be flowers </v>

1534
01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:11.954
<v Speaker 3>and Venezuela and skittles and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go to Willy Wonka everyday </v>

1535
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.690
<v Speaker 3>because what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1536
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:19.230
<v Speaker 3>we found out what happens when you give </v>
<v Speaker 3>all your money,</v>

1537
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.103
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government keeps it found in </v>

1538
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.150
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

1539
01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know why?</v>

1540
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Because the government is governed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings and human beings are greedy</v>

1541
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.770
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a terrible human being,</v>

1542
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:32.540
<v Speaker 3>but when you give them all of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1543
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.790
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1544
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candice,</v>

1545
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.910
<v Speaker 3>these untrammeled individuals that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten no regulation,</v>

1546
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.773
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be different from the </v>

1547
01:10:42.381 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Venezuelan government aid government </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they,</v>

1548
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:45.104
<v Speaker 3>when their incentives are not to go line</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own pockets and government and </v>

1549
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:47.803
<v Speaker 3>know that they have term limits and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they literally are there to serve the </v>

1550
01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:50.560
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1551
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.450
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then allow them to do their damn job and</v>

1552
01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>look at these companies and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this now but not Napoli?</v>

1553
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1554
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Break up Google will that we agree on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as well.</v>

1555
01:10:59.591 --> 01:11:00.424
<v Speaker 4>As long as it still works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I do need it mostly for my own </v>

1556
01:11:02.651 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1557
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:07.143
<v Speaker 4>I just need a search engine called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russell brand search engine that be </v>

1558
01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:13.090
<v Speaker 4>enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as I have that,</v>

1559
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 4>you can break up that monopoly.</v>

1560
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.563
<v Speaker 2>Candice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing I'm going to ask </v>

1561
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing you just said mate,</v>

1562
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>about like a human beings are greedy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruel and components of humanity.</v>

1563
01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Here were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that that's huge for me.</v>

1564
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 2>When you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very telling.</v>

1565
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I feel that that is ultimately what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1566
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I think human beings are vocally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that first time,</v>

1567
01:11:33.821 --> 01:11:36.280
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off human beings do you.</v>

1568
01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.193
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think were more good or more </v>

1569
01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:39.810
<v Speaker 2>evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1570
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I think human beings are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think were born?</v>

1571
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.613
<v Speaker 2>Pure and good and wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a small child as soaps and </v>

1572
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>teach human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1573
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture is definitely a factor,</v>

1574
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:54.090
<v Speaker 2>but this is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've asked me a question.</v>

1575
01:11:54.091 --> 01:11:54.924
<v Speaker 2>Please allow me to out sultanates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says the line between good and evil </v>

1576
01:11:58.261 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 2>runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not through nations,</v>

1577
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 2>religions or creeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but through every human heart,</v>

1578
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:05.310
<v Speaker 2>because I know that there is darkness in</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1579
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I know there is selfishness and greed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and like Libido,</v>

1580
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 2>life force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

1581
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:12.060
<v Speaker 2>but last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1582
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.823
<v Speaker 2>I know all these things exist in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I need to exist within communities </v>

1583
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:21.030
<v Speaker 2>and systems that acknowledge that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed and that I can fail,</v>

1584
01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 2>but encourage the better parts of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1585
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not a kind of Venal,</v>

1586
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.540
<v Speaker 2>economically driven system that rewards </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the pursuit of excess.</v>

1587
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:35.363
<v Speaker 2>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can ever be fulfilled </v>

1588
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:37.734
<v Speaker 2>by commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can ever be fulfilled </v>

1589
01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:40.584
<v Speaker 2>through acquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that our goals must become </v>

1590
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:45.090
<v Speaker 2>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I agree with that.</v>

1591
01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in favor of creating banal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stalinist,</v>

1592
01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:50.883
<v Speaker 2>a massacre factories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also resent and reject the </v>

1593
01:12:55.891 --> 01:13:00.891
<v Speaker 2>illusion of a commercial capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>state where people are being underserved</v>

1594
01:13:01.501 --> 01:13:02.334
<v Speaker 2>spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are neglected and cut off and </v>

1595
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 2>below.</v>

1596
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drew Loki.</v>

1597
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.083
<v Speaker 2>We're with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've ever been statistically things </v>

1598
01:13:07.931 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 2>that Upi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1599
01:13:09.361 --> 01:13:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I live in this world and I feel a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction,</v>

1600
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been rich,</v>

1601
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:15.414
<v Speaker 2>I've been poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in both of those worlds and I </v>

1602
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>sense that there is something spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not being served,</v>

1603
01:13:21.791 --> 01:13:22.624
<v Speaker 2>that is being neglected and I feel a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge part of that is living in a world </v>

1604
01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.730
<v Speaker 2>where the supreme ideals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically driven,</v>

1605
01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:30.564
<v Speaker 2>where there is a huge unfairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we are ignoring the problems of </v>

1606
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:34.494
<v Speaker 2>the earth and to hear you talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of fracking and like in it simply </v>

1607
01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:44.241
<v Speaker 2>because it is another way of serving </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative or capitalist goals.</v>

1608
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.653
<v Speaker 2>That concerns me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not I brought it up because you </v>

1609
01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:48.054
<v Speaker 2>brought up the Middle East and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquest that we're going over there </v>

1610
01:13:50.101 --> 01:13:53.850
<v Speaker 2>because he wanted their conservatism </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be about conserve the planet.</v>

1611
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.830
<v Speaker 2>First and foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to live on it.</v>

1612
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that in America it </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned me.</v>

1613
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.470
<v Speaker 2>It means used to be supply about </v>
<v Speaker 2>conserving.</v>

1614
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:02.304
<v Speaker 2>We've got to look after the care a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more about the environment here </v>

1615
01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:05.904
<v Speaker 2>than in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the like obviously the </v>

1616
01:14:07.321 --> 01:14:08.154
<v Speaker 2>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think probably stronger here I've </v>

1617
01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:10.194
<v Speaker 2>noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's one way one is </v>

1618
01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>wrong or one is</v>

1619
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just making a note here.</v>

1620
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.253
<v Speaker 3>How could we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're talking about is that you </v>

1621
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 3>think that all that exists is politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take Yoga class.</v>

1622
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.583
<v Speaker 3>You want some spiritual balance after </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to work or you go take a yoga </v>

1623
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the money to do that.</v>

1624
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:26.491
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go.</v>

1625
01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you sit and do Koombaya and do all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

1626
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I like it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Family.</v>

1627
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really,</v>

1628
01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:36.190
<v Speaker 3>I like getting from Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Love Yoga.</v>

1629
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:37.024
<v Speaker 3>I love spiritualism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you I originally found you </v>

1630
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.490
<v Speaker 3>because you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritualism.</v>

1631
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.333
<v Speaker 3>I was like on Youtube and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>just being very granted would show was </v>

1632
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:45.634
<v Speaker 3>never seen that show before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you were talking about spiritual </v>

1633
01:14:47.231 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment and I agree with you on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those things.</v>

1634
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:50.583
<v Speaker 3>Where we disagree is that you don't seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think that both of those can live at </v>

1635
01:14:53.261 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

1636
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Like if capitalism exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritualism,</v>

1637
01:14:56.021 --> 01:14:56.830
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1638
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:57.663
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1639
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 3>You can be spiritual and you can let </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism you like it.</v>

1640
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:02.060
<v Speaker 3>A capitalist says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>

1641
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I like switches from so much I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to open a yoga studio.</v>

1642
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:06.363
<v Speaker 3>Know that is turning everything into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>commodity like ultimate end of </v>

1643
01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 3>everything is to turn and I'm guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1644
01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I like genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the kind of person.</v>

1645
01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I make up a beautiful song from my door </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Oh my God,</v>

1646
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I should write a children's book about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1647
01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I have that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am an entrepreneurial person.</v>

1648
01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:23.614
<v Speaker 3>I am an individualist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel that these impulses in me </v>

1649
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 3>kind of be better utilized if they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the service of others,</v>

1650
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 3>so then share it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

1651
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I get spiritual fulfillment when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1652
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:37.660
<v Speaker 3>when black kids from the ghettos and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood,</v>

1653
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1654
01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 3>To me and say thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finding your perspective has transformed</v>

1655
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:42.940
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1656
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.863
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I just put out something that I </v>

1657
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:47.980
<v Speaker 3>genuinely believe in and it's backed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart and it's back to my spirit.</v>

1658
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Now what fulfills you might be something</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

1659
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.213
<v Speaker 3>but you determining that what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>should like and what should dry you </v>

1660
01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:54.580
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what fulfills that are,</v>

1661
01:15:54.581 --> 01:15:56.310
<v Speaker 3>what should be compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

1662
01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Those are words that are subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not objective.</v>

1663
01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.443
<v Speaker 3>It's subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true and I think I can </v>

1664
01:16:02.741 --> 01:16:03.574
<v Speaker 3>understand why a young black children </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be inspired by a powerful woman </v>

1665
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:14.140
<v Speaker 3>like you who communicates brilliantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and is so strong and successful,</v>

1666
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.033
<v Speaker 3>but I would imagine it may be </v>
<v Speaker 3>disheartening to hear you disavow the </v>

1667
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:20.853
<v Speaker 3>impact of social historical and cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>influences on the plight of individuals </v>

1668
01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:30.420
<v Speaker 3>and individual families to extract that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's cool,</v>

1669
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.500
<v Speaker 3>but I don't talk about it all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1670
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 3>You're condemning people in saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual is in charge of their own</v>

1671
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:38.050
<v Speaker 3>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

1672
01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 3>You are in the shadow of that is people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are responsibility of to blame.</v>

1673
01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1674
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.033
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I truly believe if people wake up and </v>

1675
01:16:46.661 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 3>they understand that they even control </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own destiny,</v>

1676
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.600
<v Speaker 3>that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be in control of.</v>

1677
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>That is a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good point,</v>

1678
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:57.871
<v Speaker 3>but I do also agree that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation of all of us to be careful,</v>

1679
01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:01.230
<v Speaker 3>protect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reach out to one another and I feel like</v>

1680
01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned that you feel that because</v>

1681
01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is the love?</v>

1682
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's love.</v>

1683
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:12.194
<v Speaker 3>In my personal life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel bad for people that are </v>

1684
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 3>lazy and looking for excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that sounds,</v>

1685
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.850
<v Speaker 3>if that feels like.</v>

1686
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

1687
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 3>let's get to the course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figure most people are lazy.</v>

1688
01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much.</v>

1689
01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1690
01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.240
<v Speaker 3>there you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>

1691
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.433
<v Speaker 3>Get success and then you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get to a certain age and you </v>

1692
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 3>realize you have accomplished nothing or</v>
<v Speaker 3>drove and all of a sudden you became.</v>

1693
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people are lazy.</v>

1694
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:37.334
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be in bed sleeping sometimes </v>

1695
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:43.430
<v Speaker 3>when I get up and I do stop because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized I have to be different,</v>

1696
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:44.264
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You asked telling me what I have to </v>

1697
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.513
<v Speaker 3>extra eyes compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understanding how people are lazy </v>

1698
01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 3>because they woke up one day and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>27,</v>

1699
01:17:49.851 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 3>they realize you have accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

1700
01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:53.120
<v Speaker 3>so they turned to videos that tell them </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not their fault,</v>

1701
01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:54.340
<v Speaker 3>it's somebody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the white man.</v>

1702
01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:55.730
<v Speaker 3>It's the rich man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the tall man.</v>

1703
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.110
<v Speaker 3>It's the short man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1704
01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:58.063
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am telling you that personal </v>

1705
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:02.030
<v Speaker 3>responsibility is really the key to </v>
<v Speaker 3>unlocking light.</v>

1706
01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.113
<v Speaker 3>CanNot deny things that happened and did</v>
<v Speaker 3>you exercise compassion in those </v>

1707
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 3>moments?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I give to charity,</v>

1708
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.423
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be enough because by </v>

1709
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 3>taking the lazy people in my home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already got a cat.</v>

1710
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.760
<v Speaker 3>She's pretty fucking lazy because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying is this.</v>

1711
01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:28.250
<v Speaker 3>What am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying to me?</v>

1712
01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So I'm saying to you that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>misusing your power,</v>

1713
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:36.710
<v Speaker 3>that you should be using your power to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring other people up.</v>

1714
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel that to deny that there,</v>

1715
01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.073
<v Speaker 3>that there is economic disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The racial inequality is part of the </v>

1716
01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:46.664
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but historically there has been a </v>

1717
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:51.830
<v Speaker 3>component of the male oppression of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>

1718
01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1719
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree that the world puts.</v>

1720
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:58.640
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about our stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>individually agree with.</v>

1721
01:18:58.641 --> 01:19:00.500
<v Speaker 3>We're agreeing everything that you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't deny.</v>

1722
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.573
<v Speaker 3>I acknowledged that there's economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>disparity because I tell them everyday </v>

1723
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:06.500
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why is why I teach them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's economic disparity.</v>

1724
01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Don't be so foolish to believe it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your skin is black.</v>

1725
01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 3>It's because we are disproportionately </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking handouts from the government.</v>

1726
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 3>We are disproportionately marriage the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

1727
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 3>and we have bought into our own victim </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality.</v>

1728
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're taking advice from fucking</v>

1729
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:18.704
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James about politics and voting </v>
<v Speaker 3>in people that want to do harm to the </v>

1730
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:23.090
<v Speaker 3>black community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plan.</v>

1731
01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:23.924
<v Speaker 3>Simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't even know their own </v>

1732
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:25.724
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sit down and and you have black </v>

1733
01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:27.704
<v Speaker 3>people that are advocating for planned </v>
<v Speaker 3>parenthood and nobody's talking about </v>

1734
01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:30.584
<v Speaker 3>the quiet black genocide that's taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place in America right now because our </v>

1735
01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.990
<v Speaker 3>birth rate has completely stagnated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the only ones.</v>

1736
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Sixty one percent of all new brush </v>
<v Speaker 3>Latino.</v>

1737
01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.140
<v Speaker 3>So in the Democrats say open borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open borders.</v>

1738
01:19:40.141 --> 01:19:41.630
<v Speaker 3>What they're really saying is boats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boats,</v>

1739
01:19:41.631 --> 01:19:42.464
<v Speaker 3>because the black people are not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be able to stay in our party much </v>

1740
01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:45.470
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let them know that planned parenthood</v>

1741
01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:46.304
<v Speaker 3>was created by an avowed racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Margaret Sanger who said that her </v>

1742
01:19:48.801 --> 01:19:51.020
<v Speaker 3>purpose was to exterminate the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>

1743
01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people should be exterminated like</v>

1744
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 3>weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most bucket don't know that,</v>

1745
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.273
<v Speaker 3>and yet they go out and they say </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are crazy because they </v>

1746
01:19:57.201 --> 01:19:59.990
<v Speaker 3>want to defund planned parenthood </v>
<v Speaker 3>defunded because the black,</v>

1747
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.340
<v Speaker 3>the black birth rate has has stagnated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1748
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.300
<v Speaker 3>so I'm actually all about black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

1749
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>which is why when people actually find </v>
<v Speaker 3>me long former listened to</v>

1750
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 4>what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it clicks and they say,</v>

1751
01:20:10.231 --> 01:20:12.390
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they researched Margaret sanger</v>

1752
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 4>and then they researched that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black birth rate,</v>

1753
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:15.623
<v Speaker 4>and they realize that we have literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>we are paying politicians taking the to </v>

1754
01:20:18.751 --> 01:20:19.584
<v Speaker 4>tear apart our families and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that we don't have a place in </v>

1755
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:23.670
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look,</v>

1756
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.520
<v Speaker 4>I agree with some of the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are saying,</v>

1757
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.383
<v Speaker 4>but what I don't understand is how this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information can neatly absolves or </v>

1758
01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:35.700
<v Speaker 4>resolve itself at the point of a much </v>
<v Speaker 4>wider.</v>

1759
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.910
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump's a good thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1760
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 4>So easily illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so easy.</v>

1761
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.333
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I got into this because </v>

1762
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.570
<v Speaker 4>because Donald Trump was a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump has done more for the black</v>

1763
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:46.404
<v Speaker 4>community then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then certainly any of the predecessor </v>

1764
01:20:48.121 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 4>Democrat presidents had done beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1765
01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.040
<v Speaker 4>you have Bill Clinton who was held as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>black presidential hero,</v>

1766
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:55.350
<v Speaker 4>but first black president is what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>called Bill Clinton.</v>

1767
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.333
<v Speaker 4>He also locked up more black men than </v>
<v Speaker 4>any president in the history of the </v>

1768
01:20:59.010 --> 01:20:59.843
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>

1769
01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:01.410
<v Speaker 4>He put in place with three strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laws.</v>

1770
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.680
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1771
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:05.420
<v Speaker 4>and then you have lbj hailed as a hero </v>
<v Speaker 4>in our textbooks.</v>

1772
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:06.263
<v Speaker 4>He's the one that implemented the </v>
<v Speaker 4>welfare state and he called her the </v>

1773
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:08.670
<v Speaker 4>nigger bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1774
01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:10.050
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally called,</v>

1775
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the civil rights act,</v>

1776
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.173
<v Speaker 4>the nigger belt bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't know that now it's all </v>

1777
01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:14.510
<v Speaker 4>available on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>

1778
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.353
<v Speaker 4>all they have to do is hear what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll do that after they watch </v>

1779
01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:18.480
<v Speaker 4>this podcast and do research and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

1780
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.030
<v Speaker 4>why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is the education system lying to me?</v>

1781
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Why do I think Bill Clinton's a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>person?</v>

1782
01:21:22.771 --> 01:21:25.950
<v Speaker 4>After what he did to Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't disagree with you,</v>

1783
01:21:25.951 --> 01:21:26.784
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I think more broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see how you meet a lot of your </v>

1784
01:21:29.641 --> 01:21:34.590
<v Speaker 4>goals by condemning apparently left </v>
<v Speaker 4>centrist politicians who I remember I've</v>

1785
01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:35.424
<v Speaker 4>already told you I don't see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between left and right </v>

1786
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:40.040
<v Speaker 4>within the limited framework of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional political.</v>

1787
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.710
<v Speaker 4>That's fair as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1788
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as meaningful.</v>

1789
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go and have some stuff to eat.</v>

1790
01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:49.150
<v Speaker 4>The perhaps perhaps perhaps the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>is actually that you're hungry.</v>

1791
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:50.803
<v Speaker 4>Was Secretary happened because a hungry </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who's taking it out on most </v>

1792
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.903
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable members of society and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>black community and the black community </v>

1793
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.903
<v Speaker 4>for synchronous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you sound like every leftist </v>

1794
01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 4>politician script.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm empowering for black people.</v>

1795
01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.890
<v Speaker 4>All they have to do is listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

1796
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 2>goal of your empowerment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ends in a sort of a rather unpleasant</v>

1797
01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:22.344
<v Speaker 2>individualistic message that leaves </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that doesn't include the </v>

1798
01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:26.994
<v Speaker 2>possibility that some people's social </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and personal history has left </v>

1799
01:22:30.151 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 2>them impaired and unable to compete in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>system but prizes,</v>

1800
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:35.603
<v Speaker 2>certain assets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain personal attributes above </v>

1801
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us like that.</v>

1802
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:40.044
<v Speaker 2>We need a culture that can accommodate </v>
<v Speaker 2>all people because all people exist and </v>

1803
01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>all people do have rights and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1804
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:49.710
<v Speaker 2>whilst I feel like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see the logic in,</v>

1805
01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what you're saying about I'm like,</v>

1806
01:22:51.501 --> 01:22:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy stuff and all that.</v>

1807
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.353
<v Speaker 2>All you need to do is all we need to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is quickly look at who has the most </v>

1808
01:22:57.091 --> 01:22:58.860
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has the most power,</v>

1809
01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:01.320
<v Speaker 2>who has the most influence that day </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas available.</v>

1810
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:02.453
<v Speaker 2>Like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you say if like s like 15 </v>

1811
01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>people have</v>

1812
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 4>as much wealth as the poorest 5 billion </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1813
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 4>That's not minor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a serious systemic problem.</v>

1814
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.160
<v Speaker 4>We could solve a great many problems by </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply removing and redistribute in that</v>

1815
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 4>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even that's not enough.</v>

1816
01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:20.893
<v Speaker 4>I'm undergrad changing systems more </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadly where we do agree hugely as on </v>

1817
01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 4>decentralization and the breakup of </v>
<v Speaker 4>monopolies.</v>

1818
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:28.743
<v Speaker 4>But what I think is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction you and I have is your </v>

1819
01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:34.510
<v Speaker 4>belief that people are governed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>selfish,</v>

1820
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.153
<v Speaker 4>selfish impulses and my belief that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are ultimately good and that we </v>

1821
01:23:39.941 --> 01:23:40.774
<v Speaker 4>should create systems and communities </v>
<v Speaker 4>and values that encourage our virtue </v>

1822
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:50.700
<v Speaker 4>rather than usher us subtly towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>either nihilism or selfishness,</v>

1823
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:55.580
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's what you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing better than that.</v>

1824
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm preventing people from falling into </v>
<v Speaker 4>your logic because the easiest people to</v>

1825
01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:01.210
<v Speaker 4>take advantage of people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you believe,</v>

1826
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 4>because then all they do is to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like George Soros or Jeff Bezos</v>

1827
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:04.984
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why they want socialism because </v>

1828
01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 4>it says all of you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to stay poor,</v>

1829
01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:10.000
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to sell to you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fix all your problems.</v>

1830
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.170
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get all of your rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>to us,</v>

1831
01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.030
<v Speaker 4>and that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens every single time.</v>

1832
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:13.893
<v Speaker 4>Realized that within a system that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>limited resources available to become </v>

1833
01:24:19.451 --> 01:24:22.060
<v Speaker 4>rich anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think there's finite resources.</v>

1834
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>On a finite planet?</v>

1835
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:24.571
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1836
01:24:24.571 --> 01:24:26.170
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like at once starting,</v>

1837
01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:28.900
<v Speaker 4>people are and nobody else can get rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's wrong.</v>

1838
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.880
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you not believe you don't believe</v>

1839
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:34.714
<v Speaker 4>that there's a stagnation in stacy's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>where wealth is accumulated and where </v>

1840
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:39.240
<v Speaker 4>wealth is held.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you not see that there are a dentist?</v>

1841
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 4>If you're buying into the myth that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because somebody got rich,</v>

1842
01:24:42.371 --> 01:24:45.920
<v Speaker 4>somebody else got poor and that's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>because somebody got rich multiples,</v>

1843
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.203
<v Speaker 4>perhaps our job because somebody got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which does not mean that a bunch of </v>

1844
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.080
<v Speaker 4>other people got poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fallacy and it is.</v>

1845
01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just pulled back when Jack Dorsey</v>

1846
01:24:59.171 --> 01:25:00.004
<v Speaker 4>of twitter got rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of his employees got poor and note </v>

1847
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 4>they became employees of twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook employees.</v>

1848
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm a ton of people all around the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're facebook now.</v>

1849
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Are they always register?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark Zuckerberg?</v>

1850
01:25:09.701 --> 01:25:11.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were given opportunities to get</v>

1851
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:14.190
<v Speaker 4>their foot in the door at a tech company</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it put facebook on their resume pro.</v>

1852
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.450
<v Speaker 4>The old capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I notice candice is.</v>

1853
01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I listened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Secret.</v>

1854
01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1855
01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 4>So listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the,</v>

1856
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:20.711
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1857
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:23.530
<v Speaker 4>the world is limited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only that big.</v>

1858
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:24.543
<v Speaker 4>There are people on the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only a tiny number of people have got </v>

1859
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 4>most of the wealth and asset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1860
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.190
<v Speaker 4>if some of it will trickle down to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>others,</v>

1861
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 4>that's that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that I did not work out,</v>

1862
01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:40.480
<v Speaker 4>your people are keeping that wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not letting it trickle down,</v>

1863
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.690
<v Speaker 4>sticking people in prison because there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are these brilliantly economic.</v>

1864
01:25:43.691 --> 01:25:46.210
<v Speaker 4>How do you extract well from wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

1865
01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that?</v>

1866
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.910
<v Speaker 4>That's your problem.</v>

1867
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.790
<v Speaker 4>That's theft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No competition,</v>

1868
01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:52.624
<v Speaker 4>free markets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>building a product that's better than </v>

1869
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:57.280
<v Speaker 4>facebook to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would lead to.</v>

1870
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:58.123
<v Speaker 4>So what led to this mobilism in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that I am staunchly against </v>

1871
01:26:01.961 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 4>and I speak out about all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't agree with globalism.</v>

1872
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Globalism is a bunch of elitist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fighting themselves and saying,</v>

1873
01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:07.424
<v Speaker 4>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much power we control now that can </v>

1874
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:12.330
<v Speaker 4>make sure that we're the only ones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain more regulation.</v>

1875
01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 4>That's more government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1876
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:14.204
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the function of government to make </v>

1877
01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:17.600
<v Speaker 4>sure that that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Limited government.</v>

1878
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:21.140
<v Speaker 4>That is literally why we started putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>in place these policies in America.</v>

1879
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.230
<v Speaker 4>If the government hasn't happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to finish,</v>

1880
01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:24.093
<v Speaker 4>being able to run without a government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both literally eating food now all over </v>

1881
01:26:27.561 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 4>the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the government,</v>

1882
01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.133
<v Speaker 4>so that we currently have on able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>curb or in any way control corporate </v>

1883
01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:36.224
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is less government going to do that </v>

1884
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:40.940
<v Speaker 4>more effectively or less government </v>
<v Speaker 4>busters to fight you.</v>

1885
01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.773
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm saying limited government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the idea that growing welfare </v>

1886
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:46.960
<v Speaker 4>programs and trying to extract wealth </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the rich,</v>

1887
01:26:46.961 --> 01:26:48.350
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not gonna work that's not,</v>

1888
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.333
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't work over time because that</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to talk about a finite </v>

1889
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 4>resource,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only so much money you can bleed</v>

1890
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:55.720
<v Speaker 4>out of rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1891
01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:56.873
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1892
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 4>and it never happens that way by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1893
01:26:58.221 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 4>They take money from the rich and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>enrich themselves.</v>

1894
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:00.734
<v Speaker 4>The government gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government gets Richard and people </v>

1895
01:27:01.881 --> 01:27:02.714
<v Speaker 4>get poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is what the history of the world </v>

1896
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.250
<v Speaker 4>taught us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some things to be annoying,</v>

1897
01:27:05.251 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's true,</v>

1898
01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:08.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1899
01:27:08.011 --> 01:27:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know all,</v>

1900
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.000
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union,</v>

1901
01:27:11.001 --> 01:27:13.220
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what's happening in Venezuela,</v>

1902
01:27:13.221 --> 01:27:15.040
<v Speaker 4>you know that social and doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get your,</v>

1903
01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:18.200
<v Speaker 4>your teaching or having your stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you are,</v>

1904
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:19.580
<v Speaker 4>you're just not calling it socialism.</v>

1905
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.230
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't give.</v>

1906
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.193
<v Speaker 4>What is the new system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're either going to grow government </v>

1907
01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:27.140
<v Speaker 4>or you're going to grow the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1908
01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.030
<v Speaker 4>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the only option.</v>

1909
01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:29.571
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gimme.</v>

1910
01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 4>GimMe Gimme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another option.</v>

1911
01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:37.850
<v Speaker 4>I think de-centralized collectivized </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities,</v>

1912
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 4>a confederacy of principled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooperating,</v>

1913
01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.153
<v Speaker 4>fully autonomous self governing </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities that might require to some </v>

1914
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:47.804
<v Speaker 4>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some ability to tax regulate and </v>

1915
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:53.624
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly the kind of transnational </v>

1916
01:27:58.630 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 4>monoliths that we tax to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1917
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.420
<v Speaker 4>but what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1918
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:09.640
<v Speaker 4>But hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't like get all like me because I</v>

1919
01:28:09.641 --> 01:28:10.474
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not able to immediately designed a </v>

1920
01:28:12.271 --> 01:28:14.120
<v Speaker 4>new system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not immediately.</v>

1921
01:28:14.121 --> 01:28:16.200
<v Speaker 4>You've been doing this for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I listen to,</v>

1922
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.220
<v Speaker 4>it's not the first time you've had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1923
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.530
<v Speaker 4>You're either you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to play it both ways,</v>

1924
01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 4>so you want to say I believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>

1925
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 4>but the community should tax.</v>

1926
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:24.643
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the community should be a government </v>

1927
01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:26.373
<v Speaker 4>website and let's try and see if we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>work out together because if it's not </v>

1928
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:29.864
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just simply won't you because he's a </v>

1929
01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:32.150
<v Speaker 4>bit of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to use all of it.</v>

1930
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.190
<v Speaker 4>People need to know we are building a </v>
<v Speaker 4>government thing,</v>

1931
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.881
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say it,</v>

1932
01:28:34.881 --> 01:28:36.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say we like take for example,</v>

1933
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:37.304
<v Speaker 4>now we've had brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Britain could be an independent unit if </v>

1934
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.143
<v Speaker 4>I agree that we decentralized government</v>
<v Speaker 4>power because it is meaningless and it </v>

1935
01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 4>doesn't serve ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1936
01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 4>what we need people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>

1937
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:49.874
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people it seems to want jobs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want to be meaningfully paid </v>

1938
01:28:53.771 --> 01:28:54.604
<v Speaker 4>for those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people that I think are not paid </v>

1939
01:28:55.521 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 4>enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>police,</v>

1940
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:58.820
<v Speaker 4>nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teachers,</v>

1941
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.800
<v Speaker 4>none of these people are paid enough for</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they do.</v>

1942
01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 4>That's because of the unions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's because the government.</v>

1943
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:03.263
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the LG unions and the government allow </v>

1944
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 4>us to fire fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad teachers bringing negative things in</v>

1945
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:10.100
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're white bringing negative energy.</v>

1946
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government is is the reason for that</v>

1947
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:16.320
<v Speaker 4>now differently in this new utopia that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to create.</v>

1948
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your gender,</v>

1949
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and race would be irrelevant to you?</v>

1950
01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:23.550
<v Speaker 4>You'd be free to practice whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's foolish.</v>

1951
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 4>I already don't have this government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1952
01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.613
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the government is not done </v>

1953
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 4>anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is ridiculous.</v>

1954
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.110
<v Speaker 4>What's ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you a question.</v>

1955
01:29:31.111 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 4>Actually a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of you offset those talks to you.</v>

1956
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1957
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul wrote the myth of Co a.</v>

1958
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a loaded question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe in multiculturalism?</v>

1959
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Do I believe that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures that they can just exist,</v>

1960
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.533
<v Speaker 4>coexist peacefully?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there are many cultures </v>

1961
01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 4>think that they can exist.</v>

1962
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:56.340
<v Speaker 4>I think we're two people in a room and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a problem,</v>

1963
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.233
<v Speaker 4>so of course there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict if people have got different </v>

1964
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:00.240
<v Speaker 4>belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1965
01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:01.260
<v Speaker 4>we cost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

1966
01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:02.220
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute,</v>

1967
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.680
<v Speaker 4>so you want total deregulation of bloody</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalists,</v>

1968
01:30:04.681 --> 01:30:07.470
<v Speaker 4>but when it comes to what people want </v>
<v Speaker 4>book people read when they're praying,</v>

1969
01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:08.363
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly,</v>

1970
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:14.010
<v Speaker 4>suddenly there is a regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be whatever religion you want to</v>

1971
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:15.960
<v Speaker 4>be an American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no regulation on that,</v>

1972
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:18.700
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe that that mold,</v>

1973
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.860
<v Speaker 4>multiple cultures can coexist peacefully</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's it.</v>

1974
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:23.280
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge problem.</v>

1975
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:24.223
<v Speaker 4>What do you believe in then secretary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the biggest problem </v>

1976
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:26.994
<v Speaker 4>facing Europe right now is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass migration from countries that do </v>

1977
01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 4>not support the culture of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1978
01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut up.</v>

1979
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1980
01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To talk about some positive thing.</v>

1981
01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Trying to create a utopia or over here </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this thing,</v>

1982
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.553
<v Speaker 4>in this new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new Britain that we're trying to </v>

1983
01:30:41.971 --> 01:30:44.760
<v Speaker 4>create on my ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what your gender is or</v>

1984
01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 4>how you identify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what color you are and</v>

1985
01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter what your religion is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't buy.</v>

1986
01:30:48.931 --> 01:30:51.750
<v Speaker 4>You cannot impose your will on other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1987
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.613
<v Speaker 4>You can't go around saying you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should believe this or you </v>

1988
01:30:54.061 --> 01:30:56.400
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to leave people a hell alone.</v>

1989
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

1990
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:59.323
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't yell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Component of Sharia law is that people </v>

1991
01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:03.840
<v Speaker 4>that are non believers get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

1992
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say we will help you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want Sharia law.</v>

1993
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm not bringing in Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not.</v>

1994
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.380
<v Speaker 4>We're not having met on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds terrifying,</v>

1995
01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:12.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bomb this sharia.</v>

1996
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:16.290
<v Speaker 4>Now what we're gonna do on the island </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1997
01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:18.670
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people can be fully there,</v>

1998
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:20.130
<v Speaker 4>fully autonomous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can do what they want.</v>

1999
01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:20.993
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose we are going to have to have </v>

2000
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:23.214
<v Speaker 4>communities now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might be hard for human </v>

2001
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:27.270
<v Speaker 4>beings to live in communities that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>too big.</v>

2002
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.193
<v Speaker 4>I think many of the problems that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiencing now is it's hard for us to </v>

2003
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:31.614
<v Speaker 4>hold the number of relationships we see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much variety of life is confusing </v>

2004
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:35.904
<v Speaker 4>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we need to live in smaller </v>

2005
01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:39.030
<v Speaker 4>communities and within these </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities,</v>

2006
01:31:39.031 --> 01:31:39.930
<v Speaker 4>these units,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2007
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:45.260
<v Speaker 4>let's call them Soviet people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have full a full democracy within</v>

2008
01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.234
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People vote on how they want their </v>

2009
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:50.960
<v Speaker 4>resources as happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Importantly,</v>

2010
01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:51.803
<v Speaker 4>agree Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you vote on like say each community is </v>

2011
01:31:54.451 --> 01:31:55.284
<v Speaker 4>allocated a budget and the members of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that community vote for how to spend </v>

2012
01:31:58.411 --> 01:31:59.244
<v Speaker 4>that budget.</v>

2013
01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2014
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:01.474
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So far we do need some municipal </v>

2015
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:04.630
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>IEA,</v>

2016
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 4>roads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agri police officers,</v>

2017
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:09.160
<v Speaker 4>fire malaise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fireman and nurses.</v>

2018
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:09.994
<v Speaker 4>All of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that revenue has got to come from </v>

2019
01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Private business world isn't gas attacks</v>

2020
01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm comfortable with because it's for </v>
<v Speaker 4>municipalities and that's the difference</v>

2021
01:32:17.711 --> 01:32:20.010
<v Speaker 4>between not theft and something that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to use.</v>

2022
01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 4>So I need it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do wheat right now.</v>

2023
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Are we gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Need some kind of.</v>

2024
01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Because people are going to be jealous </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

2025
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:27.190
<v Speaker 4>They're going to want to come and live </v>
<v Speaker 4>here with us.</v>

2026
01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 4>We're going to identify how are we going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to control the population we have here,</v>

2027
01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to need to know,</v>

2028
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:33.681
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2029
01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 4>We good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can just like we're not building,</v>

2030
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 4>we're an island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're surrounded by a moat already.</v>

2031
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.903
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying is that there are so </v>

2032
01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:45.784
<v Speaker 4>many unexplored possibilities and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people on both the left and right and </v>

2033
01:32:49.721 --> 01:32:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I've got those I spoke to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough of them now impede further debate</v>

2034
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:54.993
<v Speaker 4>and progressing by insisting that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>preexisting ideology is the only thing </v>

2035
01:32:59.411 --> 01:33:00.244
<v Speaker 4>that could possibly work as if history </v>
<v Speaker 4>were rich enough and long enough that </v>

2036
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:06.910
<v Speaker 4>blinking of an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the expanding of one flower,</v>

2037
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:10.210
<v Speaker 4>the issue manatee were enough to examine</v>
<v Speaker 4>all possibilities.</v>

2038
01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.253
<v Speaker 4>Now me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff you say is wooly wishy </v>

2039
01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 4>washy left the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clap trap is mere pragmatism.</v>

2040
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.733
<v Speaker 4>The experience of being human is painful</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough without us being cruel to one </v>

2041
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:22.384
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to live in communities where </v>

2042
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:25.503
<v Speaker 4>people are infested and administrative </v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly our democratic level in </v>

2043
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 4>the way that their resources are spent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way their communities are run,</v>

2044
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:34.114
<v Speaker 4>the way their schools around the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>their hospitals around full </v>

2045
01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.970
<v Speaker 4>democratization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I'm arguing for.</v>

2046
01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:42.250
<v Speaker 4>So everything that you just drew is </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2047
01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.593
<v Speaker 4>The founding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the founding principles of America is </v>

2048
01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:51.230
<v Speaker 4>what you just do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what conservatives fight for.</v>

2049
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to against it that you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative.</v>

2050
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 4>You just haven't acknowledged it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not concerned.</v>

2051
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:56.163
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to say that you're an </v>

2052
01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.264
<v Speaker 4>anarchist and you don't acknowledge it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because you want to break down all </v>

2053
01:34:00.461 --> 01:34:01.294
<v Speaker 4>power structures and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people want the government where you </v>

2054
01:34:04.331 --> 01:34:06.670
<v Speaker 4>just wrote municipalities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the function of government.</v>

2055
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 4>The government should make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>those programs run efficiently,</v>

2056
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.053
<v Speaker 4>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have access to other people are </v>

2057
01:34:11.621 --> 01:34:13.300
<v Speaker 4>paving roads and that sort of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2058
01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 4>the infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that is an important thing.</v>

2059
01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I think might bust up your conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

2060
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.460
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our priorities are not commerce.</v>

2061
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.323
<v Speaker 4>Our priorities are creating a nourishing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the communities that we live in </v>

2062
01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:30.690
<v Speaker 4>supporting and loving one another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so according to each,</v>

2063
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:34.890
<v Speaker 4>according to their needs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that commerce that is common,</v>

2064
01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:38.403
<v Speaker 4>this call it community ism is community </v>
<v Speaker 4>is we make the community the most </v>

2065
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:43.084
<v Speaker 4>important thing and the w.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the community has to do is empower </v>

2066
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:46.294
<v Speaker 4>the individual and love the individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>and acknowledged that we in our history </v>

2067
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:54.070
<v Speaker 4>of colonization and war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have hurt and damaged one another and</v>

2068
01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:54.904
<v Speaker 4>people are carrying trauma and pain from</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your anorexia and racial abuse is </v>

2069
01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:01.394
<v Speaker 4>another lesson for me are prime examples</v>
<v Speaker 4>of exactly that and it to you for the </v>

2070
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 4>way that you have alchemize that into </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual potency,</v>

2071
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think we should be getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>off the train too early.</v>

2072
01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:17.780
<v Speaker 4>Why set the bar so low for humankind?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only are we not victims,</v>

2073
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:18.643
<v Speaker 4>we can be glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are not determined by our lower </v>

2074
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:23.630
<v Speaker 4>instincts and the lower aspects of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

2075
01:35:23.631 --> 01:35:26.120
<v Speaker 4>We can continue to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Continue to aspire.</v>

2076
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.860
<v Speaker 4>The thing is is that when I asked you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>draw it out,</v>

2077
01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:28.694
<v Speaker 4>your drawing systems that already exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to create anything new and so we </v>

2078
01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.453
<v Speaker 4>can't look good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can look back into the history </v>

2079
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:37.040
<v Speaker 4>and see how it worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Communism.</v>

2080
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Now hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not drawing things that.</v>

2081
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 4>Hold a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mao was hardly.</v>

2082
01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Decentralist was so serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Centralized power and bureaucracy.</v>

2083
01:35:46.631 --> 01:35:47.464
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he raised that uprising that you're </v>

2084
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:50.990
<v Speaker 4>talking about the proletariat versus the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rich people,</v>

2085
01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.540
<v Speaker 4>but you need an asset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your you,</v>

2086
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.750
<v Speaker 4>your wire riding on the wave of </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemporary populism and populism.</v>

2087
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:59.510
<v Speaker 4>As Steve Bannon says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could go either way.</v>

2088
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 4>It could go either way.</v>

2089
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary people go,</v>

2090
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:03.314
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really going to help me to </v>

2091
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:05.054
<v Speaker 4>deregulate the already powerful people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are trotting around the globe like </v>

2092
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.740
<v Speaker 4>ogres or we could through this wave of </v>
<v Speaker 4>populism,</v>

2093
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.670
<v Speaker 4>empower community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>empower ordinary people,</v>

2094
01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:17.504
<v Speaker 4>and we are all ordinary people </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately in spite of our various </v>

2095
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 4>individual skills and they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the word capitalism.</v>

2096
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the the goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your individual should be the goal.</v>

2097
01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:30.284
<v Speaker 4>I just send a message and be rewarded </v>
<v Speaker 4>this much and you decided that the </v>

2098
01:36:34.251 --> 01:36:35.084
<v Speaker 4>balance in your life is that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead go and gifts the community more </v>

2099
01:36:37.611 --> 01:36:40.250
<v Speaker 4>that should be allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why should you be able to govern how</v>

2100
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:42.890
<v Speaker 4>much I give to the community versus how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much I get to myself.</v>

2101
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:44.960
<v Speaker 4>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes you a dictator.</v>

2102
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.883
<v Speaker 4>You decided that you know so well about </v>
<v Speaker 4>society that you're going to sell </v>

2103
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:48.843
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

2104
01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying the big year,</v>

2105
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 4>like the concepts that you're preaching </v>
<v Speaker 4>here because you don't like to name what</v>

2106
01:36:54.771 --> 01:36:55.730
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2107
01:36:55.731 --> 01:36:56.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't like it when I say social.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2108
01:36:56.881 --> 01:36:57.621
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2109
01:36:57.621 --> 01:36:58.454
<v Speaker 4>you drew you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're basically telling us and this </v>

2110
01:37:00.021 --> 01:37:03.120
<v Speaker 4>entire podcast and the next minute you </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2111
01:37:03.121 --> 01:37:04.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm a consultant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bit of both.</v>

2112
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Communist,</v>

2113
01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:12.450
<v Speaker 4>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are times when the old divide,</v>

2114
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.903
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the old polarities are starting to </v>

2115
01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:16.454
<v Speaker 4>dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While we feel like people are becoming </v>

2116
01:37:18.021 --> 01:37:22.400
<v Speaker 4>more and more opposed to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're becoming closer and closer</v>

2117
01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.560
<v Speaker 4>to rejecting the systems that oppress </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

2118
01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:25.543
<v Speaker 4>not just economically that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are the crumbs I'm talking about </v>

2119
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:30.980
<v Speaker 4>spiritually preventing people from </v>
<v Speaker 4>realizing their potential.</v>

2120
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:34.910
<v Speaker 4>So I do believe in the power of </v>
<v Speaker 4>previously oppressed people,</v>

2121
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.370
<v Speaker 4>but I think to like people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2122
01:37:37.371 --> 01:37:38.204
<v Speaker 4>as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't like to continue to revel in </v>

2123
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:41.990
<v Speaker 4>my misery or this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will want to do.</v>

2124
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:43.993
<v Speaker 4>People do need to progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like to deny like something as God </v>

2125
01:37:48.621 --> 01:37:49.454
<v Speaker 4>historically scarring I slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why would I be scarred by that were </v>

2126
01:37:53.651 --> 01:37:54.484
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is some evidence to suggest that </v>

2127
01:37:55.141 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 4>there is a hereditary</v>

2128
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.023
<v Speaker 3>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even psychological leftist </v>

2129
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:00.023
<v Speaker 3>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably Cambridge because we'll the </v>

2130
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:04.524
<v Speaker 3>same way that we evolve features.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We evolve emotionally and something is </v>

2131
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 3>as recent as that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so ridiculous.</v>

2132
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody feels like it's.</v>

2133
01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has been a slave at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was slavery here too.</v>

2134
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel your slavery pain the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>week?</v>

2135
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm from Essex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we hold hands?</v>

2136
01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery that we both experienced.</v>

2137
01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2138
01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:30.983
<v Speaker 3>that feels so good to acknowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally something that we both feel </v>

2139
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:39.980
<v Speaker 3>might be concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Candice.</v>

2140
01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenny,</v>

2141
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:43.523
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got his picture before pose her </v>

2142
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.373
<v Speaker 3>elegant.</v>

2143
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2144
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.830
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This feels good,</v>

2145
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:53.783
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you think that people should </v>

2146
01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 3>revel in mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to acknowledge pain.</v>

2147
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 3>You have to acknowledge that history has</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2148
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about reparations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pain doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2149
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:11.880
<v Speaker 3>What do we think about against it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be no United Kingdom.</v>

2150
01:39:11.881 --> 01:39:15.480
<v Speaker 3>There will be no United States slippery </v>
<v Speaker 3>slope I've ever heard in my entire life.</v>

2151
01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think it would slip and slide</v>

2152
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:18.390
<v Speaker 3>off quality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2153
01:39:18.391 --> 01:39:19.224
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't.</v>

2154
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 3>It would go into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2155
01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:23.370
<v Speaker 3>but before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we were slaves in Africa,</v>

2156
01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has.</v>

2157
01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:25.443
<v Speaker 3>How has it in their past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how far back do you want to do </v>

2158
01:39:26.981 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 3>operations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roman empire.</v>

2159
01:39:28.730 --> 01:39:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to go back to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do the Italian.</v>

2160
01:39:31.361 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 3>So everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reparations.</v>

2161
01:39:32.551 --> 01:39:33.384
<v Speaker 3>You get what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the slope is so slippery that you </v>

2162
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:37.320
<v Speaker 3>can't make a point in society.</v>

2163
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best reparations,</v>

2164
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:40.343
<v Speaker 3>the most successful people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring lines a system is a line you're </v>

2165
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:45.030
<v Speaker 3>currently saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2166
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:47.250
<v Speaker 3>let's not do any reparation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2167
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe there's no share any </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth.</v>

2168
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:52.320
<v Speaker 3>That's where the lines are currently </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn.</v>

2169
01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that talk about reparations,</v>

2170
01:39:55.561 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 3>they've raised an important point by </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposing the fact that they use,</v>

2171
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:59.783
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great countries about the United </v>

2172
01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States of America,</v>

2173
01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:05.640
<v Speaker 3>entirely founded on stolen his books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about taxation of the rich have</v>

2174
01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:07.590
<v Speaker 3>been stealing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was slavery?</v>

2175
01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was colonialism other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing on a massive scale?</v>

2176
01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.413
<v Speaker 3>You can't have one without the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that slavery still </v>

2177
01:40:15.571 --> 01:40:18.390
<v Speaker 3>exists in Africa today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for people to pretend that we were,</v>

2178
01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:21.390
<v Speaker 3>it was stolen from him like we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>kings and Queens and Africa's a myth.</v>

2179
01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:22.253
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were slaves were sold by our own </v>

2180
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:23.730
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2181
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:26.760
<v Speaker 3>So who are we met at the Africans we met</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Americans.</v>

2182
01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a piece of furniture that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very unfortunate.</v>

2183
01:40:29.101 --> 01:40:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it happened to be.</v>

2184
01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.080
<v Speaker 3>It is unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happens everywhere there.</v>

2185
01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.300
<v Speaker 3>There's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2186
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:37.400
<v Speaker 3>but since the beginning of time there </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been slaves.</v>

2187
01:40:37.401 --> 01:40:38.234
<v Speaker 3>So how do you decide that one black </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaves in America are the ones deserve </v>

2188
01:40:41.461 --> 01:40:42.320
<v Speaker 3>reparations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>

2189
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.940
<v Speaker 3>The slope is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let me tell you something.</v>

2190
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:47.410
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2191
01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2192
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.580
<v Speaker 3>The challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Americans.</v>

2193
01:40:50.581 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Would you rather be in America today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you wish it never happened?</v>

2194
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.650
<v Speaker 4>They single black America and I've met </v>
<v Speaker 4>will tell you if they wish they lived in</v>

2195
01:40:56.651 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Africa to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to know why?</v>

2196
01:40:57.970 --> 01:40:59.800
<v Speaker 4>Because all the opportunities are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2197
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Black Americans today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we banded together would be the 30,</v>

2198
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:03.843
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think number six in terms of the </v>

2199
01:41:04.571 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 4>economy in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you mean band together?</v>

2200
01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:08.930
<v Speaker 4>Like if we said we're going to carol and</v>
<v Speaker 4>little country black Americans,</v>

2201
01:41:08.931 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would be.</v>

2202
01:41:10.121 --> 01:41:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Would be ranked as like that happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2203
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:13.813
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the visa people are talking to </v>

2204
01:41:15.261 --> 01:41:16.094
<v Speaker 4>just my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have self segregation happening in </v>

2205
01:41:17.741 --> 01:41:18.574
<v Speaker 4>America now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about the dumbest thing I've </v>

2206
01:41:19.511 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 4>ever heard in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to be more optimistic.</v>

2207
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't you be more ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you were there.</v>

2208
01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.780
<v Speaker 4>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm a 29.</v>

2209
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that older?</v>

2210
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Young?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Holder young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young.</v>

2212
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.310
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

2213
01:41:33.311 --> 01:41:34.001
<v Speaker 4>We have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

2214
01:41:34.001 --> 01:41:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Let me do this sort of questions that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are easy to make clips out of.</v>

2215
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.130
<v Speaker 4>I might have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jennifer.</v>

2216
01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Things we might have to lift up is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've called you love twice.</v>

2217
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Like six to go see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

2218
01:41:42.461 --> 01:41:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Now we're living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't mean to do it.</v>

2219
01:41:44.991 --> 01:41:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm in love as in an affection towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2220
01:41:47.161 --> 01:41:47.994
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's what I'm.</v>

2221
01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.090
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2222
01:41:49.091 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 4>why can't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because some people find it offensive.</v>

2223
01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 4>I hate the society we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a joke,</v>

2224
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:55.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is know.</v>

2225
01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.443
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the side of trying to create </v>

2226
01:41:57.971 --> 01:41:58.804
<v Speaker 4>leftists only you only elect this would </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull that out of a clip and say it's </v>

2227
01:42:01.061 --> 01:42:02.050
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only left.</v>

2228
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:02.884
<v Speaker 4>This gets mad when a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man opens the door and the real power </v>

2229
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:05.360
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2230
01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2231
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.053
<v Speaker 4>they do because they're dressing it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>as feminism when in reality they're </v>

2232
01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:12.290
<v Speaker 4>gaining power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But power is control over resources.</v>

2233
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:16.390
<v Speaker 4>They just saying something to your soul </v>
<v Speaker 4>rose thing.</v>

2234
01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Of course there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they,</v>

2235
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:19.280
<v Speaker 4>when they freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they try to,</v>

2236
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 4>to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Breck had enough from being nominated to</v>

2237
01:42:21.251 --> 01:42:22.920
<v Speaker 4>the supreme court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was radical feminism.</v>

2238
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 4>He never sexually harass anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never happened.</v>

2239
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:26.643
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure different kind of interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but have a field day with you because </v>

2240
01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:30.430
<v Speaker 4>the things you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2241
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.740
<v Speaker 4>like properly rape is a thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to acknowledge it right now.</v>

2242
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Now listen to A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stop you.</v>

2243
01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:42.590
<v Speaker 4>You're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not scared that I will say for you,</v>

2244
01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 4>which is a wonderful quality and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>human,</v>

2245
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:47.740
<v Speaker 4>where do you think true power lies </v>
<v Speaker 4>within the individual,</v>

2246
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:48.723
<v Speaker 4>within yourself?</v>

2247
01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

2248
01:42:51.581 --> 01:42:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Is it because of the individual on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet is as powerful as Halliburton?</v>

2249
01:42:56.730 --> 01:42:57.563
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you.</v>

2250
01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:01.230
<v Speaker 4>What's your measure of power or ability </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get what you want done,</v>

2251
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.890
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want done?</v>

2252
01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.600
<v Speaker 4>That varies from individual to </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

2253
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:05.434
<v Speaker 4>So the power rests with the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a uniform concept of will and </v>

2254
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:11.130
<v Speaker 4>the people whose will is most easily </v>
<v Speaker 4>exerted.</v>

2255
01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:12.790
<v Speaker 4>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a hierarchy,</v>

2256
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:13.743
<v Speaker 4>so I would say and the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that people are generally born </v>

2257
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 4>into positions where the power was </v>
<v Speaker 4>already had already been accumulating.</v>

2258
01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:21.790
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

2259
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:23.583
<v Speaker 4>But it's definitely true though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to edit this so that </v>

2260
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:29.370
<v Speaker 4>your response will be rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've really changed my mind.</v>

2261
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 4>What you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really changed my mind.</v>

2262
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:36.490
<v Speaker 4>What you said was so insightful and so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2263
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the trailer candies.</v>

2264
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about this thing here.</v>

2265
01:43:42.281 --> 01:43:43.114
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think this is a good question </v>

2266
01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 4>jenny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny wrote this question,</v>

2267
01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:46.853
<v Speaker 4>do you think the old Protestant myth </v>
<v Speaker 4>that working hard and personal </v>

2268
01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 4>responsibility is deployed to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 4>governments</v>

2269
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and authorities from actually helping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2270
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:55.160
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2271
01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2272
01:43:55.581 --> 01:43:56.414
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that we don't want </v>

2273
01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:57.981
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2274
01:43:57.981 --> 01:43:58.814
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe in ourselves on a community </v>

2275
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:01.180
<v Speaker 1>level so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2276
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.053
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal is to realize that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job of a government wasn't supposed to </v>

2277
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.900
<v Speaker 1>be to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>

2278
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.610
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every piece of our lives,</v>

2279
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government in many ways is trying to</v>

2280
01:44:09.351 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 1>replace God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2281
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 1>at people you through like that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with it.</v>

2282
01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:18.400
<v Speaker 1>But statism and post Westphalian tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism simply replace the notion of</v>

2283
01:44:19.731 --> 01:44:22.790
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an omnipotent and that,</v>

2284
01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.710
<v Speaker 1>that that's definitely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2285
01:44:24.711 --> 01:44:28.430
<v Speaker 1>according to my little brain right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about this thing here?</v>

2286
01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:29.913
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask our county West Corp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very sort of important </v>

2287
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:34.970
<v Speaker 1>celebrity type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2288
01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:36.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened there?</v>

2289
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2290
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.410
<v Speaker 1>which ports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's banging into,</v>

2291
01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2292
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I've been used to mean by first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost.</v>

2293
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2294
01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I know Kanye didn't write those sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not how he speaks,</v>

2295
01:44:46.491 --> 01:44:47.324
<v Speaker 1>but Kanye realized very soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the cleanest I can say it </v>

2296
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 1>because I did make a promise to him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't speak about this publicly,</v>

2297
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.773
<v Speaker 1>but Kanye realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very quickly that there no such </v>

2298
01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:00.194
<v Speaker 1>thing as doing politics halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are either fully in and you risk </v>

2299
01:45:03.741 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>everything around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>

2300
01:45:05.301 --> 01:45:06.400
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2301
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you are in life,</v>

2302
01:45:07.671 --> 01:45:10.460
<v Speaker 1>your business negotiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the way that trump did or you're</v>

2303
01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:11.294
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately in this I guess is </v>

2304
01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2305
01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:14.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim always says that she disagrees with </v>

2306
01:45:15.651 --> 01:45:16.484
<v Speaker 1>Kanye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm politically and so for him to cause </v>

2307
01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 1>a tremor in his life all around him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has children,</v>

2308
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:22.191
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2309
01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:23.360
<v Speaker 1>young children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2310
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a risky deal to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2311
01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:27.110
<v Speaker 1>he also has his big adidas deal.</v>

2312
01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:27.943
<v Speaker 1>That's a risky thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go into politics and upon and Maggie </v>

2313
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:32.390
<v Speaker 1>had to talk to trump and the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls hollywood.</v>

2314
01:45:32.391 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what it is,</v>

2315
01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:34.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2316
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all think the same.</v>

2317
01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Every award show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even funny anymore.</v>

2318
01:45:36.921 --> 01:45:37.754
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talk about trump for the next two </v>

2319
01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:39.411
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2320
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've ruined comedy.</v>

2321
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that a cognac,</v>

2322
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.593
<v Speaker 1>it was receiving a lot of heat and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectfully needed to step out of the </v>

2323
01:45:46.641 --> 01:45:47.474
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2324
01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was his entrance into positive</v>

2325
01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:50.893
<v Speaker 1>politics and I was just entrance out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was him tweeting me that caused the </v>

2326
01:45:53.601 --> 01:45:56.720
<v Speaker 1>entire firestorm and it was him tweeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that was the same way out.</v>

2327
01:45:56.721 --> 01:45:58.960
<v Speaker 1>But I deeply respect him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean the.</v>

2328
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like when people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in politics is,</v>

2329
01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it's all consuming.</v>

2330
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:04.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

2331
01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Every layer of your life they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to find everything you've ever </v>

2332
01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:08.444
<v Speaker 1>done in your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to get people to speak out </v>

2333
01:46:10.101 --> 01:46:10.934
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of fights I've had with my </v>

2334
01:46:12.141 --> 01:46:15.350
<v Speaker 1>family because reporters call and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I never said,</v>

2335
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenneth tells me you're this or that.</v>

2336
01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.313
<v Speaker 1>And then your parents obviously think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're telling the truth and they </v>

2337
01:46:20.151 --> 01:46:23.920
<v Speaker 1>get all flustered and they are super </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of you.</v>

2338
01:46:23.921 --> 01:46:24.754
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2339
01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.070
<v Speaker 1>grandpa loves Robert and Granddad </v>
<v Speaker 1>applebee's.</v>

2340
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2341
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:31.140
<v Speaker 1>well I'm his child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2342
01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.960
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's somebody that started his life on a</v>

2343
01:46:32.961 --> 01:46:34.970
<v Speaker 1>sharecropping farm and worked his butt </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2344
01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:35.813
<v Speaker 1>Never said he couldn't do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was black or he was just </v>

2345
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:40.100
<v Speaker 1>advantage because he grew up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>segregated south.</v>

2346
01:46:40.101 --> 01:46:41.620
<v Speaker 1>He just worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept his head down,</v>

2347
01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.473
<v Speaker 1>do what he had to do and found success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know I definitely got my </v>

2348
01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 1>motivation in life from his sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>steady counseling.</v>

2349
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.550
<v Speaker 1>He's like a no nonsense.</v>

2350
01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sounds like an incredible man.</v>

2351
01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do,</v>

2352
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:59.190
<v Speaker 4>what do you feel like success is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>look like for you ultimately?</v>

2353
01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would it feel like success for you?</v>

2354
01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would make you fulfilled?</v>

2355
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Candice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think first and foremost,</v>

2356
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:07.810
<v Speaker 4>cracking the black vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Showing that we're not a monolith,</v>

2357
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:10.370
<v Speaker 4>that we think differently and that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to listen to the policies.</v>

2358
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.213
<v Speaker 4>Not The emotional argument for any group</v>
<v Speaker 4>of individuals to be voting in 90 </v>

2359
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:16.960
<v Speaker 4>percent margins for one party shows you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that at,</v>

2360
01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:20.130
<v Speaker 4>especially when that party has never </v>
<v Speaker 4>done anything that has served you,</v>

2361
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:21.143
<v Speaker 4>shows you that we've made an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>investment into politics and ultimately </v>

2362
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:25.770
<v Speaker 4>harmed our personal lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do not think is significantly.</v>

2363
01:47:25.771 --> 01:47:26.604
<v Speaker 4>There are only two parties in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neither of those parties meaningfully </v>

2364
01:47:29.311 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 4>represent the interests of people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been oppressed.</v>

2365
01:47:32.581 --> 01:47:34.470
<v Speaker 4>I think trump represents a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

2366
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:36.190
<v Speaker 4>but because he's independent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all hate them.</v>

2367
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:37.043
<v Speaker 4>Everybody hated trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't know my average except for the </v>

2368
01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:40.530
<v Speaker 4>American people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could ask these people,</v>

2369
01:47:40.531 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 4>I in trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trump being hated an independent.</v>

2370
01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't help ordinary people because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

2371
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.220
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2372
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 4>he's bringing jobs back to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were selling our soul overseas and we</v>

2373
01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 4>were there teaching us to hate being </v>
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>

2374
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:57.420
<v Speaker 4>That teaching on industrializing are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually factories and manufacturing.</v>

2375
01:47:57.421 --> 01:48:00.870
<v Speaker 4>Jobs are coming back and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really true though,</v>

2376
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.200
<v Speaker 4>because you know how they let you work </v>
<v Speaker 4>in politics more than I do.</v>

2377
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a game.</v>

2378
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of truth in that world</v>

2379
01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 4>alive aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2380
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2381
01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.453
<v Speaker 4>it's not that different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I travel six days a week and </v>

2382
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 4>I traveled to every state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even to Hawaii.</v>

2383
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:19.890
<v Speaker 4>The love and comfort in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who looks after you?</v>

2384
01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

2385
01:48:22.150 --> 01:48:22.983
<v Speaker 4>She snapped her.</v>

2386
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her name is bear.</v>

2387
01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear really have so much in common.</v>

2388
01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2389
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:33.780
<v Speaker 4>but also my bear will beat your barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Disagree?</v>

2390
01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so because he's like a mad</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman for cat or fast.</v>

2391
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.433
<v Speaker 4>She left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ally takes out a wall at the top of the </v>

2392
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:43.550
<v Speaker 4>top of the food chain because you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the problem is?</v>

2393
01:48:43.551 --> 01:48:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2394
01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.850
<v Speaker 4>that dog is a painting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2395
01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna get into the dock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got sandwiched.</v>

2396
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:50.030
<v Speaker 4>Painted nails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Important though.</v>

2397
01:48:50.031 --> 01:48:53.990
<v Speaker 4>We should maybe another time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of these days when people.</v>

2398
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Are you pretty strong when them people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are protesting,</v>

2399
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:58.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your career,</v>

2400
01:48:58.370 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2401
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:00.023
<v Speaker 4>like I've watched some videos where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people protesting the back and </v>

2402
01:49:02.071 --> 01:49:04.060
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hold yourself together world.</v>

2403
01:49:04.061 --> 01:49:06.060
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're totally like insane.</v>

2404
01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.840
<v Speaker 4>But then you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't,</v>

2405
01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 4>why don't you feel like this is what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like I watched,</v>

2406
01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:13.373
<v Speaker 4>like right when people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm fascinated and I kind of </v>

2407
01:49:15.481 --> 01:49:17.490
<v Speaker 4>admire the bravery I got to say that.</v>

2408
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:18.663
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do not feel like that you want to </v>

2409
01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:24.090
<v Speaker 4>receive and give love to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that not,</v>

2410
01:49:24.150 --> 01:49:26.390
<v Speaker 4>is that not sort of high on your agenda?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2411
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.360
<v Speaker 4>of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I do.</v>

2412
01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I received so much love because once </v>
<v Speaker 4>people have this political awakening,</v>

2413
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:32.043
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they realized that everything has </v>

2414
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:33.984
<v Speaker 4>been sold to them as lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing feels better than self </v>

2415
01:49:35.441 --> 01:49:37.380
<v Speaker 4>empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually feeling like you can do it when</v>

2416
01:49:37.381 --> 01:49:38.700
<v Speaker 4>it comes within you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2417
01:49:38.701 --> 01:49:42.000
<v Speaker 4>he is a strong emotion but doesn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>as good as love.</v>

2418
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.073
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying my life sucks because of all of </v>

2419
01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:45.834
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel as good as saying I can </v>

2420
01:49:47.291 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 4>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course when you mean personal value,</v>

2421
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.753
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like that is not the clearest and </v>

2422
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:57.340
<v Speaker 4>most obvious manifestation manifestation</v>
<v Speaker 4>of love from my family.</v>

2423
01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.273
<v Speaker 4>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

2424
01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Because the most obvious manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of love that I can think of is to accept</v>

2425
01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:05.860
<v Speaker 4>and understand other people that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have had different experiences to you in</v>

2426
01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:06.694
<v Speaker 4>life and that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I accept that we're always going to </v>

2427
01:50:09.431 --> 01:50:10.450
<v Speaker 4>have different experiences.</v>

2428
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:11.283
<v Speaker 4>That's called life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't create a system where </v>

2429
01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:15.080
<v Speaker 4>everybody is equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist in module ring,</v>

2430
01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't exist.</v>

2431
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.770
<v Speaker 4>That's utopia there though before we got</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire station.</v>

2432
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:23.520
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

2433
01:50:23.521 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 4>I look for love in my personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't look for love in my,</v>

2434
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 4>in my political life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that when you know your why</v>

2435
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:30.034
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why should the political will be </v>

2436
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.140
<v Speaker 4>exempted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're human beings because what I,</v>

2437
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:38.260
<v Speaker 4>what I am doing is giving them the power</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go into their personal lives and,</v>

2438
01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:39.094
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel cold beer candies is what </v>

2439
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.490
<v Speaker 4>you're actually doing is wrangling them </v>
<v Speaker 4>into this,</v>

2440
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:45.383
<v Speaker 4>into sort of a corralling them into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>position where the most powerful people </v>

2441
01:50:49.181 --> 01:50:51.310
<v Speaker 4>in the world can continue to benefit </v>
<v Speaker 4>from them.</v>

2442
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Because whilst I agree that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>bogus sort of lefty,</v>

2443
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.113
<v Speaker 4>Democrat people that contribute a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the debate and I don't support the sort </v>

2444
01:50:58.421 --> 01:50:59.254
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mainstream media and the narratives </v>

2445
01:51:02.231 --> 01:51:03.064
<v Speaker 4>that they put forward in like the cuffs </v>
<v Speaker 4>in new arguing very articulately and </v>

2446
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.470
<v Speaker 4>brilliantly with people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that the most people,</v>

2447
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.240
<v Speaker 4>powerful people in the world will </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit if other.</v>

2448
01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.093
<v Speaker 4>If people believe in individual power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do need to collect the virus to </v>

2449
01:51:14.411 --> 01:51:18.310
<v Speaker 4>challenge power is the only way we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever change the collectivization.</v>

2450
01:51:18.311 --> 01:51:19.930
<v Speaker 4>That's the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that that's a terrible,</v>

2451
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:23.280
<v Speaker 4>terrible thing for community is what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall.</v>

2452
01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Even communities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course by collectivism,</v>

2453
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 4>collectivism leads to communism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's important to acknowledge</v>

2454
01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:31.714
<v Speaker 4>the individuals to be the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big argument is we don't have to be </v>

2455
01:51:34.901 --> 01:51:37.630
<v Speaker 4>defined by our history that we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>create new futures,</v>

2456
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:38.583
<v Speaker 4>so collective and community based </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideologies need and automatically lead </v>

2457
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.260
<v Speaker 4>to state communism in the Gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me though,</v>

2458
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I only spent 10 minutes and I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going quite well.</v>

2459
01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:53.170
<v Speaker 4>We had a lovely Democrat community.</v>

2460
01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 4>You did okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

2461
01:51:57.301 --> 01:51:58.390
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't,</v>

2462
01:51:58.640 --> 01:51:59.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say what the role of government was </v>

2463
01:52:00.671 --> 01:52:02.360
<v Speaker 4>going to be and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look it,</v>

2464
01:52:02.370 --> 01:52:06.430
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to say with the snowflakes,</v>

2465
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:07.620
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I meditate.</v>

2466
01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:10.000
<v Speaker 4>We're not special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snowflakes were not original.</v>

2467
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Every system has turned into nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been.</v>

2468
01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 4>It's been trying to be a blizzard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Storm,</v>

2469
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:23.850
<v Speaker 4>snow cats where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no question.</v>

2470
01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:25.240
<v Speaker 4>That's what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

2471
01:52:25.241 --> 01:52:26.074
<v Speaker 4>very wonderful bug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think you must be a bit more kind to </v>

2472
01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.113
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Compassionate for people that feel like </v>

2473
01:52:32.110 --> 01:52:34.090
<v Speaker 4>in my face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling me a white supremacist.</v>

2474
01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.293
<v Speaker 4>It's not nice to Shriek at people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you to find compassion in </v>

2475
01:52:37.811 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 4>my belly when I'm being shrieked and </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the white supremacists.</v>

2476
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.450
<v Speaker 4>Somebody read a guardian or don't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry.</v>

2477
01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 4>What did our Lord do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fat.</v>

2478
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Forgive them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know not what they do.</v>

2479
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>endless forgiveness,</v>

2480
01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.270
<v Speaker 4>endless love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do love life.</v>

2481
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:53.143
<v Speaker 4>You've been put in a position of power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you have an obligation to be </v>

2482
01:52:56.190 --> 01:52:58.010
<v Speaker 4>loving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your first obligation,</v>

2483
01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:58.853
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to be a practical because I don't </v>

2484
01:53:00.231 --> 01:53:02.130
<v Speaker 4>think you've been given her enough love </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this grand.</v>

2485
01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Sounds absolutely amazing that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a little kid,</v>

2486
01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:09.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean now all that crap in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>media and I love it.</v>

2487
01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2488
01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 4>But with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know my grandma who passed Nola,</v>

2489
01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:17.750
<v Speaker 4>Nolan rock sound terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People such,</v>

2490
01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they say that they're there.</v>

2491
01:53:22.111 --> 01:53:22.944
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well because I was trying to assert </v>

2492
01:53:23.871 --> 01:53:24.704
<v Speaker 4>control in my life and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was the way that I dealt with </v>

2493
01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I have.</v>

2494
01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:29.470
<v Speaker 4>What about other people who have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 4>a wreck?</v>

2495
01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you start to them back up?</v>

2496
01:53:31.810 --> 01:53:32.900
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2497
01:53:32.901 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 4>I understand it.</v>

2498
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:34.933
<v Speaker 4>Obviously on a more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the same way that you would </v>

2499
01:53:35.751 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 4>understand drug addiction on a more </v>
<v Speaker 4>molecular level because you've lived it.</v>

2500
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I would tell them that they need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify what they're trying to control.</v>

2501
01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.390
<v Speaker 4>When I'm talking to drug addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say this,</v>

2502
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:47.090
<v Speaker 4>some were wearing new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do not think that you are beautiful.</v>

2503
01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:47.953
<v Speaker 4>You have been hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a way out of this pain for </v>

2504
01:53:49.941 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 4>spiritual connection to one another </v>
<v Speaker 4>through service,</v>

2505
01:53:52.761 --> 01:53:53.594
<v Speaker 4>through higher ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to recognize your own beauty and to </v>

2506
01:53:55.701 --> 01:53:57.090
<v Speaker 4>realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the sort of thing,</v>

2507
01:53:57.091 --> 01:53:58.430
<v Speaker 4>and I have to say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2508
01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:03.580
<v Speaker 4>it's not God different though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it is.</v>

2509
01:54:03.741 --> 01:54:05.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't give that pep speech.</v>

2510
01:54:05.511 --> 01:54:07.540
<v Speaker 4>They look at you and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2511
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:09.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be the anorexics.</v>

2512
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:11.800
<v Speaker 4>I've never known such complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.480
<v Speaker 4>it's very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is,</v>

2514
01:54:14.481 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 4>but I have to believe that love is more </v>
<v Speaker 4>important than hate.</v>

2515
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:21.810
<v Speaker 4>That unity and togetherness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More powerful than individually,</v>

2516
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 4>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But once you.</v>

2517
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Once you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to empower anybody videos.</v>

2518
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I do not want to be the same person that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>

2519
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:29.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be treated like where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same person.</v>

2520
01:54:29.490 --> 01:54:32.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be the same person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>a person around me is.</v>

2521
01:54:32.121 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be treated as if we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>the exact same person and you can cookie</v>

2522
01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:37.220
<v Speaker 4>cut society and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2523
01:54:37.221 --> 01:54:39.380
<v Speaker 4>this is what Qantas likes for breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that must be.</v>

2524
01:54:39.381 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 4>We're all just going to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>cereal for breakfast.</v>

2525
01:54:41.481 --> 01:54:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that we are individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should celebrate the individual.</v>

2526
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:46.383
<v Speaker 4>The individual should come together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>form a community that takes care of </v>

2527
01:54:48.651 --> 01:54:50.840
<v Speaker 4>issues for individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't take care of themselves.</v>

2528
01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 4>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this,</v>

2529
01:54:53.601 --> 01:54:54.434
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you be willing if over time when </v>

2530
01:54:57.171 --> 01:55:00.170
<v Speaker 4>human beings come up with better ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as human beings evolve,</v>

2531
01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:03.620
<v Speaker 4>if better ideas than free market </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism were to emerge,</v>

2532
01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 4>would you be open to those ideas?</v>

2533
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 4>I love ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was something better,</v>

2534
01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:14.060
<v Speaker 4>a better idea then globalized free </v>
<v Speaker 4>market capitalism exists in the realm of</v>

2535
01:55:14.061 --> 01:55:14.894
<v Speaker 4>infinite possibility through which all </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized it must have surely have </v>

2536
01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 4>traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There exists now,</v>

2537
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 4>better ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas that are more fair,</v>

2538
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 4>more just they are there waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

2539
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 4>these ideas and when they arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they will,</v>

2540
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:33.620
<v Speaker 4>you will be open to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will be the first person that opens my</v>

2541
01:55:33.621 --> 01:55:34.454
<v Speaker 4>loving arms and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come here and new idea that's going to </v>

2542
01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:41.471
<v Speaker 4>fix everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we probably just need 10,</v>

2543
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:47.540
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes with my pant and be willing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to in that direction.</v>

2544
01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.573
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I think we've done as much as we </v>

2545
01:55:50.881 --> 01:55:54.050
<v Speaker 4>can given the limitations that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously working with them.</v>

2546
01:55:54.051 --> 01:55:54.900
<v Speaker 4>What do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>candice?</v>

2547
01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:56.073
<v Speaker 4>It's been lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Been good at it because we're </v>

2548
01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 4>essentially disagree on almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

2549
01:56:01.111 --> 01:56:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Then agree quite strongly on some </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2550
01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what is.</v>

2551
01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I've just taken a step further like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually agree with me.</v>

2552
01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:08.694
<v Speaker 4>I'd absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything that I'm saying you just </v>

2553
01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.360
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just had it plugged it in.</v>

2554
01:56:12.210 --> 01:56:16.620
<v Speaker 4>You just haven't plugged it in to </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that it's actually a capitalist,</v>

2555
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:17.454
<v Speaker 4>not crony capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a capitalist society with free </v>

2556
01:56:19.141 --> 01:56:20.910
<v Speaker 4>markets that helps with people out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>poverty.</v>

2557
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.340
<v Speaker 4>It's one steps off and these massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulation.</v>

2558
01:56:23.341 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 4>We've seen the results of that walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk in,</v>

2559
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:29.070
<v Speaker 4>and then I took one step and you're here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

2560
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:34.380
<v Speaker 4>come back to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So hopefully I helped you a little bit.</v>
