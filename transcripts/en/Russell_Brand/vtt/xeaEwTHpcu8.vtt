10
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.423
<v Speaker 1>the Imani and how Russia helped Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump when at a book that has captured </v>

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the imagination of the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America is doing phenomenally well.</v>

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why this book is so successful,</v>

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.063
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because it tells the Russian </v>

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 2>half of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically we have a,</v>

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.813
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it an alleged conspiracy </v>

17
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>involving a group of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many working for,</v>

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.513
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for trump's campaign and indeed </v>

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>allegedly trump himself and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a group of Russians.</v>

20
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot is known about the Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the story about Donald Trump,</v>

22
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 2>his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>

23
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>jr jared Kushner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president's son of Noah and so on.</v>

24
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but less is known about the oligarchs,</v>

25
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence officers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>and also the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what happened last year,</v>

27
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owes a big debt to,</v>

28
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.194
<v Speaker 2>to the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say to the methods of the </v>

29
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:26.304
<v Speaker 2>KGB,</v>

30
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.723
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

31
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously intrigued because while you </v>

32
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>were explaining that it's becomes clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what we're talking about is the,</v>

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.833
<v Speaker 1>is how power operates covertly and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of alliances that are formed in </v>

34
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:43.564
<v Speaker 1>order to achieve power sometimes and con</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in this case unconventional or at </v>

35
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>least novel relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to explain to me,</v>

36
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please look,</v>

37
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>what are the key relationships that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining trump's ascent?</v>

38
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story goes back a long way,</v>

39
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 2>but I think to explain it in a way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to kind of explain how,</v>

40
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Vladimir Putin thinks.</v>

41
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a psychologist,</v>

42
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 2>but I spent four years in Moscow working</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a correspondent between 2007 or 2011.</v>

43
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of got to know their kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather dark techniques,</v>

44
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

45
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Vladimir Putin is he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a kind of classic KGB spy.</v>

46
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

47
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 2>he spent his career in the KGB,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it in communist East Germany.</v>

48
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.313
<v Speaker 2>And he's going to worldview is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is predicated on the idea that America </v>

49
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 2>is the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which quite often during the cold war,</v>

50
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 2>that Russia is encircled by hostile </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces,</v>

52
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanting the kgb used to do a lot of,</v>

53
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:45.704
<v Speaker 2>is to try and influence politics in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West European politics and American </v>

54
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>politics in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

55
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 2>and to device kind of strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

56
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:53.634
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is that generally these </v>

57
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>operations back in the 1980s were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly,</v>

58
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.573
<v Speaker 2>but the age of facebook and twitter plus</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are all of these </v>

59
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 2>divisions in America Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I think really open up all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities,</v>

61
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.053
<v Speaker 2>especially with Donald Trump who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who for Vladimir Putin was the perfect </v>

62
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.294
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>

63
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.583
<v Speaker 1>So what we ha ha what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because of [inaudible] experience </v>

64
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.510
<v Speaker 1>as a politician and as a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>covert agent,</v>

65
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.583
<v Speaker 1>you have a type of politics that we w is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what more covert then it would usually </v>

66
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that is,</v>

67
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.453
<v Speaker 1>why is it significant that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a president comes to power via </v>

68
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>relationships with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a previous Lee,</v>

69
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.083
<v Speaker 1>a state that it was previously an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to rather than say through </v>

70
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>alliances with transnational </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations that have explicit interest</v>

71
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.750
<v Speaker 1>in the country where the president is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diego?</v>

72
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

73
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 2>I think transnational corporations don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>hack stuff.</v>

74
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.483
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now a lot of people are kind of the </v>

75
00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Americans hack stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that British hack stuff,</v>

76
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.433
<v Speaker 2>the Russians hack stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what was different about the </v>

77
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 2>election last year was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

78
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.583
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe Washington that </v>

79
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.413
<v Speaker 2>essentially kind of crammed in hackers </v>
<v Speaker 2>or quite often these guys are sort of </v>

80
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 2>freelances cooptive by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

81
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>broken to Democratic Party servers into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's campaign.</v>

82
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.893
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to kind of Donald Trump's campaign </v>

83
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:22.100
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just released one set of emails</v>

84
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>at moments of kind of maximum </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassment for,</v>

85
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 2>for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.350
<v Speaker 2>in the summer of last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Push,</v>

87
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 2>you had a kind of convention and again </v>
<v Speaker 2>in October and what,</v>

88
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.793
<v Speaker 2>we can't say that that trump one thanks </v>
<v Speaker 2>to booton but what we can say was that </v>

89
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.594
<v Speaker 2>Putin was kind of pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to push them across the line and </v>

90
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 2>the v these kinds of kind of hacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>helped that.</v>

91
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know everyone hacks,</v>

92
00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:46.940
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

93
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 2>this was a kind of an attempt if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

94
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 2>to kind of influence the domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>political process from far away.</v>

95
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was kind of different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think it was</v>

96
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.783
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose it's surprising because </v>

97
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.113
<v Speaker 1>America is usually a country where it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally they like to be the people </v>

98
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.334
<v Speaker 1>that's doing the influencing of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples national politics as opposed to </v>

99
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.703
<v Speaker 1>being the recipient or the victim of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose what within it is the idea </v>

100
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that power on a geopolitical level is </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting.</v>

101
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

102
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

103
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.293
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not so much that kind of </v>

104
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 2>power is shifting because Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's face it,</v>

105
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not an especially powerful country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still a nuclear armed state.</v>

106
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has got plenty of tanks,</v>

107
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:29.571
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

108
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>but economically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

109
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 2>not a pass and it hasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of ideas,</v>

110
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't really kind of developed any </v>
<v Speaker 2>great ideas.</v>

111
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:36.974
<v Speaker 2>I think what it is is it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about opportunism that if you are </v>

112
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 2>a kind of unscrupulous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of sovereign power,</v>

113
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do a lot of stuff quite </v>

114
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 2>cheaply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

115
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:49.431
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

116
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 2>the hacking for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was done with phishing emails that,</v>

117
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:54.830
<v Speaker 2>that people clicked on in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night when they were half asleep.</v>

118
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.263
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the other stuff kind of </v>

119
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.244
<v Speaker 2>relatively low budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about this sort of classic kgb </v>

120
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about exploiting,</v>

121
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.921
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

122
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 2>the kind of weakness in western society </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turning it to your own advantage.</v>

123
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not saying preaching can have</v>

124
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 2>created all the problems in America that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they preexisted him,</v>

125
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>but he certainly kind of took advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

126
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose perspective I have is that</v>

127
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:21.454
<v Speaker 1>there's trump obviously anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in politics and current </v>

128
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of this wonderfully new,</v>

129
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:28.774
<v Speaker 1>grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grotesque Avatar upon which we can sort </v>

130
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>of hang our intrigue and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascination.</v>

131
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.003
<v Speaker 1>But for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm really interested because </v>

132
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>of the depth of your experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

133
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the time you've spent in Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the Edward Snowden case.</v>

134
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:48.921
<v Speaker 1>What is it that in particular about </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is a distressing it cause like for</v>

135
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:51.084
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's personally without their breadth </v>

136
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:52.734
<v Speaker 1>and depth of knowledge that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that he's merely an </v>

137
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:59.901
<v Speaker 1>amplification of preexisting phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just more visible version of what's been</v>

138
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of happening anyway.</v>

139
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

141
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>but he's also someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

142
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.543
<v Speaker 2>who the the savior state and it's rushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and successor was very keen to </v>

143
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 2>cultivate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 2>this is a matter of facts and history </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

145
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.100
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is that we're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep on talking about the Cold War,</v>

146
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:22.290
<v Speaker 2>but Donald Trump does something fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>unused.</v>

147
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.124
<v Speaker 2>In the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he married a woman from communist </v>

148
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:25.374
<v Speaker 2>Czechoslovakia and we know from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical art do classified archive </v>

149
00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:29.244
<v Speaker 2>material that sort of checks spies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch a very close eye on the couple in </v>

150
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

151
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 2>talk to Ivanna's father who still live </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the iron curtain.</v>

153
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.293
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever they had on the trumps </v>

154
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:45.340
<v Speaker 2>would have been fed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Moscow is part of a kind of a routine</v>

155
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:46.270
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

156
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.780
<v Speaker 2>and you then fast forward to 1987 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

157
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 2>the citizen Soviet government invites </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump to,</v>

158
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.510
<v Speaker 2>to visit Moscow and an all expenses paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

159
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.543
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered was that the Soviet </v>

160
00:07:58.691 --> 00:07:59.524
<v Speaker 2>ambassador literally got off a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Moscow to New York when with his </v>

161
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 2>daughter to trump tower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw Mr.</v>

162
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Trump and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms,</v>

163
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

164
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 2>you have the most beautiful building in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

165
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of schmoozed him.</v>

166
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 2>He did the kind of schmoozy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be susceptible to schmooze?</v>

167
00:08:14.191 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>You say the daughter said it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>honey to a bee,</v>

168
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 2>basically that trump kind of melted </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

169
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:22.030
<v Speaker 2>that he liked this kind of flattery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition.</v>

170
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.193
<v Speaker 2>There was a series of lunches and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>an official invite the Soviet </v>

171
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 2>we'll bring you to Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

173
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Now what sort of significant about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean two things.</v>

174
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are arranged as travel,</v>

175
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.480
<v Speaker 2>where intourist now interests was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet travel agency.</v>

176
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 2>It was basically the KGB.</v>

177
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I spoken to kind of defectors who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've say,</v>

178
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the travel agency was the kgb so </v>

179
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that we can say without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperbolic,</v>

180
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the KGB brought Donald Trump to Moscow </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1987.</v>

181
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he was staying just off Red </v>

182
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not far away from,</v>

183
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.560
<v Speaker 2>from dead Lenin and from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from sort of famous sort of pantheons of</v>

184
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Soviet heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

185
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 2>his room would've been bugged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly he was,</v>

186
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 2>he was discussing hotel building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in reality this was a classic,</v>

187
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to kind of cultivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

188
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:06.641
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

189
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 2>that he was recruited and was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>striding round,</v>

190
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:10.494
<v Speaker 2>red square wearing a colonel's uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it means that they were interested </v>

191
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 2>in him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

192
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.873
<v Speaker 2>and we also know from kind of leaked </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers from that period why they were </v>

193
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.204
<v Speaker 2>interested in him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were basically the head of the KGB </v>

194
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 2>was berating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

195
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.703
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his office is all around the world </v>

196
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 2>we need to do more to recruit Americans.</v>

198
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.203
<v Speaker 2>And they circulated a personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire for the kind of people </v>

199
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>they were interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted people who were vein,</v>

200
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitious,</v>

201
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.620
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

202
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adulterous,</v>

203
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>perhaps had affairs that could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploited.</v>

204
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.833
<v Speaker 2>We're poor analysts and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you kind of work your way down the </v>

205
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mr.</v>

206
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.301
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless him,</v>

207
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 2>ticks every single box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is there's a,</v>

208
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.883
<v Speaker 2>there's a big backstory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of courtship now that doesn't </v>

209
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 2>mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

210
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.780
<v Speaker 2>we don't know to what degree trump kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cooperative enormous.</v>

211
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:58.614
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is very curious is after this kind </v>

212
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.224
<v Speaker 2>of trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about six weeks later when he's back in </v>

213
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:04.164
<v Speaker 2>the u s he takes out a series of front </v>
<v Speaker 2>page adverts in three newspapers </v>

214
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 2>criticizing Ronald Reagan's foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and he announces,</v>

215
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.413
<v Speaker 2>wait for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thinking about running for </v>

216
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen.</v>

217
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.223
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union collapses and his blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitions take another kind of three </v>

218
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>decades to flourish.</v>

219
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 2>But what you have to understand is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these techniques,</v>

220
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.281
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>

221
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>niece Jeremy trying to do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

222
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to recruit students from </v>
<v Speaker 2>national America.</v>

223
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

224
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>these techniques are old techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>updated for,</v>

225
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 2>for 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>

226
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 2>When you say these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the do you mean the relationship between</v>

227
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Russia and trump and trump's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

228
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 2>sort of aggressive antiestablishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement.</v>

229
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.323
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of wooing of people who might </v>

230
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 2>be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a bit like,</v>

231
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.923
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the Soviet intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew 30 years ago he'd be president of </v>

232
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

233
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.263
<v Speaker 2>But they saw he had possibilities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he might be interesting and he with a </v>

234
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:58.824
<v Speaker 2>range of targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is that trump </v>

235
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:01.464
<v Speaker 2>keeps coming back to Moscow does again </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 90s and then most famously he </v>

236
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 2>does it in 2013 when he hosted the Miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>Universe beauty contest.</v>

237
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.453
<v Speaker 2>And he's hanging out with oligarchs with</v>
<v Speaker 2>mafia guys where people from the </v>

238
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>presidential administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of whom are slapping him on the back</v>

239
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.174
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

240
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.430
<v Speaker 2>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

241
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 2>if you believe the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous dossier by Christopher Steel,</v>

242
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>the sort of British spy who set this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing off,</v>

243
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:22.973
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the cultivation operation </v>
<v Speaker 2>resumed big time about five years ago </v>

244
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 2>and culminated with the Russians helping</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

245
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they made him win because</v>

246
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>millions of people voted for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but helping them,</v>

247
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 2>helping them across the finishing line </v>
<v Speaker 2>in last year's presidential election.</v>

248
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does seem like obviously the </v>

249
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:46.080
<v Speaker 2>fruition of a 30 year relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems sort of on off,</v>

250
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not continuous but on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>off because prior to the election,</v>

251
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between sort of covert</v>

252
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v Speaker 1>relationships between Russia and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures in American public life wasn't </v>

253
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.190
<v Speaker 1>really a story that we were that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

254
00:12:01.191 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it something that you,</v>

255
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.100
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what now is because it wasn't happening?</v>

256
00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean that there hadn't been prayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and um,</v>

257
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.121
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

258
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

259
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:09.831
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked,</v>

260
00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:10.664
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to Americans who are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the intelligence world are more or </v>

261
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:14.834
<v Speaker 2>less doffing their hat and saying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the greatest espionage </v>

262
00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:18.180
<v Speaker 2>operations we ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

263
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:18.860
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

264
00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.693
<v Speaker 2>they admit it was kind of breathtaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I was a writing my book as </v>

265
00:12:22.821 --> 00:12:23.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to write,</v>

266
00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I kind of thriller because it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thriller or that sort of true there,</v>

267
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.533
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of questions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer and one of them is why is Donald </v>

268
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Trump's so nice about Vladimir Putin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say rude about everybody,</v>

269
00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:35.774
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's been rude about </v>

270
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:36.824
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been rude about Theresa May </v>

271
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:39.440
<v Speaker 2>last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been rude about the Germans.</v>

272
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.330
<v Speaker 2>He's rude about his Republican Party </v>
<v Speaker 2>allies.</v>

273
00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 2>He's worried about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the only constant thing that the sun</v>

274
00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:47.090
<v Speaker 2>rising in the morning is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's always nice about Mr Putin.</v>

275
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.690
<v Speaker 2>He says he's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he believes him.</v>

276
00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.171
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

277
00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:52.100
<v Speaker 2>when Putin says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing to do with the hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald,</v>

279
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I believe him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

280
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.460
<v Speaker 2>no one else does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seemingly he believes the KGB Asian,</v>

281
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.000
<v Speaker 2>the x one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

282
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.123
<v Speaker 2>and this is very strange and I can kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of predict confidently the trump will </v>

283
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:05.660
<v Speaker 2>never criticize Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to ask yourself,</v>

284
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.000
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer,</v>

285
00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:11.780
<v Speaker 2>at least according to the steele dossier</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because the Russians have got a whole</v>

286
00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:12.614
<v Speaker 2>load of compromising material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Kompromat on trump dating </v>

287
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 2>back to the 1980s technical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>readouts of his conversations,</v>

288
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 2>agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reports,</v>

289
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

290
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 2>and also allegations that the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch to kind of exotic sex show when he</v>

291
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 2>was in Moscow in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which mail month may not be true.</v>

292
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

293
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 2>patient has enormous leverage over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of the United States.</v>

294
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's a remarkable thing.</v>

295
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.820
<v Speaker 1>It is remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

296
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>is it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise.</v>

298
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what</v>

299
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.083
<v Speaker 1>compromising material would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted of given the stuff that </v>

300
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.910
<v Speaker 1>explicitly like says himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like under stuff that bounces off him.</v>

301
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.453
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

302
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.353
<v Speaker 1>I suppose what's difficult about what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging or in treat part or part of </v>

303
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the intrigue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

304
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.583
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the reference points are like </v>

305
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the 1980s in the Cold War and John Le </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carre's rent to you,</v>

306
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it seems there's something slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic but then the entire atmosphere</v>

307
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>of the type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.653
<v Speaker 1>sort of ethno nationalism and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bravado of trump and sort of a </v>

309
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>other emergent strands of nationalistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

310
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 1>they all swear seem to have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite retrospective about them.</v>

311
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.293
<v Speaker 1>So it's an extraordinary move mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mood that seems to be a prevailing at </v>

312
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

313
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:35.750
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

314
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 1>like you have mentioned what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me,</v>

315
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like millions of people did vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Donald Trump.</v>

316
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.013
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Russian intervention prior </v>

317
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:48.781
<v Speaker 1>to this would've seemed kind of bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

318
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is a very well researched</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're obviously right,</v>

319
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:57.701
<v Speaker 1>but what I suppose is like interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me is what are the other reasons that</v>

320
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 1>somebody like Donald Trump would become </v>
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>

321
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:05.921
<v Speaker 1>What kind of culture becomes susceptible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a figure like Donald Trump?</v>

322
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>What does it tell us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

323
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.683
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the involve that your book is </v>

324
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 1>saying that without the involvement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

325
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.920
<v Speaker 1>he would not have Donald Trump as</v>

326
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.470
<v Speaker 2>the president of the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we should focus on it?</v>

327
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:20.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

328
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:21.704
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite saying that because I </v>

329
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.880
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to multicultural.</v>

330
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:24.714
<v Speaker 2>There have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are all sorts of reasons and as </v>

331
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.490
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

332
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 2>millions of people voted for him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly it's got a lot to do with,</v>

333
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 2>with post 2008 with the financial crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned global corporations,</v>

334
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.084
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there are large numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who just feel they've been kind </v>

335
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:38.894
<v Speaker 2>of cheated by the system and saw trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>has some kind of alternative and all of </v>

336
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:46.450
<v Speaker 2>that is right and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got nothing to do with Russia bat.</v>

337
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.573
<v Speaker 2>It's also true that the hacking of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic party stuff really helped </v>

338
00:15:52.561 --> 00:15:53.394
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a beautiful kind of </v>

339
00:15:54.031 --> 00:15:55.500
<v Speaker 2>campaign weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sorts,</v>

340
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.110
<v Speaker 2>it sort of undermined hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

341
00:15:58.111 --> 00:16:01.380
<v Speaker 2>the curious thing about this whole story</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm pretty certain,</v>

342
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.390
<v Speaker 2>and also having spoken to lots of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Moscow,</v>

343
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

344
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin didn't think that trump would win.</v>

345
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.600
<v Speaker 2>He was the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Russians,</v>

346
00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:10.434
<v Speaker 2>he was the kind of candidate of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy who was going to </v>

347
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 2>discredit hillary so that when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>became president,</v>

348
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.980
<v Speaker 2>she would be weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would,</v>

349
00:16:16.981 --> 00:16:19.950
<v Speaker 2>she would be on the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile,</v>

350
00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:23.220
<v Speaker 2>leaving Russia free to do what it likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the international stage.</v>

351
00:16:23.221 --> 00:16:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

352
00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:26.910
<v Speaker 2>they kind of blew the doors off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump became president.</v>

353
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

354
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.420
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so far as the,</v>

355
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.673
<v Speaker 2>I launched my book in the New New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this kind of atmosphere of hyper </v>

356
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:37.530
<v Speaker 2>partisanship in the states is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of raging.</v>

357
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.680
<v Speaker 2>So all of that chaos is good for Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>

358
00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:41.514
<v Speaker 2>the one thing he really wanted was for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for America under trump to lift </v>

359
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:45.204
<v Speaker 2>sanctions against Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imposed Auntie in 2014 by Obama </v>

360
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.570
<v Speaker 2>following the war in Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that hasn't happened because there's</v>

361
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.404
<v Speaker 2>scandal is just turned into her </v>
<v Speaker 2>monstrously big thing and is being </v>

362
00:16:57.611 --> 00:16:58.444
<v Speaker 2>investigated by Robert Miller who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is kind of beating a path to trump </v>

363
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:03.324
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the special prosecutor looking at </v>

364
00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:04.944
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

365
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my concern is,</v>

366
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.240
<v Speaker 1>is that in this diagnosis of Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement being integral to the ascent</v>

367
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other lessons may be missed,</v>

368
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.873
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the partner Zan atmosphere in </v>

369
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:22.244
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was recently in America and I sort of </v>

370
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.320
<v Speaker 1>sensed a similar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

371
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.470
<v Speaker 1>do you think that this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

372
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:35.010
<v Speaker 1>kind of willingness to blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting it all be it like,</v>

373
00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:35.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

374
00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:36.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said to you,</v>

375
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:37.374
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steele report and the work that you </v>

376
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 1>have done that there is truth in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>

377
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.923
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

378
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

379
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.893
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there's a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly a sort of a kind of a desire </v>

380
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.333
<v Speaker 1>democratic left sort of center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left leaning liberal thinking people </v>

381
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>just to sort of find a reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Donald Trump is president?</v>

382
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.093
<v Speaker 1>There isn't because of the massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of liberalism to take care of </v>

383
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the people that it was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent.</v>

384
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

385
00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get that and I think your,</v>

386
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.760
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're basically correct,</v>

387
00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

388
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a complex world and two things can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be true simultaneously.</v>

389
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Liberalism as you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have failed.</v>

390
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton may have been a weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate who fell to inspire.</v>

391
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie may have been given a tough time </v>

392
00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:24.070
<v Speaker 2>by the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

393
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.930
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's face it,</v>

394
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.820
<v Speaker 2>for all of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

395
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.910
<v Speaker 2>for all of his kind of recklessness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something pretty mesmeric about</v>

396
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 2>listening to him speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if he only says the same thing four</v>

397
00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:38.050
<v Speaker 2>or five times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

398
00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:41.880
<v Speaker 2>he does have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of rhetorical Pi,</v>

399
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 2>you have aura almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to recognize all of that.</v>

400
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.820
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't help him.</v>

401
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:48.654
<v Speaker 2>And that the point is that this is sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of seriousness that this is sort of </v>

402
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 2>serious because you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate,</v>

403
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you had one group of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a relatively low tech.</v>

404
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Bloc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate was the packing room,</v>

405
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 2>his seventies with burglars and rubber </v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves and lock pigs.</v>

406
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.133
<v Speaker 2>But he had one group of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>smearing another group of Americans in </v>

407
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a totally disreputable way.</v>

408
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 2>And then Richard Nixon covering up </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

409
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 2>What you've got here is one group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

410
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically invoking that,</v>

411
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.243
<v Speaker 2>a sort of traditional adversary of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States and getting them to help </v>

412
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.940
<v Speaker 2>chop the legs off an opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

413
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>now that is different territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I called my book collusion,</v>

414
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 2>but we're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not there yet,</v>

415
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 2>but we're kind of heading into the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of treason zone.</v>

416
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more serious than a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic political squabble.</v>

417
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think the worry is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the failure of liberalism as you</v>

418
00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:36.860
<v Speaker 2>put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

419
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.790
<v Speaker 2>is that what it tells us is that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracies are more fragile.</v>

420
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two external manipulation of all kinds.</v>

421
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Then we might've thought yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also</v>

422
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.523
<v Speaker 1>like in a way that's quite evident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious in terms of the experience of </v>

423
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:54.640
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people in a sort of post </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalized world.</v>

424
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.271
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:56.104
<v Speaker 1>cause there's sort of that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the analytical strand that would </v>

426
00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:01.564
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that would suggest that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that trump became popular is </v>

427
00:20:05.111 --> 00:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an emotional experience that people</v>

428
00:20:09.011 --> 00:20:09.844
<v Speaker 1>are voting for trump voters are having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy seems to understand how I </v>

429
00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:16.440
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

430
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.283
<v Speaker 1>while that doesn't make rational sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're dealing with the </v>

431
00:20:20.531 --> 00:20:21.364
<v Speaker 1>rationale.</v>

432
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's,</v>

433
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:23.844
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of crucial point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that in a way is why it's so </v>

434
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:26.454
<v Speaker 2>alarming is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that trump has a kind of master </v>

435
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>of this emotionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

436
00:20:29.281 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I've got people kind of one storing my </v>
<v Speaker 2>review who bought an egg whisk on Amazon</v>

437
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:35.790
<v Speaker 2>and then put one star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my book.</v>

438
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.803
<v Speaker 2>Even though they haven't read it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought it because they just don't like </v>

439
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:40.550
<v Speaker 2>the idea in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

440
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

441
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no more important than what's true.</v>

442
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.013
<v Speaker 2>What's kind of empirically real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's important is what people can be </v>

443
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:49.780
<v Speaker 2>made to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

444
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a great sort of relativist strand in,</v>

445
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 2>in Russian thinking in Soviet thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

446
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.164
<v Speaker 2>it was Vladimir Lenin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy behind the Bolshevik revolution </v>

447
00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.643
<v Speaker 2>a century ago who basically said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that truth was subordinate to the class </v>

448
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>

449
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 2>There was a kind of higher truth which </v>
<v Speaker 2>out truth,</v>

450
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>the real truth of what what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of going on.</v>

451
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.993
<v Speaker 2>And in a way what patient has done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of cynically take that idea and </v>

452
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 2>reproduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he doesn't need to persuade everybody</v>

453
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 2>that Donald Trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

454
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 2>is a great guy and that he's a faithful </v>
<v Speaker 2>husband and all the rest of it.</v>

455
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 2>But he just needs to kind of persuade a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain number of people that that's the</v>

456
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that truth,</v>

457
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a kind of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth,</v>

458
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it feels still with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

459
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's quite scary because </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately it's a kind of,</v>

460
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.570
<v Speaker 2>where we are now is it's almost like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault on,</v>

461
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.980
<v Speaker 2>on rationality and the idea of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

462
00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 2>of a uni truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

463
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 2>But where does politics have to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that place,</v>

464
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:43.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see like the,</v>

465
00:21:43.341 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 2>in a way they're sort of trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

466
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether or not it's treason.</v>

467
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:47.843
<v Speaker 2>Literally his treats him for another </v>
<v Speaker 2>state to intervene in the democratic </v>

468
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:50.970
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

469
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second nation.</v>

471
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it is.</v>

472
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 2>But like powerful entities continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervene in the democratic process.</v>

473
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So in a way we were already dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that phenomena is just here.</v>

474
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems quite defiant and bold it oh,</v>

475
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:08.374
<v Speaker 2>bloody hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's literally the Russians as well </v>

476
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 2>as this sort of hyper aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

477
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.273
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it over the last year that the </v>

478
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Democrats had been in disarray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's face it,</v>

479
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 2>British politics hasn't been in great </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>

480
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is it's been sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

481
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been people in civic society,</v>

482
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 2>it's been activists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

483
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.843
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been infested with Janice like </v>

484
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 2>myself who've almost be kind of filling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filling the gap.</v>

485
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 2>And I sort of make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make kind of two quick please.</v>

486
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 2>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need,</v>

487
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I think in our trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confusing times.</v>

488
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.650
<v Speaker 2>We need good method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be evidential.</v>

489
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 2>We need to kind of admit when we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

490
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.293
<v Speaker 2>the facts might change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we need to kind of be humble in the </v>

491
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:49.150
<v Speaker 2>face of some very kind of complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

492
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing I would say is so an</v>

493
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 2>urge people to kind of buy newspapers if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the Guardian by something</v>

494
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.080
<v Speaker 2>else or just contribute to news because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>

495
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.230
<v Speaker 2>we need people doing this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more than ever.</v>

496
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 2>But it feels to me that these categories</v>
<v Speaker 2>are being challenged.</v>

497
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even of a nation state,</v>

498
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I think people are starting to feel this</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work for me any more.</v>

499
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.600
<v Speaker 2>They're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

500
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 2>the United States of America doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent my interests.</v>

501
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a veil that's placed </v>
<v Speaker 2>between me and power.</v>

502
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 2>And now like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>

503
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:24.004
<v Speaker 2>that the trump becomes a sort of gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grotesque example of what's proceeded </v>

504
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:28.864
<v Speaker 2>in Tfa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is something I've been </v>

505
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 2>mentioned in ever since I heard it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this room.</v>

506
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the academic Kai Hindi,</v>

507
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.913
<v Speaker 2>Andrew's this sociologist said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is a better president for </v>

508
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:41.104
<v Speaker 2>African Americans and Barack Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>because under Donald Trump we are </v>

509
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>confronted with the truth of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics</v>

510
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 1>actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what race in America actually is,</v>

511
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 1>rather than dealing with the temporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction.</v>

512
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Barack Obama and out like,</v>

513
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in no position either racially or </v>

514
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:57.524
<v Speaker 1>academically to make such an assertion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something about that resonated very </v>

515
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:02.114
<v Speaker 1>deeply with me and it seems like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while we sort of get all anxious about </v>

516
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:06.764
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which agencies are involved in </v>

517
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 1>organizing news empower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key issue is,</v>

518
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.280
<v Speaker 1>are ordinary people being given access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to power?</v>

519
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Are they able to control their lives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

520
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Were they able to prior to Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

521
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Is Donald Trump sort of worse than a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty seeming,</v>

522
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.850
<v Speaker 1>madly sexist and in some instances </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulgar and grotesque,</v>

523
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.693
<v Speaker 1>almost beyond imagination quite clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what concerns me is this sort of </v>

524
00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 1>attempt to sort of scramble backwards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

525
00:24:38.881 --> 00:24:39.714
<v Speaker 1>just can we get back to where we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years ago when it was at least </v>

526
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.320
<v Speaker 1>nice seeming people that were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff less vividly.</v>

527
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.010
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not my thesis.</v>

528
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.913
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant thesis on the involvement of </v>

529
00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>

530
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.593
<v Speaker 2>but what concerns me is that how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be used by neo liberal politicians </v>

531
00:24:57.191 --> 00:24:58.024
<v Speaker 2>in the United States of America to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of try and reinstate what proceeded </v>

532
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.830
<v Speaker 2>trump when the lesson that really needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be learned.</v>

533
00:25:02.831 --> 00:25:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It's politics needs to radically shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that power is organized,</v>

534
00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:07.560
<v Speaker 2>needs to radically shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

535
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:08.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 2>this just Asher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Blair back in or Bill Clinton.</v>

537
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.950
<v Speaker 2>That's not the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

538
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I think I did this disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

539
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of think,</v>

540
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing we need is we need good </v>

541
00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:22.540
<v Speaker 2>storytelling actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

542
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about shifting power </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the people.</v>

543
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:27.810
<v Speaker 2>We need to tell good stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to engage people in,</v>

544
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.550
<v Speaker 2>in this stuff because obviously it </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinates you and it fascinates me.</v>

545
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.080
<v Speaker 2>But it leaves some people kind of cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

546
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

547
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories,</v>

548
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the little mini stories that Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump tells on twitter,</v>

549
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.553
<v Speaker 2>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very emotive that get food to </v>

550
00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:42.520
<v Speaker 2>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

551
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other stories as well.</v>

552
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:48.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my job is to try and,</v>

553
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the areas I understand,</v>

554
00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:52.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and also did lots of stuff on </v>

555
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:53.961
<v Speaker 2>offshore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

556
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the Panama papers,</v>

557
00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:58.170
<v Speaker 2>the paradise papers is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

558
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did Snowden,</v>

559
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I did the Wiki leaks stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done all of these kinds of,</v>

560
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.113
<v Speaker 2>the big investigations last for years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've sort of written books about </v>

561
00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:10.200
<v Speaker 2>most of them is to actually take these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of quite complex themes and to tell</v>

562
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:13.740
<v Speaker 2>them in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a really exciting and racy way,</v>

563
00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it's nonfiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all true.</v>

564
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:15.901
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

565
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:18.300
<v Speaker 2>it's all granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so people can kind of read them,</v>

566
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:21.420
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily scholars or students </v>
<v Speaker 2>from international relations,</v>

567
00:26:21.421 --> 00:26:23.850
<v Speaker 2>but the kind of thing you can read on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the beach or on a train.</v>

568
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh two things that I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in this,</v>

569
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.280
<v Speaker 2>this next beat of the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I want you to,</v>

570
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.323
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read us what you think is the bit that </v>

571
00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:34.920
<v Speaker 2>exemplifies what you've just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then like sort of populist,</v>

572
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:36.120
<v Speaker 2>accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thriller,</v>

573
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.650
<v Speaker 2>right in from this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collusion.</v>

574
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.633
<v Speaker 2>And now I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain this story of Edward </v>

575
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Snowden is like [inaudible] sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

576
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>he roic</v>

577
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>pail of our time and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>

578
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of give,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.830

<v Speaker 1>and the way that it was handled.</v>

582
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>The White Bengal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>donald snowed a that,</v>

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>this all happens for trump's not on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape at this point.</v>

586
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 1>This is all under Obama and this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proceed previous administration.</v>

587
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us like,</v>

588

<v Speaker 1>using your thriller and pop from the Ra </v>

589
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:14.560
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little more about that.</v>

590
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

591
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:20.241
<v Speaker 2>you're teasing how routine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

592
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 2>So what do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Dude.</v>

593
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It's no to one first cause cause he </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to me like a hero.</v>

594
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I can get my chops around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

595
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about snowden is that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of classic whistle blower and,</v>

596
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

597
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I read a book about her man that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of very admiring of him.</v>

598
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially what he was someone from </v>

599
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 2>inside the American intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>community who realized,</v>

600
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his kind of gradual horror that the </v>

601
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 2>United States government and the UK by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

602
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and various kind of Anglo Saxon partners</v>
<v Speaker 2>where hoovering up all of our electronic</v>

603
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:49.644
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether we were criminals </v>

604
00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 2>or old ladies or students doing gcse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all being sucked up.</v>

605
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>web searches,</v>

606
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.950
<v Speaker 2>emails and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

607
00:27:59.951 --> 00:28:02.760
<v Speaker 2>and then that kind of geolocation data </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have from your iphone,</v>

608
00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 2>so where you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

609
00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 2>all of that is recorded every two </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

610
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.683
<v Speaker 2>And there'd be no public debate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation or kind of reckoning as to </v>

611
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:11.334
<v Speaker 2>whether it was appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the volumes had gone from small in </v>

612
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 2>about 2002 massive billions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions a day,</v>

613
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 2>30 billion plus items a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

614
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.440
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he blew the whistle.</v>

615
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 2>He leaked the stuff to my newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guardian.</v>

616
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.560
<v Speaker 2>He fled to Hong Kong and he's now living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in exile in Moscow.</v>

617
00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:29.394
<v Speaker 2>He kind of got stuck there basically by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake and I think he's a kind of </v>

618
00:28:32.721 --> 00:28:33.554
<v Speaker 2>heroic figure who kind of pulled across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the curtain and showed us the real </v>

619
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:42.110
<v Speaker 2>nature of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of of reality in the 21st century and at</v>

620
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:42.944
<v Speaker 2>least allowed us to have a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper conversation with power about </v>

621
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 2>what's appropriate and not appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

622
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was brilliant.</v>

623
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.771
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.604
<v Speaker 1>if that's what's proceeding and trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how significant is the Fisher that he </v>

625
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:55.404
<v Speaker 1>represents in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not like he what proceeded </v>

626
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 1>had any values anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are these they are captured.</v>

627
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So like I can really understand how that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

628
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 1>there is an appetite for trump for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that's like,</v>

629
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

630
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust these people you it or drain the </v>

631
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.084
<v Speaker 1>swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see how that kind of language is </v>

632
00:29:13.421 --> 00:29:15.690
<v Speaker 1>going to be resonant when it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ether.</v>

633
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what proceeded him.</v>

634
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.953
<v Speaker 1>Was that an environment that required </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward Snowden and when it would snow </v>

635
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and does do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like this guy's a hero.</v>

636
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a parade.</v>

637
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Drape him in the Stars and Stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

638
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the guy goes and lives where Russia now </v>
<v Speaker 1>the feelings in this one?</v>

639
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's quite,</v>

640
00:29:32.601 --> 00:29:33.434
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting because obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book that the American </v>

641
00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:39.170
<v Speaker 2>intelligence community didn't much like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there might like this one a bit,</v>

642
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 2>a bit more because I won essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

643
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

644
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.340
<v Speaker 2>there are questions inside Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically what I was told,</v>

645
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.080
<v Speaker 2>having taught a sources here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

646
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.740
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

647
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.200
<v Speaker 2>and in the states a lot is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.133
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inside this intelligence </v>

649
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 2>establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it that.</v>

650
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:57.910
<v Speaker 2>If you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

651
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with what the presence doing.</v>

652
00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:01.284
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally they tend to be kind of more </v>

653
00:30:02.101 --> 00:30:05.400
<v Speaker 2>right leaning than left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Obama,</v>

654
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.440
<v Speaker 2>they might not like what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

655
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:09.210
<v Speaker 2>but essentially they recognize his right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

656
00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:10.044
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes him different is that they </v>

657
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.320
<v Speaker 2>are genuinely asking whether he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot actually,</v>

658
00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:17.154
<v Speaker 2>whether he puts American values or </v>
<v Speaker 2>however you want to call it first </v>

659
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:20.874
<v Speaker 2>American democracy faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether actually he puts his own </v>

660
00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 2>personal and family interests above </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and what deals,</v>

661
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.533
<v Speaker 2>especially financial deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might have cut with Moscow both </v>

662
00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:30.924
<v Speaker 2>recently and in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that we're in a very curious </v>

663
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:34.381
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

664
00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:35.214
<v Speaker 2>we're in a sort of situation where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't entirely know where the real </v>

665
00:30:38.851 --> 00:30:42.810
<v Speaker 2>loyalties of Donald Trump are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are these values?</v>

666
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.370
<v Speaker 1>What are the values that he's breaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>like now,</v>

667
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.090
<v Speaker 1>because I have what I sense the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I sense that he is writing.</v>

668
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it kind of an emergent rage coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the feeling of nihilism coming from</v>

669
00:30:57.331 --> 00:30:59.610
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this then this isn't real.</v>

670
00:30:59.611 --> 00:31:01.480
<v Speaker 1>None of it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

671
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so when people are kind of like,</v>

672
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's an anomaly or now an outrage,</v>

673
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

674
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.580
<v Speaker 1>what are these values?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

675
00:31:11.581 --> 00:31:13.560
<v Speaker 1>of course it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things he said about women,</v>

676
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:15.960
<v Speaker 1>some of the racist stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all disgusting.</v>

677
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:16.794
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this citadel that's being </v>

678
00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:20.034
<v Speaker 1>defended?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seemed like it was pretty </v>

679
00:31:21.181 --> 00:31:22.260
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

680
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.263
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm asking you this as a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that knows a lot about international </v>

681
00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:26.904
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

682
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

683
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

685
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of described ran it,</v>

686
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

687
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

688
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.490
<v Speaker 2>if we can just sort of take a America </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>

689
00:31:37.491 --> 00:31:39.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just kind of your eras </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing until,</v>

690
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.610
<v Speaker 2>could it more generally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

691
00:31:40.611 --> 00:31:41.444
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of,</v>

692
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I've spent a lot of time in my kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>career as a reporter for the Guardian as</v>

693
00:31:44.631 --> 00:31:47.030
<v Speaker 2>a foreign correspondent in war zones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

694
00:31:47.031 --> 00:31:47.864
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in pretty sketchy places in </v>

695
00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and Libya and Iraq and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ashley,</v>

696
00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:56.160
<v Speaker 2>what do you talk to ordinary people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

697
00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:56.994
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that kind of neolistic </v>

698
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.360
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did kind of want,</v>

699
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Speaker 2>they want sort of decency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want kind of healthcare.</v>

700
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.240
<v Speaker 2>They want jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want their kids to have a future.</v>

701
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>They want sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 2>they want governments that change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

703
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:12.390
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of key thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments is that one,</v>

704
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 2>one law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to go in a lot has to come in and</v>

705
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm set fantastically old </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashioned fuel for your program.</v>

706
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:19.324
<v Speaker 2>But I actually do believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in kind of brilliant basic human rights </v>

707
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and universal values were supply </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

708
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 2>whether it's America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

709
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.940
<v Speaker 2>central London or ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we've slightly lost track of</v>

710
00:32:32.941 --> 00:32:33.271
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

711
00:32:33.271 --> 00:32:34.104
<v Speaker 2>and I actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that these places you were a </v>

712
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:38.220
<v Speaker 2>foreigner or Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>

713
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.113
<v Speaker 2>Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all countries chewed up by this thing </v>

714
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 2>that we're trying to preserve and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cherish.</v>

715
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.121
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

716
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not trying to cheer up </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventionism I mean,</v>

717
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:47.384
<v Speaker 2>we're not trying to kind of defend kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these kind of grandiose misconceived </v>

718
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:53.890
<v Speaker 2>imperialistic projects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

719
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting from a position of,</v>

720
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

721
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 2>if you're a war reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it's a very easy thing to do.</v>

722
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.093
<v Speaker 2>It's much more easy to report on war </v>
<v Speaker 2>than is to report on Brexit because you </v>

723
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 2>just talk to ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ask them stories,</v>

724
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you'd ask them about their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids,</v>

725
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 2>why they fled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

726
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 2>what they saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they met,</v>

727
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 2>he pointed a gun at them and he tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>those stories as well.</v>

728
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>My point about storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's really important,</v>

729
00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:17.834
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of elemental that we tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right stories that we tell kind of pro </v>

730
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 2>human stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

731
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.373
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try and seek the truth rather than a </v>

732
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 2>truth and also that we don't totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose faith in,</v>

733
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.093
<v Speaker 2>in humanity and kind of succumb to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil Ism that you were talking about </v>

734
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 2>earlier on and we must never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must never do that.</v>

735
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.820
<v Speaker 2>When you're in your work as a war </v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondent,</v>

736
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:41.654
<v Speaker 2>it becomes clearly human cause it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifiable situation and you feel you </v>

737
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:52.340
<v Speaker 2>can obviously connect with that humanity</v>
<v Speaker 2>until their stories where it was in more</v>

738
00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 2>complex situations.</v>

739
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Somehow it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opaque.</v>

740
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Well it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be very,</v>

741
00:33:58.581 --> 00:33:59.990
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that's the,</v>

742
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the bump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be,</v>

743
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of,</v>

744
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:02.973
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to sort of go and find </v>

745
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>banners and sometimes when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

746
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you actually lose sight of the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

747
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:09.884
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one group of people are shelling of </v>

748
00:34:11.231 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 2>bunch of civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not really he sheds.</v>

749
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.780
<v Speaker 2>She said it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shall,</v>

750
00:34:15.781 --> 00:34:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Ye shall know that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

751
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:19.783
<v Speaker 2>that is the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have little pun there about people </v>

752
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.274
<v Speaker 2>being killed by heavy artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll read us the best bit or not </v>

753
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the best bit a bit of this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

754
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 2>pop you laray and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

755
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

756
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 2>so this book begins with Christopher </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steele,</v>

757
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:37.670
<v Speaker 2>who's the British spy at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

758
00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.553
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went to see him about four weeks </v>

759
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 2>before his famous dossier was published </v>
<v Speaker 2>in January by buzzfeed.</v>

760
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go into his office,</v>

761
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 2>a modest ground floor suite knew this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the best bit straight away.</v>

762
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Cause this is a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do when you do readings.</v>

763
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time anyone's asked me</v>

764
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.440
<v Speaker 2>to read from this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm actually,</v>

765
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually improvising king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

766
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit old school reading.</v>

767
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

768

<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandpa sweet couple of bear rooms </v>

769
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.310
<v Speaker 2>painted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rewire to kind of map of the wwe world</v>

770
00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:08.144
<v Speaker 2>fixed to one wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Christopher Steele's office </v>

771
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.593
<v Speaker 2>lined up near the director's desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the director of this business </v>

772
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:14.684
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

773
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a nesting Russ Russian dolls called</v>

774
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Matryoshka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a souvenir from Moscow.</v>

775
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 2>They feature Russia's great 19th century</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>

776
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gogol,</v>

777
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Lermontov,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pushkin.</v>

778
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say,</v>

779
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.340
<v Speaker 2>and the tumultuous days of 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dolls were as good as a ma,</v>

780
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.283
<v Speaker 2>as good as any metaphor for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing secret investigation had </v>

781
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 2>recently been asked to do.</v>

782
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 2>It was an explosive assignment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncover the Kremlin's inner most secrets</v>

783
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>with relation to one Donald J.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump to undress them one by one.</v>

784
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.103
<v Speaker 2>Like so many dolls until the truth was </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally revealed and it had Russian </v>

785
00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:56.634
<v Speaker 2>belts in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm absent some figures from Russian </v>

786
00:35:58.261 --> 00:35:59.094
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thinking I've wanted to know what was </v>

787
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 2>going to happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read the book,</v>

788
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.570

789
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 2>snatch me out of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bury me in language.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this war that we talked about earlier,</v>

810
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And then we moved to Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>

811
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:12.630
<v Speaker 2>do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the case of my,</v>

812
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the celebrities,</v>

813
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:15.630
<v Speaker 2>my previous book of very expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>poison.</v>

814
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:16.464
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember the case of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander live in Yanco was a Russian </v>

815
00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:20.190
<v Speaker 2>desk dissident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famously,</v>

816
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 2>famously poisoned umbrella.</v>

817
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a brother.</v>

818
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:26.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a radioactive cup of tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

819
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.143
<v Speaker 2>given by two criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assassins in a hotel not too far away </v>

820
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:30.620
<v Speaker 2>from here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

821
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.760
<v Speaker 2>and I arrived shortly after his murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

822
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.653
<v Speaker 2>and I started investigating this story </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was made pretty clear to me in </v>

823
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

824
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.693
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my inquiries were most unwelcome and I </v>

825
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:42.114
<v Speaker 2>had strange guys wearing cheap black </v>
<v Speaker 2>black leather jackets and brown shoes </v>

826
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:47.184
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>following me around the icy streets of </v>

827
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's scary,</v>

828
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 2>mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

829
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.571
<v Speaker 2>hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

830
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:52.404
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the funny bit because that was </v>

831
00:37:53.191 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 2>more kind of clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then kgb,</v>

832
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

833
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

834
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.603
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of okay because they will </v>

835
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:02.210
<v Speaker 2>come and sit next to you in a cafe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why it was clear that,</v>

836
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.280
<v Speaker 2>not like that you wouldn't lie that </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

837
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was that and there was sort of </v>

838
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.910
<v Speaker 2>electronic surveillance as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever I made it kind of phone call</v>

839
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:12.744
<v Speaker 2>or told a joke about Pooja and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a kind of ominous on the phone </v>

840
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:17.154
<v Speaker 2>with a line cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you redialed you make another </v>

841
00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 2>joke about Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was all very demonstrative.</v>

842
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 2>The idea was to sort of show that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were on your case,</v>

843
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 2>that they were listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

844
00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that really,</v>

845
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of disturbed us because I was,</v>

846
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.363
<v Speaker 2>cause I said by kids were at that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>our kids were six and nine was we had a </v>

847
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:42.340
<v Speaker 2>series of breakins at our apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we live in Moscow.</v>

848
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 2>And it was done in a kind of most </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious way.</v>

849
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 2>This is from the kind of KGB manual to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that they've been there.</v>

850
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

851
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:52.534
<v Speaker 2>was when we were living on the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>50th floor of an apartment block in </v>

852
00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:57.214
<v Speaker 2>Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they busted open the the window </v>

853
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:00.813
<v Speaker 2>next to my six year old son's Ikea bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a sort of 20 meter drop to the </v>

854
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 2>courtyard below.</v>

855
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.370
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of broken and left </v>
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>

856
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:07.204
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implying that he might just meet with a </v>

857
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:10.534
<v Speaker 2>little accident and there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>very crude stuff like that family fate </v>

858
00:39:12.891 --> 00:39:14.640
<v Speaker 2>is deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

859
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

860
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:16.481
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

861
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:17.314
<v Speaker 2>we sort of sought advice from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British embassy in Moscow and they </v>

862
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 2>basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are bugged.</v>

863
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:21.311
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

864
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>

865
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might do about this?</v>

866
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Can you get rid of the bugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

867
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we come,</v>

868
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a cup of tea and a biscuit.</v>

869
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 2>You just have to live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had,</v>

870
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:31.283
<v Speaker 2>we were basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we discovered there was video as </v>

871
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have three and a half years before</v>

872
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I was eventually deported from Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>under surveillance in the bedroom,</v>

873
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.380
<v Speaker 2>the living room everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

874
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.273
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason it's relevant is that </v>

875
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:47.344
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sort of try and think about </v>

876
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:52.210
<v Speaker 2>would Putin of tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump in Moscow in 2013,</v>

877
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Betty Wood,</v>

878
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 2>this is what they do.</v>

879
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.413
<v Speaker 2>This is what they did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have a whole technical </v>

880
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:57.844
<v Speaker 2>department that does this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite fixated on sexual </v>

881
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

882
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.793
<v Speaker 2>on one occasion they left a sex manual </v>
<v Speaker 2>bile bed when we'd been away on holiday </v>

883
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:07.340
<v Speaker 2>and Berlin and we came out to discover </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

884
00:40:07.341 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 2>this book in Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 2>lying there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I sort of picked it up and I thought</v>

886
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:15.910
<v Speaker 2>this is the most strange moment of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've what message of the KGB 20%.</v>

887
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a bit frightened mate.</v>

888
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight went out that window bit.</v>

889
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

890
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:22.534
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing is that what they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at is they're sort of try and </v>

891
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 2>find your point of vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for most people is their kids there,</v>

892
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:28.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that something might happen to </v>

893
00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:30.080
<v Speaker 2>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

894
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of really a sort of primal </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

895
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.733
<v Speaker 2>And in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the goal was basically to make </v>

896
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:34.714
<v Speaker 2>me stop writing articles that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like and probably to decide with </v>

897
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 2>my wife that it was time to pack our </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags and leave Moscow.</v>

898
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Well because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

899
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:44.800
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my wife's brother cool and,</v>

900
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.703
<v Speaker 2>and independent and kind of feisty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she had her own life and she was </v>

901
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:49.504
<v Speaker 2>enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lucky in Russia you'd have to part </v>

902
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 2>with a sex manuals when it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

903
00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't open windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't quite as crudely phrase,</v>

904
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:57.071
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

905
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

906
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I was kind of furious.</v>

907
00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:01.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of thought,</v>

908
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:02.104
<v Speaker 2>well that's what they want me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so actually it didn't stop my </v>

909
00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 2>reporting in fact rather so sharpened </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

910
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.240
<v Speaker 2>But what it did do was to include it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reporting.</v>

911
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I could am I in the book I read off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got kicked out,</v>

912
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:14.520
<v Speaker 2>which was called Mafia state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

913
00:41:14.521 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 2>which I read from London.</v>

914
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I'd been bender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been expelled from that point,</v>

915
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.100
<v Speaker 2>but at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it did do was give me a kind of</v>

916
00:41:21.101 --> 00:41:21.934
<v Speaker 2>insight into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the thuggish newness to sort of </v>

917
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>crude nature of the KGB.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

918
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:27.904
<v Speaker 2>they're very keen to sort of show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are master that they kind of </v>

919
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.550
<v Speaker 2>control the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

920
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 2>they don't subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

921
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.043
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of target people messed at </v>

922
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:39.630
<v Speaker 2>random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

923
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contacts I made there that the way I</v>

924
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:43.694
<v Speaker 2>saw how kind of the Russian intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of know matrix works really helped </v>

925
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 2>with this book on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Donald Trump.</v>

926
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because,</v>

927
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump trump what he had slightly </v>

928
00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 2>different experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of,</v>

929
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I understand they're kind of dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>wellview actually.</v>

930
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we survived it.</v>

931
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's bloody terrifying now.</v>

932
00:42:04.511 --> 00:42:05.344
<v Speaker 2>So like sort of an aspect of Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian political strife that was </v>

933
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 2>presumably to some degree subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the KGB,</v>

934
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it's now been elevated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme potency in the figure of poo in.</v>

935
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.073
<v Speaker 2>So we should expect those tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of take place it on the </v>

936
00:42:20.681 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 2>national stage in the way they may have </v>
<v Speaker 2>only done covertly or domestically.</v>

937
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean essentially preaching for </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

938
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.713
<v Speaker 2>It's Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it again this time he's </v>

939
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.070
<v Speaker 2>determined to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of win.</v>

940
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

941
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:32.923
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

942
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 2>he sees Russia and opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

943
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 2>There's even a Russian word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which KGB,</v>

944
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a in all the KGB manuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called love me proteomic love.</v>

945
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.553
<v Speaker 2>And they put ethnic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which wins the main adversary gladney </v>

946
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 2>procurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

947
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.703
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really how Putin views views the </v>

948
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:50.624
<v Speaker 2>u s and we use the UK as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>little sidekick of the glove and the </v>

949
00:42:52.621 --> 00:42:54.210
<v Speaker 2>protein ethnic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

950
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.663
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing a pretty good job of </v>

951
00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 2>prevailing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

952
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 2>when a Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

953
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

954
00:43:01.301 --> 00:43:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you don't necessarily win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you want to do,</v>

955
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 2>you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to keep,</v>

956
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.900
<v Speaker 2>keep your enemy in a state of perpetual </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness and,</v>

957
00:43:07.901 --> 00:43:08.840
<v Speaker 2>and disarray.</v>

958
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're pretty good at that.</v>

959
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.913
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you said earlier that the sort of </v>

960
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.243
<v Speaker 2>American secret service community </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding this is a sort of an </v>

961
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:19.604
<v Speaker 2>inconceivable master stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's occurred that there sort of a </v>

962
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 2>spirit of chaos has been unleashed in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>American?</v>

963
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I W Bruton didn't do the unleashing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the chaos was there.</v>

964
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:30.370
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

965
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.730
<v Speaker 2>he just took advantage of it basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

966
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

967
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:35.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of quite crew,</v>

968
00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's quite effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

969
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:39.350
<v Speaker 2>he had gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got this troll factory,</v>

970
00:43:39.351 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 2>there's famous troll factory and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pittsburgh weather up there are gangs,</v>

971
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:44.390
<v Speaker 2>have sort of cynical students earning </v>
<v Speaker 2>$15,000</v>

972
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:45.224
<v Speaker 2>a year who posts comments in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in pretty good English on western </v>

973
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.180
<v Speaker 2>websites praising Putin or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

974
00:43:51.181 --> 00:43:52.014
<v Speaker 2>or adopting kind of talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it in the Guardian for years </v>

975
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:54.974
<v Speaker 2>and years and years.</v>

976
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.023
<v Speaker 2>And during the American election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Russian students called Sergei </v>

977
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:02.450
<v Speaker 2>were pretending to be text and </v>
<v Speaker 2>housewives called Karen,</v>

978
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing about,</v>

979
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting,</v>

980
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gifts of Donald Trump propping a Mexican</v>

981
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:10.700
<v Speaker 2>in the bin as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheerio Pal,</v>

982
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stirring up passions over immigration,</v>

983
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:15.410
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be activists from black </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives matter.</v>

984
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and loads and loads of Canada.</v>

985
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loads of other Americans were,</v>

986
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.790
<v Speaker 2>were gleefully re tweeting this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing it on their facebook pages,</v>

987
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.400
<v Speaker 2>liking it thinking I Look Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I like,</v>

988
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.253
<v Speaker 2>I agree with Karen and Karen is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sergei and say you don't need to be a </v>

989
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:36.564
<v Speaker 2>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just need to be a kind of </v>

990
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 2>opportunist and you need a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>

991
00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.460
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that even the sort of slightly</v>

992
00:44:43.461 --> 00:44:46.310
<v Speaker 1>comedic act of like</v>

993
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.483
<v Speaker 2>sp or would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that even work at the title </v>

994
00:44:49.091 --> 00:44:49.924
<v Speaker 2>espionage and sort of subterfuge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Subterfuge has an impact on the sort of </v>

995
00:44:54.551 --> 00:44:57.940
<v Speaker 2>feeling of being a marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It permits new permits,</v>

996
00:44:57.941 --> 00:44:58.774
<v Speaker 2>a different kind of discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying that is the war for </v>

997
00:45:00.341 --> 00:45:02.020
<v Speaker 2>the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of almost sort of,</v>

998
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:05.110
<v Speaker 2>it's shopping what's already in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and it's kind of an,</v>

999
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and actually if you kind of micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>

1000
00:45:06.761 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 2>if you look at swing states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have quite an influence.</v>

1001
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is that sort of a,</v>

1002
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's on facebook and facebook said</v>

1003
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:15.500
<v Speaker 2>initially know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1004
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians,</v>

1005
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.160
<v Speaker 2>what Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1006
00:45:19.161 --> 00:45:19.994
<v Speaker 2>And then something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came back to Congress two months ago </v>

1007
00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:21.651
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>

1008
00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:22.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1009
00:45:22.271 --> 00:45:25.940
<v Speaker 2>we've found all of these accounts paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>for in rubles from Moscow were,</v>

1010
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.193
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were actually pretending to be </v>

1011
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:31.630
<v Speaker 2>activists are pro trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really they were Russian systems.</v>

1012
00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:32.923
<v Speaker 1>Do you think then if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something is sort of broadly </v>

1013
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.560
<v Speaker 1>like something has comedic is that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be effective in the war for mental space</v>

1014
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.153
<v Speaker 1>then what we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we speculate as to what the impact </v>

1015
00:45:46.901 --> 00:45:49.210
<v Speaker 1>is of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the on going,</v>

1016
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want to,</v>

1017
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.880
<v Speaker 1>how do I want to turn this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of maintenance of the dominion</v>

1018
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.790
<v Speaker 1>of a sort of a capitalist consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1019
00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.120
<v Speaker 1>How we're continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how our thoughts are marshaled,</v>

1020
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.223
<v Speaker 1>controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we continually stimulated market it </v>

1021
00:46:05.321 --> 00:46:06.071
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:46:06.071 --> 00:46:06.904
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think of those as </v>

1023
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:12.400
<v Speaker 1>obviously an excellent and did diligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>story teller.</v>

1024
00:46:12.401 --> 00:46:14.650
<v Speaker 1>You're probably one of the best people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

1025
00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:15.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look from the justice for Tamir </v>

1026
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:18.040
<v Speaker 1>and your CV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would snow.</v>

1027
00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Then you've done in paradise papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done the collusion with Russia.</v>

1028
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1029
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1030
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:25.953
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these,</v>

1031
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.490
<v Speaker 1>this is an anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1032
00:46:27.491 --> 00:46:28.324
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems to me that just different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are getting a little go at </v>

1033
00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:33.270
<v Speaker 1>telling the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really only using this</v>

1034
00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.280
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1035
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.830
<v Speaker 1>they're using techniques that existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1036
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.700
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The there in a way to have aims and ends</v>

1037
00:46:40.701 --> 00:46:43.010
<v Speaker 1>that aren't that different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous,</v>

1038
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to say administrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like previous movements,</v>

1039
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.203
<v Speaker 1>previous movements in American life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So over the last 30 years of what's </v>

1040
00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.374
<v Speaker 1>happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably created this state of </v>

1041
00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:53.684
<v Speaker 1>disillusionment and disenfranchisement </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the mind can be sharpened to a </v>

1042
00:46:57.171 --> 00:47:00.980
<v Speaker 1>point of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about like that,</v>

1043
00:47:00.981 --> 00:47:01.814
<v Speaker 1>those kind of stories that are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>so pervasive that they are harder to </v>

1044
00:47:05.931 --> 00:47:07.040
<v Speaker 1>identify it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's,</v>

1045
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.370
<v Speaker 1>starts to sound a bit too wacky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiratorial?</v>

1046
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I feel like that's what's the </v>

1047
00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:15.800
<v Speaker 1>reason why I'm interested in Luke is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this [inaudible] my,</v>

1048
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my intuitive sense is that the,</v>

1049
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:20.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1050
00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.253
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oft made connection between Brexit </v>

1051
00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:24.554
<v Speaker 1>and trump is a reasonable one in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have swathes of people feeling a </v>

1052
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>sense of that they are lacking purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have had enough.</v>

1053
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:39.150
<v Speaker 1>And my fear and concern is that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosing the anomaly as the problem,</v>

1054
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.313
<v Speaker 1>we prevent people from analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing the proceeding conditions but </v>

1055
00:47:47.181 --> 00:47:48.014
<v Speaker 1>inevitably led towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why I'm fascinated by people point </v>

1056
00:47:50.851 --> 00:47:52.250
<v Speaker 1>it out like more</v>

1057
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:53.263
<v Speaker 2>covert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more insidious forms of tyranny such as </v>

1058
00:47:56.001 --> 00:47:59.360
<v Speaker 2>what proceeded trump interest me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do like,</v>

1059
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1060
00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1061
00:48:01.281 --> 00:48:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean I take your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1062
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:03.710
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1063
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I do think that these two things can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can both go on.</v>

1064
00:48:05.931 --> 00:48:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1065
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 2>the external conditions put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it color that they're produced.</v>

1066
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Brexit absolutely are real and they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily British.</v>

1067
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1068
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.970
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about them forever.</v>

1069
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 2>And there are people who are genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>disillusioned and have good reason to be</v>

1070
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:25.240
<v Speaker 2>kind of fed up with the system in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1071
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.433
<v Speaker 2>All of that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it's perfectly </v>

1072
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.040
<v Speaker 2>valid to see whether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1073
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Sergei and Saint Petersburg was also </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting up an account,</v>

1074
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting in favor of brexit because we </v>

1075
00:48:36.491 --> 00:48:37.324
<v Speaker 2>know that that is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were various kind of trolls </v>

1076
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.553
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be Brett's micro topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeting leave leaning voters during </v>

1077
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:46.150
<v Speaker 2>the run up to the election.</v>

1078
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.983
<v Speaker 2>And the pigeon is very delighted with </v>
<v Speaker 2>brexit because it weakens the European </v>

1079
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Union and it weakens the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1080
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.800
<v Speaker 2>and that that's all to his advantage as </v>
<v Speaker 2>he sees it.</v>

1081
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:55.903
<v Speaker 2>And they're also question marks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the money came from behind the </v>

1082
00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:59.060
<v Speaker 2>leave campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1083
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may all have been legitimate </v>

1084
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 2>donations from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1085
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.550
<v Speaker 2>from noble business people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1086
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.413
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has been routed through offshore and </v>

1087
00:49:08.161 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of terribly a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we can,</v>

1088
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.060
<v Speaker 2>we can diagnosed the social ills in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own country,</v>

1089
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.630
<v Speaker 2>but also be alert to the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>external manipulation,</v>

1090
00:49:17.631 --> 00:49:21.260
<v Speaker 2>whether it's from Russia or indeed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else because he's fascinating.</v>

1091
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is fascinating.</v>

1092
00:49:23.091 --> 00:49:23.671
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a,</v>

1093
00:49:23.671 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 2>it is a conundrum because if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we lose faith in democracy,</v>

1094
00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 2>if we lose faith in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1095
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in the possibility of a decent or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better society,</v>

1096
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 2>if we lose faith in each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1097
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:34.534
<v Speaker 2>where do we go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about Putin is that he is </v>

1098
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 2>a kind of supreme near list and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1099
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 2>he likes those conditions where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up believing in nothing because that</v>

1100
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:43.324
<v Speaker 2>suits his sort of agenda because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can do his sovereign thing without </v>

1101
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.970
<v Speaker 2>anyone calling him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1102
00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:50.270
<v Speaker 2>so I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1103
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do need to be even something,</v>

1104
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.420
<v Speaker 2>but we do need to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1105
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what's going on.</v>

1106
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.751
<v Speaker 1>Presumably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:49:56.751 --> 00:49:57.584
<v Speaker 1>having lived in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exposed as a sense that I'm actually </v>

1108
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:01.214
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1109
00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:03.680
<v Speaker 2>If there is going to be a geopolitical</v>

1110
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.970
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:05.803
<v Speaker 1>on the ultimate scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably would prefer things to be how </v>

1112
00:50:09.081 --> 00:50:11.300
<v Speaker 1>they are in Britain than Russia having </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived there.</v>

1113
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Those ration Porno mags.</v>

1114
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.443
<v Speaker 2>It was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a book on sex and </v>

1116
00:50:16.051 --> 00:50:19.470
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had quite leave it.</v>

1117
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.260
<v Speaker 2>They deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bookmarked help limb outage while</v>

1118
00:50:22.261 --> 00:50:25.260
<v Speaker 2>they hit it was bookmark to a page on </v>
<v Speaker 2>orgasms.</v>

1119
00:50:25.261 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So I think they were trying to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a while it was</v>

1120
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.993
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be both and I think I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know whether they were making a comment </v>

1121
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 1>about frequency or technique or all kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of inconsistency.</v>

1122
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

1123
00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.690
<v Speaker 1>But basically they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:50:38.691 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 1>we are watching you if they're well </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended,</v>

1125
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:45.851
<v Speaker 1>what if we re reposition Putin is a well</v>
<v Speaker 1>intending sort of avuncular figure there</v>

1126
00:50:47.201 --> 00:50:49.500
<v Speaker 1>simply to try to help you if your sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and American,</v>

1127
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:50.463
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should get him on your show </v>

1128
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and you can talk to him and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide.</v>

1129
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.283
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I certainly agree with you on </v>

1130
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:58.334
<v Speaker 1>luke is that we cannot afford to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted with the potential for </v>

1131
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:02.834
<v Speaker 1>democracy to be effective at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that in my own </v>

1132
00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:09.794
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I will happily admit is from </v>

1133
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 1>limited resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels to me that this despair is what</v>

1134
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:22.601
<v Speaker 1>has contributed to these dis junks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of sort of horrifying moments</v>

1135
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 1>if it culturally whatever side of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>divides you stand on.</v>

1136
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.303
<v Speaker 1>Even when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people of marching in Charlottesville </v>

1137
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.723
<v Speaker 1>when it's sort of outburst of rage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>low thing and sort of targeted at </v>

1138
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:38.680
<v Speaker 1>minority is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

1140
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 1>From what I sense is that the solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is to have an effective democracy and</v>

1142
00:51:50.231 --> 00:51:52.600
<v Speaker 1>my worry about something that's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1143
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.453
<v Speaker 1>an evident operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aberration operation such as trump such </v>

1144
00:51:57.131 --> 00:51:59.110
<v Speaker 1>as brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people</v>

1145
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.583
<v Speaker 2>won't</v>

1146
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:01.923
<v Speaker 1>look at what proceeded it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I feel that that's the platform </v>

1147
00:52:04.331 --> 00:52:06.040
<v Speaker 1>upon which these things rest</v>

1148
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.030
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're right,</v>

1149
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.430
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have to kind of keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>

1150
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:11.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without being too kind of platitude </v>

1151
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 2>in this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to kind of love each other,</v>

1152
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:16.770
<v Speaker 2>but we do have to kind of interrogate </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and,</v>

1153
00:52:16.771 --> 00:52:19.160
<v Speaker 2>and try and make sense of it and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>good stories.</v>

1154
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

1155
00:52:20.251 --> 00:52:21.084
<v Speaker 1>And you're certainly doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for the brilliant </v>

1156
00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:24.264
<v Speaker 1>work that you've done as a journalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a writer and bringing stories </v>

1157
00:52:27.151 --> 00:52:32.151
<v Speaker 1>that are complex and difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand to a wider audience that it's</v>

1158
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.520
<v Speaker 1>great work that we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's obviously taken a great deal of</v>

1159
00:52:35.521 --> 00:52:36.354
<v Speaker 1>bravery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly what you've undertaken in </v>

1160
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.210
<v Speaker 1>war conditions and under kind of level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of scrutiny in Russia.</v>

1161
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd enjoy that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out.</v>

1162
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 1>But just to say</v>

1163
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the really brave people in the story are</v>
<v Speaker 2>there not,</v>

1164
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:48.223
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not people like me with a foreign </v>

1165
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.400
<v Speaker 2>passport that the Russians or other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in,</v>

1166
00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.234
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in states where human rights are not so </v>

1167
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:56.380
<v Speaker 2>great because they pay a bigger price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very often they,</v>

1168
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.333
<v Speaker 2>they take take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the people I knew of </v>

1169
00:52:58.571 --> 00:52:59.404
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians have since been kind of </v>

1170
00:53:00.941 --> 00:53:02.410
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1171
00:53:02.411 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1172
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.310
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of think we should sort of solute</v>

1173
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:07.960
<v Speaker 2>people inside those countries who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to</v>

1174
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.343
<v Speaker 1>pastry to kind of change things for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better because they're tremendously </v>

1175
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:13.250
<v Speaker 1>pray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>been asked to read before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that not happening?</v>

1182
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.280
