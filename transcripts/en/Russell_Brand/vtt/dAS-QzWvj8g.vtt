00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>You are listening to under the skin with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell brand.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Today I'll be speaking to rupert </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheldrake.</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.643
<v Speaker 1>Rupert sheldrake is a biologist who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been called the most controversial </v>

4
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>scientist on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>his research strongly challenges the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigms of conventional science.</v>

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>And he's the author of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers and 10 science books,</v>

7
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>many of which have been best sellers </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide,</v>

8
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.504
<v Speaker 1>which developers hypotheses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional science has difficulty </v>

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as he's popular theory,</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>morphic resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lives in London with his wife,</v>

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Jill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have two sons.</v>

12
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.194
<v Speaker 1>He's latest book science and spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice is out now I'm holding a copy </v>

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>of it in my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at Rupert Sheldrake,</v>

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.574
<v Speaker 1>who's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been in the studio and matter of </v>

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.764
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've challenged the setup of the </v>

16
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>studio many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positioning of the microphone,</v>

17
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:51.504
<v Speaker 1>the positioning of the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that you are a man who </v>

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>continually flies in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention.</v>

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Have you always been like this rupert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>well not completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>but I have always heard her kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrarian streak,</v>

22
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How were your,</v>

23
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>was your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your early experience,</v>

24
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>your early professional life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional academia?</v>

25
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:12.661
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:13.494
<v Speaker 1>You were like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxford researcher or dawn dawn at </v>

27
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:16.944
<v Speaker 1>Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a phd at Cambridge knows that </v>

28
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Donna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

29
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I and a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose a conventional biologist.</v>

30
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.073
<v Speaker 1>Well I was doing unconventional sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the guise of a conventional </v>

31
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>academic appointment as a research </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow.</v>

32
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>

33
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>when I was at Cambridge I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how we could expand the frontiers of</v>

34
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>biology go beyond the framework of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>But at that stage I hadn't published </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity as on morphic resonance and what</v>

36
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I did was relatively within the limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of acceptable science.</v>

37
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting the Dogma and doctrine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it exists within the scientific and</v>

38
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.634
<v Speaker 1>academic communities and yours is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview that I feel that at the front </v>

39
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.054
<v Speaker 1>of obligated to say that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy is that I think that people </v>

40
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:08.991
<v Speaker 1>like on the sort of I posing side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument kind of regard you as like,</v>

41
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in spirituality.</v>

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you've already said about </v>

43
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>challenging frameworks is where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular academic interest lies.</v>

44
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I know there's much about convention </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've have to learn.</v>

45
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:24.504
<v Speaker 1>Of course I do like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very interested in pushing </v>

46
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>frontiers and boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there's some of the criticism,</v>

47
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.501
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

48
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.334
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're accused of is like </v>

49
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>pseudo science and stuff that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>backed up by proper evidence.</v>

50
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like that if we had neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson on,</v>

51
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and I hope we do one day or when I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had people I had on a sort of a,</v>

52
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of philosophy once from Oxford,</v>

53
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>he was like a Christian theologian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting,</v>

54
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.474
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you're dealing with </v>

55
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:49.644
<v Speaker 1>mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Christianity must be referred to </v>

56
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>as to a degree like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of,</v>

57
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy and there's hedge </v>
<v Speaker 1>money within those fields.</v>

58
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.594
<v Speaker 1>Why are you controversial?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it the have said that makes </v>

59
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>people think</v>

60
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 2>of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a phrase that I particularly </v>

61
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>hated them sometimes if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo Woo Frou Frou band Ted talk.</v>

62
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>You've got banned Ted talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that elite club,</v>

63
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>which I think is somewhat admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me like what your detractors say of</v>

64
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't mind?</v>

65
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first I have to say why they think it's </v>

66
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.050
<v Speaker 2>heretical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

67
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.353
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing fundamentally is </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging the materialist model of </v>

68
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:23.794
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds his based on has been for </v>

69
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.164
<v Speaker 2>more than a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the doctrine that all matters </v>

70
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:29.854
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole universe is made of </v>

71
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 2>unconscious matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

72
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>which then leaves the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come we are conscious?</v>

73
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.173
<v Speaker 2>And that's called the hard problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most scientists assume that </v>

74
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:41.314
<v Speaker 2>consciousness exists only in human </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains and possibly in animal brains to </v>

75
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.331
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

76
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.164
<v Speaker 2>the liberal ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe as far down as worms or </v>

77
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.894
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

78
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.771
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

79
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>it's all only in brains and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities unconscious,</v>

80
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>purposeless going nowhere.</v>

81
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Evolution is just a matter of blown </v>
<v Speaker 2>churns.</v>

82
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no god out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no spirit heart there.</v>

83
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no creativity out there is dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just chance.</v>

84
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.143
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that because they believe are </v>

85
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but our brains,</v>

86
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.033
<v Speaker 2>then anything that suggests the mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>extends further than the brain must be </v>

87
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>pseudo scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

88
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of research on </v>
<v Speaker 2>telepathy,</v>

89
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people,</v>

90
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.734
<v Speaker 2>and indeed dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a whole book on dog to and </v>

91
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 2>animal telepathy called dogs that know </v>
<v Speaker 2>when their owners are coming home.</v>

92
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on evidence that dogs can tell </v>

93
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.724
<v Speaker 2>when their owners are coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people have had this </v>

94
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done experiments and sure enough,</v>

95
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.463
<v Speaker 2>at least some dogs really can know when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people come at random times and </v>

96
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:50.791
<v Speaker 2>unfamiliar vehicles we film at All.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all this objective evidence.</v>

97
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.623
<v Speaker 2>But the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very fact that I'm suggesting to </v>

98
00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:56.114
<v Speaker 2>laugh with you might be real is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that provokes this kind of </v>

99
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.634
<v Speaker 2>hysterical response that it must be we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were pseudoscience because my opponents </v>

100
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 2>believe it's impossible.</v>

101
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 2>So they don't think they need to look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence.</v>

102
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:09.904
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore this stuff must be fake or </v>

103
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 2>phony or fraudulent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

104
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 2>and what I do is start from the position</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these things seem to happen.</v>

105
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:21.544
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people with dogs have notice</v>
<v Speaker 2>their dogs or cats pick up their </v>

106
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.024
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people who've had the </v>

107
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>experience of thinking of some who then </v>
<v Speaker 2>rings on the phone,</v>

108
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 2>telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telepathy.</v>

109
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 2>And I've done experiments to show it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not just chance.</v>

110
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

111
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the kinds of,</v>

112
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey cause you know like listen to me,</v>

113
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.074
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about God and consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing the world and a model that </v>

114
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.373
<v Speaker 2>expands beyond material is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where my particular </v>

115
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>fascination light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't they say that those,</v>

116
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 2>firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those examples about,</v>

117
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats and dogs,</v>

118
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:55.414
<v Speaker 2>they seem sort of somehow hum drum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day they seem anecdotal and w and </v>

119
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.214
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't they say members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream scientific community know </v>

120
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>we've done tests around that.</v>

121
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>It's down to random chance dogs don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know when their owners are coming home.</v>

122
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 2>We've can demonstrate this in scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory conditions,</v>

123
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.040
<v Speaker 2>double blind testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

124
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that what they would say?</v>

125
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

126
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>they don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

127
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out total.</v>

128
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 2>But what I searched there too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If lots of people,</v>

129
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.584
<v Speaker 2>I hope more than a thousand AU database,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got more than a thousand studies </v>

130
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.393
<v Speaker 2>your case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of dogs that do this and 600 </v>

131
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.353
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I would say the plural of anecdote </v>

132
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.664
<v Speaker 2>is data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If lots of people notice something then </v>

133
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.163
<v Speaker 2>to say this is rubbish because lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say or they've noticed it isn't </v>

134
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 2>the right starting point for science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's meant to be empirical,</v>

135
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>which means based on experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my response to this is to say,</v>

136
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's test it.</v>

137
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't that they'd done the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests and shown it didn't happen.</v>

138
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 2>No one had ever done a test before cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>they assume it's rubbish.</v>

139
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 2>So when I do the tests then with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>

140
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 2>then you involves filming the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place,</v>

141
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:05.384
<v Speaker 2>the dog weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having people come at random times come </v>

142
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.940
<v Speaker 2>in unfamiliar vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no possibility of the two.</v>

143
00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:12.774
<v Speaker 2>It's a routine response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't smell people from many miles </v>

144
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:16.754
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't identify the signed for </v>

145
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>unfamiliar taxi or other vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

146
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>and these dogs still do it and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>on film.</v>

147
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.103
<v Speaker 2>So I would say this is evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something which lots of people believe </v>

148
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that,</v>

149
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd concentrate a lot in a lot of my </v>

150
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 2>work on what I call the mysteries of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday life,</v>

151
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 2>what you call humdrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

152
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.763
<v Speaker 2>is precisely because these phenomena are</v>
<v Speaker 2>classified by most scientists as </v>

153
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 2>paranormal or para means beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that paranormal,</v>

154
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>which means they're sort of spooky or we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

155
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>my point is they're not paranormal at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

156
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Their normal everyday experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For most people.</v>

157
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 2>What's paranormal is the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things don't exist.</v>

158
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>A claim made without evidence on purely </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological grounds near the beginning.</v>

159
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:08.594
<v Speaker 2>Ribbit you said that that basic model of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream science is a materialistic </v>

160
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That material,</v>

161
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.023
<v Speaker 2>that Mata is not conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousnesses at some point in a way </v>

162
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>that we don't understand a merged from </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

163
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is the motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the defense of Dogma?</v>

164
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.723
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is rationalism and materialism so </v>

165
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 2>rigorously defended and alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>views?</v>

166
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so vehemently opposed?</v>

167
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of political.</v>

168
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Originally it was political in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

169
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.103
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>materialism was quite a small minority </v>

170
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>view within biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were fabulous.</v>

171
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>They thought there was a life force or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some life.</v>

172
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organisms weren't just machines.</v>

173
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the material is wanted to believe </v>

174
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>that because they wanted a universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just matter cause such a universe</v>

175
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 2>would have no god in it.</v>

176
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.383
<v Speaker 2>Why did they want that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because particularly in France where </v>

177
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>atheism got going in a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than an England,</v>

178
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.983
<v Speaker 2>the old regime that was overthrown in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the French revolution was very closely </v>

179
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>allied with the church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roman church.</v>

180
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>And they thought that to get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

181
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you got to get rid of Cha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the church too.</v>

182
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>And the best way to get rid of the power</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the church was to say,</v>

183
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 2>God doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole thing's ridiculous.</v>

184
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:41.241
<v Speaker 2>Sharman pretends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the French revolution in 1793 they</v>

185
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 2>abolished the Catholic Church in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They closed the monasteries,</v>

186
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.823
<v Speaker 2>they guillotines tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>priests and they proclaimed the cult of </v>

187
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.444
<v Speaker 2>reasons as the state religion notradame </v>
<v Speaker 2>cathedral was turned into a template of </v>

188
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:55.434
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in Russia where you had a similar </v>

189
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>massive growth of atheism in the late </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century.</v>

190
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>The Bolsheviks in whose revolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>account or missed a hundred years ago,</v>

191
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 2>1917,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

192
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.493
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get rid of religion because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought religion supported the SAR </v>

193
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the state,</v>

194
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and they wanted to destroy this </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious underpinning.</v>

195
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 2>So science was an ally for them in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>militant atheism.</v>

196
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.173
<v Speaker 2>And in Russia in the 19th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had about 5 million people belong </v>

197
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 2>to an organization called the League of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the militant godless.</v>

198
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.033
<v Speaker 2>That went round a bit like terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying bit like the League of the </v>

199
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>militant godless.</v>

200
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.583
<v Speaker 2>They went around and trying to stamp out</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to do with religion in </v>

201
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit like the red cards in China.</v>

202
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.600
<v Speaker 2>And so atheism was essentially political</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19th century.</v>

203
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.494
<v Speaker 2>And for much of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many people who are atheists wanted </v>

204
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 2>materialist science to back up their </v>
<v Speaker 2>views because it meant they could reject</v>

205
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 2>organized religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly Christianity,</v>

206
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in favor of other ideologies.</v>

207
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.243
<v Speaker 2>So it was a necessary tool in </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging hatch mini that religion at </v>

208
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:11.874
<v Speaker 2>the idea of God and man's relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with God was tied up in power </v>

209
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:15.594
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These power structures were corrupt and </v>

210
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 2>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to be overthrown.</v>

211
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean no one's saying the French </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution or the Russian revolution </v>

212
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 2>where bad things necessary but </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary revolutions,</v>

213
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 2>but in order to underwrite those </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions,</v>

214
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:29.904
<v Speaker 2>you had to attack the idea of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the main stay of the hedge </v>

215
00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>money or the sort of the basis of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

216
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.773
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier you mentioned this idea within </v>

217
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 2>biology of vitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in a,</v>

218
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.113
<v Speaker 2>in a a hundred years ago in biology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there was a sort of a </v>

219
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>super mechanical component and element </v>
<v Speaker 2>that couldn't be tracked was present.</v>

220
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:49.883
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning much about vedic philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they talk about the idea of </v>

221
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.394
<v Speaker 2>Brahman,</v>

222
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.263
<v Speaker 1>Prana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atma the idea that there are essential </v>

223
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>non-mechanical energies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is this,</v>

224
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 1>what is this connected to your idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphic resonance?</v>

225
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>How does it relate to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about,</v>

226
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by morphic residence?</v>

227
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by non mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy?</v>

228
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Even though it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that it was me.</v>

229
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphic resonance is the idea.</v>

230
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.440
<v Speaker 2>This a kind of memory in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see contemporary science,</v>

231
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:22.274
<v Speaker 2>one of the dogmas which was established </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 17th century at the scientific </v>

232
00:12:25.491 --> 00:12:29.390
<v Speaker 2>revolution is the idea that nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>governed by fixed laws.</v>

233
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.673
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was in the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is the maker and ruler of the </v>

234
00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:37.110
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God is eternal.</v>

235
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.950
<v Speaker 2>So God's laws are eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

236
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.843
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that everything in nature </v>

237
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:44.900
<v Speaker 2>has to follow these laws because God is </v>
<v Speaker 2>omnipotent.</v>

238
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:48.260
<v Speaker 2>So God was the universal law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 2>agency.</v>

239
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.240
<v Speaker 2>That was the metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

240
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

241
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a theological consumption and </v>

242
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the idea of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

243
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.843
<v Speaker 2>And it's very anthropocentric metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the universe that nature is </v>

244
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:04.070
<v Speaker 2>governed by laws and only humans have </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>

245
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you think about it,</v>

246
00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not a very appropriate metaphor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start with.</v>

247
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

248
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.133
<v Speaker 1>they were just patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like this idea of metaphor and </v>

249
00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:13.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

251
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.613
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we are necessarily dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with metaphor when we're dealing with </v>

252
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:20.340
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

253
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.020
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the mechanistic model was contrived</v>

254
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:25.973
<v Speaker 1>at a time when industry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanization was happening in human </v>

255
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:31.734
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would have been an attractive </v>

256
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>model and accessible model when </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanization was happening socially.</v>

257
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are a bit like a machine.</v>

258
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Nature's a bit like a machine that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the language.</v>

259
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:44.874
<v Speaker 1>It was in the ether here became </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate metaphor for </v>

260
00:13:46.681 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

261
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.980
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

262
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.113
<v Speaker 2>So he sort of nature as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanical system made off of </v>

263
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.570
<v Speaker 2>unconscious matter based on forces at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

264
00:13:56.571 --> 00:13:59.780
<v Speaker 2>by pushing and pulling at mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

265
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that the laws were fixed at</v>

266
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 2>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.653
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it made sense when they thought the </v>

268
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:08.144
<v Speaker 2>universe didn't basically change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the idea of evolution came </v>

269
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>along first in biology with Darwin in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1859,</v>

270
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 2>but then with the Big Bang Siri in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole of nature,</v>

271
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.363
<v Speaker 2>as late as 1966,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to radically evolutionary </v>

272
00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:25.370
<v Speaker 2>cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everything's evolving,</v>

273
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:26.563
<v Speaker 2>then why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laws of nature and in fact laws of </v>

274
00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:30.801
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

275
00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:33.950
<v Speaker 2>it isn't a very good metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Not Habits?</v>

276
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.263
<v Speaker 2>Why can't universe have regularities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are habits and then as it kind of </v>

277
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.283
<v Speaker 2>memory in nature that sustains them </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of some kind of external </v>

278
00:14:43.011 --> 00:14:48.011
<v Speaker 2>transcendent mind with fixed laws in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the eternal eternal God idea.</v>

279
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.763
<v Speaker 2>I've nothing against God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've got a lot of against the idea </v>

280
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:56.470
<v Speaker 2>of God making laws of nature that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally fixed.</v>

281
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.893
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the requirement for </v>

282
00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:03.150
<v Speaker 1>fixed laws is that a requirement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to conduct study.</v>

283
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.300
<v Speaker 1>If there are no fixed laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to conduct study,</v>

284
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.300
<v Speaker 1>so you need fixed laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be fixed laws,</v>

285
00:15:09.301 --> 00:15:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but in a way it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're moving through limit the space</v>

286
00:15:12.901 --> 00:15:16.770
<v Speaker 1>which is continually evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely that there are patterns</v>

287
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.633
<v Speaker 1>that seem like laws when observed from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular perspective but are going to </v>

288
00:15:21.781 --> 00:15:22.614
<v Speaker 1>be subject to the continual evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and change that all other phenomena </v>

289
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 1>appear to be subjective.</v>

290
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.573
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It puts it very well and you'll see </v>

291
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 2>things that have been going on a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

292
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.014
<v Speaker 2>like the crystallization of salt or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>formation of hydrogen atoms are such </v>

293
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 2>deep habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They behave as if they're changeless,</v>

294
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at new things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new forms of learning,</v>

295
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 2>new forms of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new chemical compounds,</v>

296
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.883
<v Speaker 2>then you see the habits build up and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence for morphic resonance comes </v>

297
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 2>from looking at new phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing new habits build up.</v>

298
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you crystallize a new compound,</v>

299
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 2>a new chemical compound for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

300
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it takes months or even years before </v>
<v Speaker 2>crystals form.</v>

301
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 2>But then once you've got it going all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world,</v>

302
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 2>they form more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you trained rats to learn a new trick</v>

303
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:11.804
<v Speaker 2>in London and rats all around the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn the same thing quicker according </v>

304
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:19.100
<v Speaker 2>to actual evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this disputed evidence,</v>

305
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 2>or is that stuff that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're down with that?</v>

306
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence was done years ago,</v>

307
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Harvard and in Edinburgh and Melbourne </v>
<v Speaker 2>university's,</v>

308
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.680
<v Speaker 2>no one's disputed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evidence,</v>

309
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:30.320
<v Speaker 2>the disputation is about how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret it.</v>

310
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 2>And most people thought at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

311
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>this just shows some weird effect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't fully understand,</v>

312
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 2>so let's forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

313
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I think the evidence for morphic </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonance,</v>

314
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of phenomenal already </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

315
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people agree about fit with morphic</v>

316
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.820
<v Speaker 2>resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

317
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Iq scores have gone up more than 30% </v>
<v Speaker 2>since Iq tests were invented in 1918 and</v>

318
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I predicted this would happen myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in 1918 obvious too,</v>

319
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Speaker 2>but in the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

320
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 2>because the tests have remained more or </v>
<v Speaker 2>less the same,</v>

321
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>millions of people have done them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people of salt,</v>

322
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:10.784
<v Speaker 2>these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be getting easier to do the </v>

323
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those calls would be going up.</v>

324
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:17.540
<v Speaker 2>The average scores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because people are getting smarter,</v>

325
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 2>there's no independent evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting smarter,</v>

326
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>but the scores are going up because so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have already done the tests.</v>

327
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.313
<v Speaker 1>I see is that there's a shared icloud of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that we're all uploading </v>

328
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:30.874
<v Speaker 1>our results into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we will have access to access to </v>

329
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.933
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is not wholly housed in </v>

330
00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:36.214
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but consciousness has some other </v>

331
00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:38.794
<v Speaker 1>component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one aspect of the theory of </v>

332
00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.530
<v Speaker 1>morphic resonance is it?</v>

333
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.513
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of collective memory and </v>

334
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.880
<v Speaker 2>that idea already existed in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist young.</v>

335
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.833
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his Jerry was the collective </v>

336
00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

337
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>had the idea that we all tap into a kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of collective memory,</v>

338
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.053
<v Speaker 2>but he was thinking just in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human psychology and I'm saying that's </v>

339
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>the way that all nature works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just us.</v>

340
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.223
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saying because of patterns in dreams </v>

341
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.623
<v Speaker 1>that people dream in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent language in set and Casey's </v>

342
00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:12.914
<v Speaker 1>that motifs appear across cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across continents that have a continuum </v>

343
00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:18.224
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell's working comparative </v>

344
00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:20.564
<v Speaker 1>mythology suggest that indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures produce patterns within their </v>

345
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:27.880
<v Speaker 1>myths that are identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the s,</v>

346
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an African myth or an Icelandic myth can</v>

347
00:18:31.101 --> 00:18:31.934
<v Speaker 1>have templates that are comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which suggest that consciousness </v>

348
00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.850
<v Speaker 1>communicates or at least has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential quality.</v>

349
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.570
<v Speaker 1>There is not determined by material </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality or geography,</v>

350
00:18:41.571 --> 00:18:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but has some other form of connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

351
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I personally don't have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea because I see that the sensory</v>

352
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:52.430
<v Speaker 1>realm is accessible by the instruments </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

353
00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.264
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't have a sense of smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to understand </v>

354
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 1>conceptually what you meant by a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of smell.</v>

355
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I know that different animals have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ranges of hearing,</v>

356
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.083
<v Speaker 1>have different ranges of sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me possible that energy </v>

357
00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:05.714
<v Speaker 1>can communicate and travel in means too </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle for my limited instruments to </v>

358
00:19:11.091 --> 00:19:13.430
<v Speaker 1>ascertain and receive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

359
00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:14.264
<v Speaker 1>it's never been a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is necessarily difficult to </v>

360
00:19:17.301 --> 00:19:18.134
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate when it's transferred back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the language of mechanics material </v>

361
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.620
<v Speaker 1>and identifiable evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

362
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

363
00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:27.340
<v Speaker 2>not in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

364
00:19:27.341 --> 00:19:30.760
<v Speaker 2>you can do experiments to test this on </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals,</v>

365
00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:32.680
<v Speaker 2>on crystals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on ranch,</v>

366
00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:36.460
<v Speaker 2>on humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in principle you can test us with the</v>

367
00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:37.630
<v Speaker 2>scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

368
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally pro the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend a lot of my life doing </v>

369
00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:42.700
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

370
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

371
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.980
<v Speaker 2>in principle there's no reason you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>test it.</v>

372
00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:50.540
<v Speaker 2>And in fact it has been tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

373
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just an unfamiliar idea for most </v>
<v Speaker 2>Westerners.</v>

374
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Now you're studying eastern philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eastern philosophy.</v>

375
00:19:58.091 --> 00:20:00.910
<v Speaker 2>The idea of a memory in nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely standard.</v>

376
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I lived in India for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in an agricultural institute.</v>

378
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

379
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.830
<v Speaker 2>so I sort of got fairly familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian philosophy.</v>

380
00:20:11.831 --> 00:20:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I was in much influenced by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this idea before I went,</v>

381
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.623
<v Speaker 2>but when I talked about this idea in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambridge on high table of my college </v>

382
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.833
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

383
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the looks of blanking comprehension or </v>

384
00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:26.650
<v Speaker 2>in the tea room of the Biochemistry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Department where I worked,</v>

385
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got to India I would explain this</v>

386
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:32.890
<v Speaker 2>idea to Indian friends and colleagues.</v>

387
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Even people I met on trains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you sound test.</v>

388
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they do.</v>

389
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked me first,</v>

390
00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:42.670
<v Speaker 2>in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you sit on the train,</v>

392
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your name?</v>

393
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.563
<v Speaker 2>Where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ecentra and then give me some of your </v>

394
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

395
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 2>about three questions in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

396
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your salary?</v>

397
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>They ask you what is your view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

398
00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.893
<v Speaker 2>So I really wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I explained this and the general </v>

399
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 2>response I got from Indian friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colleagues,</v>

400
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 2>and even strangers with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing new in this idea.</v>

401
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Ancient Rishis have said there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago.</v>

402
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

403
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:14.250
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that vedic?</v>

404
00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 2>We understood the idea that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this a memory in nature,</v>

405
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of Karma,</v>

406
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.423
<v Speaker 2>which in in it's limited form is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reincarnation carrying over memories </v>

407
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>from one life to another.</v>

408
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.460
<v Speaker 2>But in it's more general form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

409
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>can be seen as a theory of cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

410
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And in some forms of Buddhist and Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

411
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.783
<v Speaker 2>they have this idea of a cosmic memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sea Asopus took this up with our </v>

412
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 2>idea of the akashic records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a kind of cosmic memory bank.</v>

413
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know all that.</v>

414
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 2>When I thought of these ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambridge,</v>

415
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I came to them through thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology and plants and you know,</v>

416
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:55.984
<v Speaker 2>it was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you come to when I was working </v>

417
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 2>on plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do plants grow?</v>

418
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Plant morphogenesis the development of </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

419
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does the leaf become a leaf?</v>

420
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 2>How does a rose fly become a rose </v>
<v Speaker 2>flower?</v>

421
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Why is an oak leaf different from an ash</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaf?</v>

422
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked hard.</v>

423
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.123
<v Speaker 2>I was working on the plant and hormone </v>
<v Speaker 2>auxins supplant a hormone that makes </v>

424
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 2>cells grow and makes roots form and </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes would cells form.</v>

425
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 2>And I worked hard at how it was made and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it was transported run the plant.</v>

426
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.713
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is it's transported round </v>
<v Speaker 2>to all plants in the similar way and </v>

427
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:32.404
<v Speaker 2>it's made in a similar way in all plants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet they have different shapes and </v>

428
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.334
<v Speaker 2>so everyone was trying to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can explain form in terms of </v>

429
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:40.690
<v Speaker 2>chemicals and this was the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical.</v>

430
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Everyone thought was the important </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence,</v>

431
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but I realized actually it won't explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

432
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:47.194
<v Speaker 2>They've all got the same one is and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trying to explain what goes on in </v>

433
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.124
<v Speaker 2>different shops and factories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools because they will have the same </v>

434
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you an end to it?</v>

435
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:55.910
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

436
00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

437
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Take it away in the system would </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse,</v>

438
00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't explain why they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>different or why they have that form.</v>

439
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.703
<v Speaker 2>And an idea that came up in the 1920s in</v>
<v Speaker 2>developmental biology was the idea of </v>

440
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>morphogenetic fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fields that shape form.</v>

441
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I got interested in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I realized these fields have to</v>

442
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:19.804
<v Speaker 2>be inherited somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be inherited through genes </v>

443
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 2>were changing code for proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to be inherited by some kind of</v>

444
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 2>direct link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I run out,</v>

445
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.880
<v Speaker 2>asked if it was a kind of memory across </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

446
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 2>a great deal of biology would make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

447
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Not just biology but a lot of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had this kind of flash of insight </v>

448
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:40.234
<v Speaker 2>and for three or four days I was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>manic state when I first came up with </v>

449
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 2>the idea of morphic resonance because </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more things made sense.</v>

450
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I got worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:23:48.331 --> 00:23:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of theory of everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I ought to be worried about there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't publish it for another eight</v>

453
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I've really got to think about</v>

454
00:23:57.081 --> 00:24:02.081
<v Speaker 2>this hard and look at the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I finally worked through a long</v>

455
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it made,</v>

456
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.470
<v Speaker 2>it really did make sense after thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it through.</v>

457
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I published my first </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

458
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.800
<v Speaker 2>a new science of life.</v>

459
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.733
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that there is a memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is beyond material that is </v>

460
00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:18.450
<v Speaker 1>traveling through time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you give us some examples of that?</v>

461
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one example would be the,</v>

462
00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:22.264
<v Speaker 2>the thing I mentioned with rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If animals learn a new trick then ranch </v>

463
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:27.424
<v Speaker 2>similar rats faced with the same trick </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else on the basis of </v>

464
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:31.624
<v Speaker 2>similarity resonate with those rats </v>
<v Speaker 2>before morphic resonance is about </v>

465
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.770
<v Speaker 2>similarity in patterns of vibration or </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of activity.</v>

466
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so um,</v>

467
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:46.500
<v Speaker 2>what I'm suggesting is there's a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonance across time that um,</v>

468
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.403
<v Speaker 2>just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ma goes across time without falling off </v>

469
00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:55.021
<v Speaker 2>with time and across space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a difficult idea perhaps,</v>

470
00:24:56.051 --> 00:24:56.884
<v Speaker 2>but the alternative is laws of nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are outside of time and space </v>

471
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:02.860
<v Speaker 2>altogether and yet somehow present </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

472
00:25:02.861 --> 00:25:07.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if the conventional </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative is absolutely mind boggling.</v>

473
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 2>My mind bottle factor free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just we're used to it.</v>

474
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.630
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're quite right that to suggest there</v>

475
00:25:12.631 --> 00:25:13.464
<v Speaker 1>are objective laws that exist outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that is an unusual and as you've </v>

476
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.990
<v Speaker 1>said already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

477
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it's analogist to the idea of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

478
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there is an absolute template,</v>

479
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.060
<v Speaker 1>a sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

480
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.080
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a monolith of truth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands beyond the,</v>

481
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.470
<v Speaker 1>that's in a sense as a paradigm that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as saying,</v>

482
00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:36.930
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these rules that are in charge</v>

483
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.903
<v Speaker 2>except for material is scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rules are supposed to have come </v>

484
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:41.054
<v Speaker 2>about spontaneously by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like things in a mind but they </v>

485
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:46.154
<v Speaker 2>say there is no mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're completely paradoxical to </v>

486
00:25:48.911 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 2>have laws that are in material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are rational,</v>

487
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.873
<v Speaker 2>that have no material being and yet no </v>
<v Speaker 2>non material substrate is incoherent </v>

488
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:00.974
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet that's what most scientists </v>

489
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

490
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:03.603
<v Speaker 1>How and why it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what more of obvious example I </v>

491
00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:08.014
<v Speaker 1>for obvious that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that famous example of the four minute </v>

492
00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:10.384
<v Speaker 1>mile as in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chariots of fire though no one could </v>

493
00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:15.190
<v Speaker 1>break the four minute mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone breaks the four minute mile,</v>

494
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.083
<v Speaker 1>then people break the four minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's took a very poor public </v>

495
00:26:18.011 --> 00:26:18.844
<v Speaker 1>identifiable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The once he's identified that something </v>

496
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:23.320
<v Speaker 1>is achievable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes achievable.</v>

497
00:26:23.321 --> 00:26:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It comes sanctioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible.</v>

498
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm interested in rupert,</v>

499
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.733
<v Speaker 1>ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dogma behaves and how heresy is </v>

500
00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 1>regarded in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things I enjoyed in your,</v>

501
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.840
<v Speaker 1>let's call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

502
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

503
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Ted talk is a cool thing.</v>

504
00:26:42.281 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I think like in your band</v>

505
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 2>a Ted talk is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

506
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.440
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream science protects it,</v>

507
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmas through denial of variation.</v>

508
00:26:56.911 --> 00:26:58.370
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

509
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed of light?</v>

510
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

511
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I gave an example of the speed of light </v>
<v Speaker 2>that between,</v>

512
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I got interested in this because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that the speed of light,</v>

513
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:09.954
<v Speaker 2>it's totally constant and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constants are constant as part of the </v>

514
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:14.720
<v Speaker 2>fixed law dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

515
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 2>so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

516
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll just check out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no particular,</v>

517
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:20.724
<v Speaker 2>I don't work on physical constants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't a particular thing where I </v>

518
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 2>had a personal interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just thought I'd look at the data.</v>

519
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:28.104
<v Speaker 2>And when I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed to find it varied quite a </v>

520
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:31.374
<v Speaker 2>lot between 1928 in 1950 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed of light dropped by 20 </v>

521
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 2>kilometers per second or around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

522
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And then it went up again and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>all claiming that they're accurate.</v>

523
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.000
<v Speaker 2>They have little error bars on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>graph.</v>

524
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:50.001
<v Speaker 2>So you showing very small arrows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arrow was like plus or minus 0.1</v>

525
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:54.090
<v Speaker 2>of a kilometer per second and yet lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 kilometers per second difference.</v>

526
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 2>And I just couldn't understand what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

527
00:27:58.591 --> 00:27:59.424
<v Speaker 2>So I went to see the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national physics laboratory at </v>

528
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Teddington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

529
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 2>the man in charge of measuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>constance.</v>

530
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Speaker 2>And I asked him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

531
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it was constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't even need him,</v>

532
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.130
<v Speaker 2>your laptop mate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always the same.</v>

533
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.950
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

534
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

535
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a very embarrassing incident</v>

536
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 2>in the history of our science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

537
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that everyone was fudging</v>

538
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:31.520
<v Speaker 2>their results?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>

539
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:32.354
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

540
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.263
<v Speaker 2>during the whole of that period or </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world to get the expected </v>

541
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:36.750
<v Speaker 2>result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

542
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 2>we don't like to use the word fudging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

543
00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.241
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

544
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

545
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>we prefer to call it intellectual phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locking certainly rate.</v>

546
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.353
<v Speaker 2>They then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it went up again and then they to </v>

547
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 2>resolve this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just defined it.</v>

548
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.410
<v Speaker 2>They by fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they invented the speed of light,</v>

549
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 2>the closest value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

550
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 2>that's it from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's defined.</v>

551
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.450
<v Speaker 2>And then they defined the meter in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the speed of light.</v>

552
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that even if the speed of light did </v>

553
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:04.554
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd never notice because the media </v>

554
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 2>would change in length.</v>

555
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 2>The same time in the unit of measurement</v>
<v Speaker 2>would also alter,</v>

556
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm reminded of the Melville quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all human science,</v>

557
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:16.014
<v Speaker 2>but passing fables as we learn more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that we think of as being </v>

558
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.043
<v Speaker 2>absolute will necessarily evolve because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are only looking at a small portion </v>

559
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.080
<v Speaker 2>of all of the available evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do,</v>

560
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.973
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revelations in quantum physics in your </v>

561
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean about the nature of consciousness?</v>

562
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I know that they're double slit theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an area that,</v>

563
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like myself who are of a </v>

564
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 2>spiritual bent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

565
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Lee Paul over as evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness impact,</v>

566
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.613
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mattel matter and the behavior of waves </v>

567
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and particles and physicists say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

568
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:56.111
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

569
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:59.830
<v Speaker 2>you're misinterpreting this in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing conclusions that are erroneous,</v>

570
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>but what does it tell us without us </v>
<v Speaker 2>being too sort of quick to leap on our,</v>

571
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:05.711
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

572
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:06.544
<v Speaker 2>our chariots of fire and start blasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the silver trump pits and </v>

573
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>proclaiming the lord?</v>

574
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the main,</v>

575
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.473
<v Speaker 2>most important thing about quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory is it tells us that nature is </v>

576
00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:18.860
<v Speaker 2>probabilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

577
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.840
<v Speaker 2>there's no rigid determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't predict things exactly.</v>

578
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a kind of inherent freedom,</v>

579
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even at the most fundamental put in the </v>

580
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 2>most fundamental particles of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the staff freedom.</v>

581
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.643
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean that just because the </v>

582
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:38.914
<v Speaker 2>behavior of particles and waves </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently altering under observational </v>

583
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and under observation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

584
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:44.180
<v Speaker 2>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

585
00:30:44.181 --> 00:30:48.970
<v Speaker 2>if you measure the take a single photon </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through a double slit for example,</v>

586
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.073
<v Speaker 2>you can't predict which way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas lend up which bit of the film </v>

587
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that you're filming it with it'll land </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

588
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 2>But if you send thousands of single </v>
<v Speaker 2>photons,</v>

589
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 2>one after another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a kind of average pattern,</v>

590
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 2>which is like a wave pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

591
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 2>so it follows a kind of probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

592
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 2>but you can't predict any individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

593
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a radioactive uranium </v>
<v Speaker 2>atom,</v>

594
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say what it's halflife is.</v>

595
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.153
<v Speaker 2>We've got millions of them by how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>years will it be before half of them </v>

596
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:21.850
<v Speaker 2>have decayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this individual atom,</v>

597
00:31:21.851 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell if it's going to decay in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million years or in the next second.</v>

598
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.030
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that enables you to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

599
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's an inherent freedom at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very foundation of matter.</v>

600
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.383
<v Speaker 2>And what chaos theory has shown is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even bigger things like the weather </v>

601
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 2>systems have a kind of inherent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism or freedom.</v>

602
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And the same is true of the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerve cells in our brain work.</v>

603
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 2>And many of them are on a knife edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could go one way or another.</v>

604
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So all through natures as this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>in determinism.</v>

605
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means there's a kind of inherent </v>

606
00:31:55.271 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>freedom at all levels in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain strong habits,</v>

607
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 2>but when you get things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing and they're on cusp points,</v>

608
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this kind of in determinism.</v>

609
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't think the observer stuff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum theory,</v>

610
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it's overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

611
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consciousness thing.</v>

612
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.133
<v Speaker 2>Well basically what it says is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of observation you make in quantum </v>

613
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>theory depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you're observing.</v>

614
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.473
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your observations depends on the </v>

615
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Observer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the philosopher Schopenhauer pointed</v>

616
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 2>out exactly that in around 1800 you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole of science.</v>

617
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 2>He said all observations depend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>observers.</v>

618
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as if nature is out there,</v>

619
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 2>just sort of passively observing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we observe nature,</v>

620
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 2>we come to it with our frameworks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

621
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 2>preconceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring apparatus at Centra.</v>

622
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Whenever we ask a question of nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an experiment,</v>

623
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 2>the answer we get depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question we make.</v>

624
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So that's a perfectly general point </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all science.</v>

625
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 2>It only came to sort of pump pillar </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness through quantum theory,</v>

626
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's not specific to quantum theory.</v>

627
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

628
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you think on a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical level,</v>

629
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 1>the imposition of dogma normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>protects the interests of the powerful.</v>

630
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Is it important that much of what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as a sanctioned and valorized </v>

631
00:33:17.821 --> 00:33:19.960
<v Speaker 1>science is corporately funded?</v>

632
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's important.</v>

633
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the most important thing sake.</v>

634
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.373
<v Speaker 2>The dog moves of science got established</v>
<v Speaker 2>before corporate funding became very </v>

635
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:31.604
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this dogmatic materialism was </v>

636
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>already well established by the late </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century when,</v>

637
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you know there are a few German </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies making aniline dyes and things</v>

638
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.083
<v Speaker 2>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early chemical companies making aspirin </v>

639
00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:45.344
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But long before this sort of massive </v>

640
00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 2>corporate involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an ideological movement.</v>

641
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:53.740
<v Speaker 2>People like th Huxley here in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

642
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.443
<v Speaker 2>we're basic material and that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to spread the message about </v>

643
00:33:58.611 --> 00:33:59.444
<v Speaker 2>materialism cause they wanted to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of religion and make </v>

644
00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 2>scientists as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new priesthood.</v>

645
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:06.463
<v Speaker 2>If you have a culture where you destroy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old priesthood and where science </v>

646
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>reasoning and progress of your ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and every government now being converted</v>

647
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:15.044
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic progress through science and </v>

648
00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every government in the world,</v>

649
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:24.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a dominant paradigm then who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the priests of this new culture?</v>

650
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.873
<v Speaker 2>Obviously as a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Th Huxley wanted the scientist to </v>

651
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 2>become a kind of priestly caste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.520
<v Speaker 2>professional scientists who would then </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the go to people for governments.</v>

653
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 2>And in many countries there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>separation between church and state.</v>

654
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 2>But in no country is the separation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between science and state.</v>

655
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 2>So I would say the power base of science</v>
<v Speaker 2>is much more state than,</v>

656
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 2>than corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've come long later.</v>

657
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.280
<v Speaker 2>What is their gospel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

658
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.123
<v Speaker 2>the Gospel is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we'll save the world through science </v>

659
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

660
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:01.470
<v Speaker 2>where the saviors of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

661
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Speaker 2>religions have screwed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just fight each other.</v>

662
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.610
<v Speaker 2>But we come along and we'll care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diseases,</v>

663
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:11.870
<v Speaker 2>reduce infant mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide abundant consumer goods,</v>

664
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prolong life.</v>

665
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 2>And many of these promises of come true </v>
<v Speaker 2>after all.</v>

666
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:19.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not just ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very powerful,</v>

667
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>much less what is not empirical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

668
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:24.434
<v Speaker 2>it's not imperia clears the metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief system that nature's totally </v>

669
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's all unconscious,</v>

670
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 2>that the laws are fixed.</v>

671
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.100
<v Speaker 2>All these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my book,</v>

672
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.470
<v Speaker 2>the science to illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have these 10 dog,</v>

673
00:35:35.471 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 2>most of science memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stored in the brain.</v>

674
00:35:38.281 --> 00:35:39.820
<v Speaker 2>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

675
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.690
<v Speaker 2>they believe that because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialist,</v>

676
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.553
<v Speaker 2>everything must be matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all our memories must be inside our </v>

677
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 2>heads in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A memory must have a material component.</v>

678
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It must on some level be measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

679
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 2>And therefore when you die and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain decays,</v>

680
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.313
<v Speaker 2>all your memories were wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every religion that believes in </v>

681
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 2>reincarnation or an afterlife or </v>
<v Speaker 2>purgatory or whatever,</v>

682
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 2>any form of transmigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any form of transmigration,</v>

683
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:12.711
<v Speaker 2>any kind of access to connections or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that must be rubbish.</v>

684
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:13.914
<v Speaker 2>Because memories in the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible for any aspect of them to </v>

685
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:17.754
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me the rational conclusion </v>

686
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.260
<v Speaker 2>of rationalism is that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

687
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Speaker 2>There is no meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore consume.</v>

688
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.103
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the word materialism has </v>

689
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 2>two meanings.</v>

690
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And in science and philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means this worldview I'd been talking</v>

691
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 2>about and we've been discussing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary everyday language.</v>

692
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:39.204
<v Speaker 2>It means people who go to shopping malls</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and are constantly </v>

693
00:36:41.521 --> 00:36:42.354
<v Speaker 2>consuming things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That connection is telling that and you </v>

694
00:36:44.251 --> 00:36:44.821
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

695
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:45.654
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

696
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.910
<v Speaker 2>very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's not a coincidence.</v>

697
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 2>We used the same word for both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we talk a bit about psychedelics and</v>

698
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you taking psychedelics?</v>

699
00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk too much about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>since most of them are still illegal,</v>

700
00:36:58.891 --> 00:36:59.724
<v Speaker 2>but should we talk about how you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>never taken psychedelics now it's </v>

701
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.680
<v Speaker 2>illegal and wrong today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why.</v>

702
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.514
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in Terence Mckenna </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were friends with Terence </v>

703
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.541
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

704
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I've heard him talk about you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

705
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 2>We were great friends and in fact we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>with our friend Ralph Abraham,</v>

706
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 2>who's a chaos theory mathematician at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the University of California.</v>

707
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.513
<v Speaker 2>We had about 40 or 53 way trial logs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we produced two books together and it </v>

708
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>was about 20 or 30 of these try logs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my website in streaming audio.</v>

709
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.003
<v Speaker 2>for 20 years nearly we met every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spent several days just talking to </v>

711
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>each other cause that's what we most </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy doing.</v>

712
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:42.894
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we were interested in </v>

713
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 2>was indeed psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one is terrance had many interests.</v>

714
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics is what he's best known </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

715
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:52.194
<v Speaker 2>But he had an extraordinarily wide </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranging mind and he was also incredibly </v>

716
00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.680
<v Speaker 2>well for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

718
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.713
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose if it's a long time ago and </v>

719
00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:03.714
<v Speaker 2>talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me a great revelation was in about </v>

720
00:38:06.061 --> 00:38:11.061
<v Speaker 2>1971 when I took lsd for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

721
00:38:12.701 --> 00:38:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I had been taught about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

722
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied this stuff.</v>

723
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 2>It Cambridge as an undergraduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.600
<v Speaker 2>nerve impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters,</v>

725
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.260
<v Speaker 2>hormones affecting sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual characteristics,</v>

726
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:26.094
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly and the immediacy and the </v>

727
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 2>incredible power of this visionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

728
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.993
<v Speaker 2>I just felt something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important to just be left out from </v>

729
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:36.454
<v Speaker 2>this world view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it really was what the term </v>

730
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic means psyche,</v>

731
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>revealing mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revealing.</v>

732
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:47.791
<v Speaker 2>It revealed a Roho realms of mine that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no experience before noon at told me</v>

733
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

734
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.210
<v Speaker 2>and opened up an interest in the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of consciousness.</v>

735
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a transformative experience.</v>

736
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.593
<v Speaker 2>Do you experienced during this period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago that was so </v>

737
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 2>transformative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Describe it please.</v>

738
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happened was I took</v>

739
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it with a French annotating it once or </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice before.</v>

740
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 2>We thought it took an hour to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he thought.</v>

741
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.060
<v Speaker 2>So we took it</v>

742
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.200
<v Speaker 1>to wrap the site that we can hear police</v>
<v Speaker 1>sirens.</v>

743
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:19.883
<v Speaker 2>So we took it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we thought we'd have a meal while we </v>

744
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.373
<v Speaker 2>came on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were in a restaurant and it came </v>

745
00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:24.930
<v Speaker 2>on during the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this restaurant,</v>

746
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:27.390
<v Speaker 2>food started looking distorted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole theme.</v>

747
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want you to get back to my rooms in</v>

748
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:30.894
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a of cloud college at the time </v>

749
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.580
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that suddenly this journey became a kind</v>

750
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:36.900
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went on forever,</v>

751
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 2>going through streets and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>distorted.</v>

752
00:39:39.901 --> 00:39:40.734
<v Speaker 2>And when I got back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I must have taken a massive </v>

753
00:39:42.661 --> 00:39:44.220
<v Speaker 2>area of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

754
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.780
<v Speaker 2>cause I felt completely out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole ego was dissolved.</v>

755
00:39:48.781 --> 00:39:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had come on sooner than we thought.</v>

756
00:39:53.011 --> 00:39:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So I thought this must be a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>overdose.</v>

757
00:39:54.871 --> 00:39:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll be insane forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

758
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.100
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I must be in hell.</v>

759
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>And then neon signs saying hell that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've all around me,</v>

760
00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:03.210
<v Speaker 2>which proved it.</v>

761
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a friend,</v>

762
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.383
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend sort of talk to me and I sort </v>

763
00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 2>of came to my senses as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not really a census,</v>

764
00:40:11.071 --> 00:40:16.071
<v Speaker 2>but suddenly I felt so if I was floating</v>
<v Speaker 2>up towards,</v>

765
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I saw the light above me and I broke </v>
<v Speaker 2>through like the surface of the ocean.</v>

766
00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:22.260
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly I was in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent beauty.</v>

767
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music turned into forms and patterns.</v>

768
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I had the sense of connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one at all and everything.</v>

769
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:31.950
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

770
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.113
<v Speaker 2>kind of mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I later came to know that Stan grof </v>

771
00:40:37.081 --> 00:40:37.914
<v Speaker 2>and other people describe this as a kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of death and rebirth experience like </v>

772
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.280
<v Speaker 2>that going up through the darkness to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the light.</v>

773
00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:45.114
<v Speaker 2>It's like being born from the wound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out through the birth canal into </v>

774
00:40:48.691 --> 00:40:49.524
<v Speaker 2>the lighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a birth or rebirth </v>

775
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:52.854
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was a kind of </v>

776
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:55.404
<v Speaker 2>transformative moment of a whole new way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of understanding consciousness and my </v>

777
00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:03.120
<v Speaker 2>connection with the greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

778
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.163
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very idea that one's conscious </v>

779
00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 2>experience can be chemically altered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's perceptions are not um,</v>

780
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.610
<v Speaker 1>rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>

781
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:13.973
<v Speaker 1>It demonstrates the plasticity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and our relationship with </v>

782
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna,</v>

783
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:22.803
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that fascinates me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Kim is the conclusions he draws </v>

784
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 1>from these experiences with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that power operates,</v>

785
00:41:30.101 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>the control of substances of this nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>in me as a person that's in from drugs.</v>

786
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:35.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take drugs.</v>

787
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking drugs for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I,</v>

788
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.823
<v Speaker 1>what I personally in chew it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there real so many vested interests in </v>

789
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:46.394
<v Speaker 1>keeping people behaving in an orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner and if you have access to </v>

790
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:52.334
<v Speaker 1>mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it one tends towards challenging </v>

791
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 1>structures and like we said at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of our interview,</v>

792
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Rupert looking at frameworks and asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply why,</v>

793
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>why does my life have to exist within </v>
<v Speaker 1>this framework?</v>

794
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Why must I behave in this way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this convention being observed?</v>

795
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting.</v>

796
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.913
<v Speaker 1>I know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said about revolutions earlier </v>

797
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:15.344
<v Speaker 1>and the necessity for to challenge the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of God because of the way that God </v>

798
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:19.964
<v Speaker 1>was operating in power structures prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the two revolutions that you </v>

799
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 1>mentioned you use to underwrite those </v>
<v Speaker 1>power structures.</v>

800
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I can see the necessity for challenging </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge money in that form,</v>

801
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but the removal of God to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor the full niche and quote you,</v>

802
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.263
<v Speaker 1>the God is dead and we have killed him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's not enough water in the </v>

803
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:41.930
<v Speaker 1>world to watch the blood from our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that when we lose God,</v>

804
00:42:41.931 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 1>when we lose a way of accessing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the mystery,</v>

805
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.173
<v Speaker 1>we prevent ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have prohibited from being fully </v>

806
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually evolving and connected.</v>

807
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:54.764
<v Speaker 1>We begin to regard ourselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material model as components that have </v>

808
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 1>to have a mechanical function to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

809
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.280
<v Speaker 1>We become a tool of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We become either an asset or a deficit.</v>

810
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.653
<v Speaker 1>We don't have inherent value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can see the politically why these </v>

811
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>power structures are perpetuating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if,</v>

812
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they existed prior to corporatization,</v>

813
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.803
<v Speaker 1>I would say the power behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporatization is mutated and was </v>

814
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 1>present in some other form prior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

815
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And that it's about the preservation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power structures and always has been.</v>

816
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's so vehemently </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed.</v>

817
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Whenever anyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

818
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:36.820
<v Speaker 1>there's another world there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love is real.</v>

819
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 1>We're all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Whenever that message starts to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

821
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 1>people don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets dampened down pretty quick.</v>

822
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.321
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

823
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:46.154
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the suppression of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why these revolutions </v>

824
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:51.230
<v Speaker 2>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

825
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

826
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.653
<v Speaker 2>what it leaves at the materialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview where from which God's been </v>

827
00:43:56.511 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 2>removed or relentlessly St Kilda society</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves people alone,</v>

828
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 2>isolated and the privacy of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>skulls.</v>

829
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is it's a well,</v>

830
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.133
<v Speaker 2>it's meaningless and depressing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why depression is the endemic </v>

831
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:11.503
<v Speaker 2>disease of modern societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's exactly why I think that in </v>

832
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.633
<v Speaker 2>the secular age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when many people have lost contact with </v>

833
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>traditional religions and spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices are so important.</v>

834
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.753
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I my most recent books </v>
<v Speaker 2>called science and spiritual practices </v>

835
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:30.810
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

836
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.133
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paradoxical thing is the sort of </v>

837
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:35.934
<v Speaker 2>ironic that people think of science as </v>
<v Speaker 2>against spirituality when if you </v>

838
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 2>actually use science correctly and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>look in an open minded way,</v>

839
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.350
<v Speaker 2>you studied spiritual practices </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically,</v>

840
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.513
<v Speaker 2>like meditation for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it turns out the evidence is </v>

841
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:52.404
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming.</v>

842
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 2>This is very good for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who do it are happier,</v>

843
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live longer.</v>

844
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:02.100
<v Speaker 2>people have figured out which bits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain changed during meditation,</v>

846
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 2>lowering stress levels sleep better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

847
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 2>the scientific evidence suggests these </v>
<v Speaker 2>are very,</v>

848
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.930
<v Speaker 2>these practices are very good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my book,</v>

849
00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:14.600
<v Speaker 2>how I deal with a number of other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like um,</v>

850
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:15.803
<v Speaker 2>connecting with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very important practice for a </v>

851
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 2>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including me and pilgrimage.</v>

852
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 2>There's an amazing revival of pilgrimage</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in Europe at the moment.</v>

853
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:26.364
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably the one that </v>

854
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>most clearly expresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

855
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 2>the fact that so many people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on a journey,</v>

856
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:35.454
<v Speaker 2>they want to go somewhere there </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that connects them with </v>

857
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:38.484
<v Speaker 2>something bigger than themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the physical journey of a </v>

858
00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.080
<v Speaker 2>pilgrimages and expression of that such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

859
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.320
<v Speaker 2>for teleology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

860
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:48.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a purpose to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

861
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey and the,</v>

862
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting an a pilgrimage to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy place,</v>

863
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:57.100
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to a place which holy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and healing come from the same root.</v>

864
00:45:57.101 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to a place that can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a healing effect on you.</v>

865
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 2>You think then that</v>

866
00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:04.683
<v Speaker 1>we live our lives extracted from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of principles until they are </v>

867
00:46:08.141 --> 00:46:12.100
<v Speaker 1>somehow scientifically verified that w w</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said about meditation,</v>

868
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:14.400
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot that you know,</v>

869
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.423
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness and meditation and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken or from a perspective of </v>

870
00:46:18.101 --> 00:46:21.550
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has been necessarily secularized.</v>

871
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:22.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I find it kind of </v>

872
00:46:24.881 --> 00:46:27.760
<v Speaker 1>irritating I suppose because meditation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

873
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:28.643
<v Speaker 1>it was being present and suggested and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed through religious ideologies </v>

874
00:46:33.251 --> 00:46:36.220
<v Speaker 1>for Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was it,</v>

875
00:46:36.221 --> 00:46:37.054
<v Speaker 1>and these conclusions were reached not </v>
<v Speaker 1>by impure at wouldn't work perhaps by </v>

876
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:42.100
<v Speaker 1>empirical means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not by scientific means.</v>

877
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what other notions found in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theology would be similarly beneficial.</v>

878
00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.203
<v Speaker 1>I don't query the need for change as in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the examples that you've already given </v>

879
00:46:57.281 --> 00:47:02.281
<v Speaker 1>the revolutionary changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nor do I dispute at how religion has</v>

880
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:07.030
<v Speaker 1>been used to support power to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

881
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.811
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

882
00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:10.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engine bigotry and oppression.</v>

883
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:11.523
<v Speaker 1>Those are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

884
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:13.510
<v Speaker 1>but like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my belief system,</v>

885
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

886
00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:15.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

887
00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:17.620
<v Speaker 1>a line be quick to see where religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

888
00:47:17.621 --> 00:47:20.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this mindfulness example,</v>

889
00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:22.150
<v Speaker 1>and possibly what you're saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrimage,</v>

890
00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 1>about purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when w w it anecdotally,</v>

891
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 1>my experience of the world is even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to people,</v>

892
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>they feel lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>

893
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.280
<v Speaker 1>disconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.114
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could arrive at these </v>

895
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:33.484
<v Speaker 1>conclusions for Marxist theory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism would lead to alienation and </v>

896
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 1>people feeling that their only function </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an economic one or a productive one.</v>

897
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.153
<v Speaker 1>So as you're saying that these group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally these traditional ideas such </v>

898
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:49.474
<v Speaker 1>as pilgrimage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a new way of reengaging with </v>

899
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our consciousness that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be neglected?</v>

900
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

901
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's re-engaging because it's </v>

902
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 2>going on a journey to something that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than you.</v>

903
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year I've been doing this,</v>

905
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I have a Godson who's a teenager and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

906
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel as a godfather I should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something for his birthday.</v>

907
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:15.304
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it stopped giving stuff to people </v>

908
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 2>because I think everyone's got too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

909
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 2>So I give experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he was 14,</v>

910
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I offered him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

911
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.880
<v Speaker 2>my offer is a pilgrimage to Canterbury </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewalk,</v>

912
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 2>the last eight miles through fields on </v>
<v Speaker 2>footpaths and words.</v>

913
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.563
<v Speaker 2>We go to the cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we light candles at the shrine of some </v>

914
00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Thomas go to choral even song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which this beautiful service and um,</v>

915
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:43.110
<v Speaker 2>have a cream tea and come home on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>high speed train.</v>

916
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.670
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you like to do that?</v>

917
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And slate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to my surprise,</v>

918
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>he said yes and we had a blissful day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do that every year.</v>

919
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 2>No two different cathedrals.</v>

920
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

921
00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that you need to,</v>

922
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:58.130
<v Speaker 1>other than in the context of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

923
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I align your anglicanism with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying about morphic resonance.</v>

924
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:03.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a very,</v>

925
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.570
<v Speaker 1>what would people would deckard is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional faith?</v>

926
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

927
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:09.184
<v Speaker 2>it's not very conventional to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian and modern Britain and you've </v>

928
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:15.340
<v Speaker 2>got 5% of people go to church regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

929
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:16.503
<v Speaker 2>so it's definitely not the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and nunes in it for the money </v>

930
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:23.990
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

931
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.913
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphic resonance actually fits very </v>

932
00:49:26.471 --> 00:49:27.304
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in my book on science and </v>

933
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 2>spiritual practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>

934
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:31.384
<v Speaker 2>I discussed his rituals and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions have rituals and secular </v>

935
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.304
<v Speaker 2>cultures do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are some rituals of secular </v>

936
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>culture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

937
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.090
<v Speaker 2>the American thanksgiving festival for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

938
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:43.953
<v Speaker 2>so national ritual rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reenact and original seminal moment in </v>

939
00:49:49.871 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the history of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jewish people for example,</v>

940
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 2>reenact the Passover dinner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in Egypt when they fast</v>

941
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 1>foreman for ancestor worship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

942
00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:00.994
<v Speaker 1>And to demonstrate that we exist beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>our individual selves and the connected </v>

943
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:04.534
<v Speaker 1>to our lineage.</v>

944
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.643
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back to an original event that sets </v>

945
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:08.194
<v Speaker 2>the lineage in motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Christian holy communion is a </v>

946
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:16.231
<v Speaker 2>ritual celebration of Jesus's last </v>
<v Speaker 2>supper with his disciples itself,</v>

947
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>a Passover dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

948
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:18.964
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of ancestral connection </v>

949
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 2>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point about morphic resonance,</v>

950
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:24.904
<v Speaker 2>it depends on similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you have a ritual where you use </v>

951
00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 2>the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same words,</v>

952
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:32.220
<v Speaker 2>the same gestures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same incense,</v>

953
00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the same whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

954
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.113
<v Speaker 2>you deliberately create things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar as possible and you set up </v>

955
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 2>perfect conditions for morphic </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonance.</v>

956
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.023
<v Speaker 2>So in all cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe that by doing these </v>

957
00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 2>rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they connect with our ancestors.</v>

958
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.523
<v Speaker 2>Have done them before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right back to the first time it's done </v>

959
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 2>and it means the individual individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than just me.</v>

960
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.713
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of a whole long tradition that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went on long before me and we'll go on </v>

961
00:50:56.931 --> 00:50:57.764
<v Speaker 2>long after me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this whole tradition in any case is </v>

962
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:03.850
<v Speaker 2>about something bigger than us because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

963
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 2>his last supper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Passover,</v>

964
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.630
<v Speaker 2>it was about more than just those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

965
00:51:08.631 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 2>It was a in their own terms of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention of God into history.</v>

966
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

967
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So my individual consciousness is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporal,</v>

968
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but my consciousness has existed before </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my consciousness will exist after</v>

969
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.440
<v Speaker 1>me and my consciousness is part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vital energy,</v>

970
00:51:22.441 --> 00:51:23.274
<v Speaker 1>a continual pranic flow existing through</v>
<v Speaker 1>all forms existing beyond and through </v>

971
00:51:27.601 --> 00:51:28.434
<v Speaker 1>time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and space themselves being just </v>

972
00:51:30.391 --> 00:51:31.224
<v Speaker 1>referential points from this biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism or this species of biological </v>

973
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:39.360
<v Speaker 1>organisms that would be entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different if we had different senses.</v>

974
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.373
<v Speaker 1>That consciousness is somehow reflecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the screen of reality rules that </v>

975
00:51:44.341 --> 00:51:45.174
<v Speaker 1>are apparent to its own understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its own interaction with the </v>

976
00:51:48.121 --> 00:51:51.210
<v Speaker 1>external and through these rituals we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can demonstrate it,</v>

977
00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:52.044
<v Speaker 1>recreate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with it in a different way and </v>

978
00:51:54.031 --> 00:51:57.360
<v Speaker 1>see how we have existed like waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>passing through time.</v>

979
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somehow stripped of mystery.</v>

980
00:52:00.361 --> 00:52:01.194
<v Speaker 1>These things can seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that some of our out there </v>

981
00:52:03.601 --> 00:52:06.150
<v Speaker 1>rather than more radical a listeners my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

982
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.013
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole cause to me it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody delightful going for the cream </v>

983
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:14.100
<v Speaker 1>tea and the pilgrimage to Canterbury's </v>
<v Speaker 1>or sort of thing I might do actually.</v>

984
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.170
<v Speaker 1>But like a lot of people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I ain't doing that.</v>

985
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh I want to do ios guy with a flick </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife.</v>

986
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Buyer would so like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like it doesn't it seem,</v>

987
00:52:22.471 --> 00:52:23.304
<v Speaker 1>it seems conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whilst you said it's like 5% day seems </v>

988
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

989
00:52:26.671 --> 00:52:28.350
<v Speaker 1>what does it seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it seem radical?</v>

990
00:52:28.351 --> 00:52:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>

991
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.190
<v Speaker 1>That thing that I'm feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems somehow,</v>

992
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:33.203
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe like it's not going to change the </v>

993
00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:35.184
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's had its moment that it's </v>

994
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.940
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

995
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an element of that </v>

996
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:42.511
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

997
00:52:42.511 --> 00:52:43.344
<v Speaker 2>anything that connects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider it nostalgics connect </v>

998
00:52:45.631 --> 00:52:48.960
<v Speaker 2>with tradition in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean here in Britain for example,</v>

999
00:52:48.961 --> 00:52:49.794
<v Speaker 2>we have incredible cathedrals and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>were produced in the middle ages when </v>

1000
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:54.263
<v Speaker 2>virtually everybody who believed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were part of something bigger than </v>

1001
00:52:56.851 --> 00:52:57.684
<v Speaker 2>themselves and the whole society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 3 million people with ox carts </v>

1002
00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:04.840
<v Speaker 2>and ropes and pulleys created all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible cathedrals.</v>

1003
00:53:04.841 --> 00:53:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Cantor breed our own wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salisbury of Centra,</v>

1004
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Westminster Abbey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought they were part of something</v>

1005
00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:14.790
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger than themselves.</v>

1006
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.840
<v Speaker 2>And they're still here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find them incredibly powerful.</v>

1007
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's just nostalgia.</v>

1008
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I think they have a living presence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who goes into them,</v>

1009
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're getting listened to</v>

1010
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>this evening service even song where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is it as this beautiful music.</v>

1011
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It's an extraordinarily beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming experience.</v>

1012
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Now I've nothing against Iowasca and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't like to say this is,</v>

1013
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 2>it's either all you see for me it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>either or.</v>

1014
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I think all the spiritual practices are </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what we can do.</v>

1015
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:50.784
<v Speaker 2>And there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many spiritual practices we can take </v>

1016
00:53:52.741 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>part in meditations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one rituals or another.</v>

1017
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.663
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kara has done as a kind of ritual as a </v>

1018
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of sacramental communion where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>participants,</v>

1019
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:07.120
<v Speaker 2>especially on these psychedelic churches</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Santo Dima.</v>

1020
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds good.</v>

1021
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 2>This is a Brazilian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very big psychedelic church in</v>

1022
00:54:13.201 --> 00:54:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was two actually more than two,</v>

1023
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 2>but the main ones are called sent who </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

1024
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you went to Fsu,</v>

1025
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.063
<v Speaker 2>tyler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means union of plants and these </v>

1026
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:23.754
<v Speaker 2>are churches I have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose I suppose I should add a long </v>

1027
00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:28.880
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1028
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.280
<v Speaker 2>to services these churches in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually watching the,</v>

1029
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>so the one they liked be psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>charities.</v>

1030
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated why they've got good </v>
<v Speaker 2>murals in them.</v>

1031
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.330
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] they don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these not,</v>

1032
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:45.263
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the wellies they may be doing in </v>

1033
00:54:47.331 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is sort of in a room where they</v>

1034
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:54.651
<v Speaker 2>rent rooms and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they are at Inosanto,</v>

1035
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:57.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe men are all dressed in white on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one side of the room,</v>

1036
00:54:57.631 --> 00:54:58.464
<v Speaker 2>women on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it started to my surprise with </v>

1037
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.410
<v Speaker 2>everyone reciting the our father and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hail Mary.</v>

1038
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:05.244
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the kind of community </v>

1039
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:11.510
<v Speaker 2>where you all go up one after another </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drink from this chalice of Iowasca.</v>

1040
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.533
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole group is traveling </v>

1041
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 2>together and the person leading it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:55:17.131 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just personal tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1043
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 2>we're all in this together and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling like in a boat together.</v>

1044
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.173
<v Speaker 2>And there's periods when you sing </v>
<v Speaker 2>together extraordinarily beautiful </v>

1045
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:26.994
<v Speaker 2>songs.</v>

1046
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.253
<v Speaker 2>And then periods when everyone sits in </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence and has kind of visionary </v>

1047
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my case,</v>

1048
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:33.963
<v Speaker 2>for the first time he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was sort of zooming out of the </v>

1049
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 2>earth into the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the stars,</v>

1050
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 2>and it was astonishing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1051
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and then you come back and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another song.</v>

1052
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 2>And as the country was very strong sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of group solidarity.</v>

1053
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:54.110
<v Speaker 2>But I don't see that that is is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I see that as a perfectly compatible </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lots of other religious [inaudible]</v>

1055
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 2>sat around having your cream tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sounds much more radical to me.</v>

1056
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:02.723
<v Speaker 2>I went to this church repat in ladbroke </v>
<v Speaker 2>grove quite by mistake as a matter of </v>

1057
00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like I wonder then and it was,</v>

1058
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I like to discover Eritrean Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>folk.</v>

1059
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 2>They had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a screen at the front.</v>

1060
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 2>They will listen to pretty crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard music.</v>

1061
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:17.874
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else sat me with Airtran and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little kid at the back and a tiny </v>

1062
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:20.934
<v Speaker 2>plastic chassis was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be there in some sort of </v>

1063
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.090
<v Speaker 2>administrative up the front</v>

1064
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.620
<v Speaker 1>was the pastor and a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1065
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>

1066
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you know like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the,</v>

1067
00:56:31.581 --> 00:56:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it was like a feel Jesus type levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and a guy like,</v>

1068
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:36.274
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was going out the front and </v>

1069
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:37.864
<v Speaker 1>having like proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked to me like speaking in </v>

1070
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 1>tongues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of body kind of experiences.</v>

1071
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.760
<v Speaker 1>While I was watching this all happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>

1072
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 1>from the midst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the congregation,</v>

1073
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 1>which was only about 30 or 40 people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this church.</v>

1074
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking how,</v>

1075
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:54.550
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to go home afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1076
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:56.230
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to pick up our coats </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1077
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:57.103
<v Speaker 1>Car Keys and be normal again like after </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have letting ourselves go after we </v>

1078
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 1>have dispensed temporarily with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity is hello there cnn.</v>

1079
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:05.883
<v Speaker 1>I suppose this is what I mean while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a cream tea or you're </v>

1080
00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 1>walking in a field is still essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1081
00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 1>but while you're shooting through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos on Iowaska,</v>

1082
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:12.783
<v Speaker 1>you asked if physically experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are not just your identity is </v>

1083
00:57:16.121 --> 00:57:16.954
<v Speaker 1>rupert or Russell or whoever you happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be listening to this thing right now </v>

1084
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.753
<v Speaker 1>and watching these Eritrean people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>congregation of watched them having a </v>

1085
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:25.010
<v Speaker 1>group experience that was clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>

1086
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 1>which was clearly outside the accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>social rules.</v>

1087
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I've thought how will this sees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how will it comes to cessation?</v>

1088
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:31.594
<v Speaker 1>I went to the front of my cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pastor did some ritual on me </v>

1089
00:57:34.661 --> 00:57:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and where my set killer mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition mind would say that it was all</v>

1090
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Brouhaha and nonsense except for when </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he offered me the healing.</v>

1091
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:45.214
<v Speaker 1>The place in my stomach that you grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>is exactly where I feel the pain when </v>

1092
00:57:47.951 --> 00:57:48.784
<v Speaker 1>alone anxious and full of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The place that you grabbed that was the </v>

1093
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:54.070
<v Speaker 1>place where I feel the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1094
00:57:54.071 --> 00:57:54.904
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end things did resolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite perfectly and beautifully and </v>

1095
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 1>people just chat it afterwards and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to their jobs.</v>

1096
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:02.044
<v Speaker 1>In these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking a lot of these people were </v>

1097
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 1>cab drivers and doing pre low pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum paid,</v>

1098
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had there a communal experience</v>

1099
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and and I and a I transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1100
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Certainly it was beyond the accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>social norms of how are you,</v>

1101
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to be doing next </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday?</v>

1102
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you see spurs the other night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were,</v>

1103
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and I feel that if you exclude that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience from your life,</v>

1104
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 1>if your life does not include that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what are you doing?</v>

1105
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.190
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1106
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.333
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that without that kind of </v>

1107
00:58:33.601 --> 00:58:36.990
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lead very impoverished lives.</v>

1108
00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:38.003
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think like you do that </v>

1109
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:45.390
<v Speaker 2>spiritual practices and awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dimension is so important.</v>

1110
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.050
<v Speaker 1>What should science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can science,</v>

1111
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.390
<v Speaker 1>which you know no one disputes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without science?</v>

1112
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.250
<v Speaker 1>No technology without science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no medicine.</v>

1113
00:58:52.251 --> 00:58:54.020
<v Speaker 1>All the things that you listed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1114
00:58:54.021 --> 00:58:56.360
<v Speaker 1>the experimental method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely vital.</v>

1115
00:58:56.361 --> 00:58:58.370
<v Speaker 1>But is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

1116
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.160
<v Speaker 1>what would your biggest hope be for </v>
<v Speaker 1>science?</v>

1117
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going beyond these narrow dogmas,</v>

1118
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.140
<v Speaker 2>hold it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My book,</v>

1119
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.093
<v Speaker 2>the Science Delusion in America is </v>
<v Speaker 2>called science set free and it's really </v>

1120
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:13.953
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that if we escaped from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic prison that it's in at the </v>

1121
00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:19.414
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could become much more positive and </v>

1122
00:59:20.681 --> 00:59:21.514
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if we switch from a </v>

1123
00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:25.214
<v Speaker 2>view of nature as being dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unanimous and mechanical to a view of </v>

1124
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:34.721
<v Speaker 2>nature as a living cosmos that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving with habits and that everything</v>

1125
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 2>in nature is being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gaia,</v>

1126
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 2>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>

1127
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:39.440
<v Speaker 2>the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy,</v>

1128
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 2>plants and animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not machines,</v>

1129
00:59:41.571 --> 00:59:42.404
<v Speaker 2>but truly alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll find ourselves in the living </v>

1130
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:48.890
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has a kind of purpose is not clear</v>

1131
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:49.724
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it we'd feel much more connected if </v>

1132
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 2>we feed ourselves part of the living </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1133
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.413
<v Speaker 2>And then the kind of spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles that give rise to that world </v>

1134
00:59:59.631 --> 01:00:04.070
<v Speaker 2>or the creative forces that underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>would become,</v>

1135
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.353
<v Speaker 2>we'd feel they were more relevant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to us and we'd see God in nature </v>

1136
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 2>and God in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1137
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1138
01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and I think then when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives become much more connected,</v>

1139
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 2>much more meaningful and much happier </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1140
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

1141
01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:22.684
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't see why that would be </v>

1142
01:00:23.981 --> 01:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>controversial at all to regard the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those terms.</v>

1143
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Rupert sheldrake your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you this,</v>

1144
01:00:30.311 --> 01:00:31.360

<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just going to let you know in your book,</v>

1146
01:00:34.091 --> 01:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>science and spiritual practices is </v>
<v Speaker 1>available now.</v>

1147
01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1148
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed talking to you.</v>

1149
01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:42.814
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it incredibly valuable and </v>

1150
01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:49.951
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and to invest the world around</v>
<v Speaker 1>us with love and not to feel that we are</v>

1151
01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>just components in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1152
01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>a mindless and purpose less machine for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1153
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>This is not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1154
01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>this cheers me up on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1155
01:00:58.991 --> 01:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>on my road to the bone yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1156
01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it also just feels like it has truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think of nature,</v>

1157
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>when I think of my experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

1158
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:06.903
<v Speaker 1>it seems to confirm that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces beyond that which can be </v>

1159
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>understood through the limited senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is information available that</v>

1160
01:01:14.681 --> 01:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>can't be understood within the existing </v>
<v Speaker 1>template.</v>

1161
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be bloody obvious as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact,</v>

1162
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and that nature does seem like an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1163
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in motion,</v>

1164
01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>a living beautiful thing rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical resource.</v>

1165
01:01:28.331 --> 01:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you start looking at nature as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something other than a resource,</v>

1166
01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:32.164
<v Speaker 1>a lot of economic interests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political interests would be strongly </v>

1167
01:01:35.141 --> 01:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1168
01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great pleasure to don't try and </v>

1169
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the host of the thing.</v>

1170
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1171
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're getting signals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're meant to be wrapping it up.</v>

1172
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Refresh your drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go bloody Cathedra with yeah,</v>

1173
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.200
<v Speaker 2>it would take us in all about one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1174
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I word yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to go with you.</v>

1175
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:58.100
<v Speaker 2>We'd go to a cathedral would walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a field and like weird.</v>

1176
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Let me just have a cream tea and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd go work aphasia.</v>

1177
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best ones?</v>

1178
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.833
<v Speaker 2>Dharam cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we could start with Westminster </v>

1179
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Abbey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite spectacular and amazing.</v>

1180
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.863
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1181
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And they do choral even song practically</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

1182
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Even song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned it all the time.</v>

1183
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>You're not the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best way.</v>

1184
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:16.664
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done done this empirically know </v>

1185
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.730
<v Speaker 2>what works for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1186
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>if people are committed Christians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy communion is the best way.</v>

1187
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if people are not used to that,</v>

1188
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>then choral even song is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can include everybody.</v>

1189
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely beautiful and it lasts 45</v>

1190
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>minutes and it happens every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all know cathedrals.</v>

1191
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.573
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a website that I helped set up </v>

1192
01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:47.730
<v Speaker 2>called choral even song.org</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can find out when the next one</v>

1193
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:48.564
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're singing and what kind of </v>

1194
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:50.844
<v Speaker 2>choir too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna investigate what it was like </v>

<v Speaker 2>for those people.</v>
