<v Speaker 1>I'm very grateful of being here.</v>

17
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I've like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people at home know,</v>

18
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.513
<v Speaker 1>I've been trained training mostly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>here on for just a one week for five </v>

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.433
<v Speaker 1>little five hour long sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that fascinates me most </v>

20
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:15.784
<v Speaker 1>about Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are fans of martial arts </v>

21
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>will be aware of its efficacy of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>People that know your family and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>online work.</v>

23
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.384
<v Speaker 1>We'll know that there is a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiar component to what you do as a </v>

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>marketer martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've been particularly struck by a</v>

25
00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>kind of openness and a kind of warmth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a kind of love.</v>

26
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.173
<v Speaker 1>There was something about it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprises me a great deal to start this </v>

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.033
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you explain to me a little about </v>

28
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Helio Gracie and the foundation of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is known as Gracie Jujitsu,</v>

29
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe racy or grandfather for those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

30
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

31
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>thanks for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome for us.</v>

32
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:56.324
<v Speaker 2>We were delighted to get the call that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were here and one of the train </v>

33
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and for our viewing audience out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and our listening audience,</v>

34
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.453
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell has only had a little bit of </v>

35
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.064
<v Speaker 2>training here with us in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is training in the UK and has </v>

36
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:07.904
<v Speaker 2>been consistent for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's always beautiful when Jujitsu </v>

37
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 2>has another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.373
<v Speaker 2>influential figure like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>join the family and be able to </v>

39
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>perpetuate the amazingness of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so lucky to grow up with,</v>

40
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 1>especially someone that's so good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu as I am.</v>

41
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>But they laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laugh.</v>

42
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have all the attributes?</v>

43
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.374
<v Speaker 2>You've got the legs for the triangle </v>
<v Speaker 2>chokes and you've been incredibly </v>

44
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 2>dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

45
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of what you said about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

46
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 2>the warmth and the amazingness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

47
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>while you were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

48
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense that it's kind of a shock</v>

49
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.083
<v Speaker 2>to someone who gets involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting art to be received with the </v>

50
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 2>warmth and the gentility and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

51
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of what is the Gracie Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jitsu,</v>

52
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.493
<v Speaker 2>something that you might not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with it before you kind of </v>

53
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>ventured into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

54
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this art as,</v>

55
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 2>as you begin and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're absolutely right then that we</v>

56
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>can trace that back to our grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really the core of what Jujitsu is,</v>

57
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.943
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is the most gentle martial art </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet and self defense system </v>

59
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.954
<v Speaker 2>while also being the most effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have the ability to not only </v>

60
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.274
<v Speaker 2>defend ourselves against an attacker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we have to defend ourselves </v>

61
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>against someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get hurt.</v>

62
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be okay.</v>

63
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.173
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it was in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your grandfather that meant that </v>

64
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he evolved through your family,</v>

65
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.800
<v Speaker 1>has maintained this kind of gentleness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it about him as a man?</v>

66
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather was very frail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very light,</v>

67
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:32.004
<v Speaker 2>very small as whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had to be the most technical </v>

68
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>person in the room and because he was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical,</v>

69
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 2>naturally he can't rely on his physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes.</v>

70
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.900
<v Speaker 2>He can't go out there and beat people </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

71
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 2>So the gentility I think started there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was six [inaudible] three,</v>

72
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.623
<v Speaker 2>225 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it wouldn't have been a gentle </v>

73
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:52.014
<v Speaker 2>experience for you this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that he was as small as he </v>

74
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:56.130
<v Speaker 2>was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of continued,</v>

75
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was so passionate about,</v>

76
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>which was being technical</v>

77
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.703
<v Speaker 1>inception of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that disadvantages can become </v>

78
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.473
<v Speaker 1>advantages be seeded in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that something that would be </v>

79
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>considered a disadvantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being frail,</v>

80
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.803
<v Speaker 1>being small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things can be turned to an </v>

81
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:15.834
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for me already seems like an </v>

82
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>interesting philosophical point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as well as being like,</v>

83
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.380
<v Speaker 1>of course a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I love all the gentleness and the warm </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nada,</v>

85
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origins of this are in Brazil.</v>

86
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of combat,</v>

87
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>a lot of honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your grandfather demonstrate in</v>

88
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the effectiveness of these principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

89
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

90
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.340
<v Speaker 1>And just tell us a bit about that.</v>

91
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda how the West was won.</v>

92
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>It was these challenge matches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

93
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:43.494
<v Speaker 2>So if you do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this guy over here does karate and </v>

94
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.560
<v Speaker 2>both think they are the most effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts on the planet,</v>

95
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 2>you have to fight to see which one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more effective.</v>

96
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.093
<v Speaker 2>We have to have a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A debate when it comes to martial arts </v>

97
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 2>is basically a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conversation and they're,</v>

98
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 2>they're done in a spirit of education </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit of exploration.</v>

99
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather never considered himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>a professional fighter,</v>

100
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 2>like a prize fighter like you see today </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

101
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and professional boxers.</v>

102
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do it for the sport of it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even for the money of it.</v>

103
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.143
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather was a teacher of Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>who fought other people in no rules </v>

104
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:21.330
<v Speaker 2>settings to prove that did you through </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was teaching was effective.</v>

105
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 2>That was his demonstration of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness.</v>

106
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.723
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas someone else might just fight </v>

107
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of getting paid or the fame</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

108
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.213
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather fought because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed what he was teaching was </v>

109
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>effective and how else could he prove </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

110
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Then by choking someone out who was much</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger,</v>

111
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>much heavier and much more athletic than</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

112
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.090
<v Speaker 1>must have had phenomenal drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>

113
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must've been,</v>

114
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.853
<v Speaker 1>this is a man that had a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission because to take a Jujitsu from </v>

115
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>where it was in what the 1920s is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>23rd is,</v>

117
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is today.</v>

118
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:56.001
<v Speaker 1>Of course his sons and your generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also contributed incredibly to this</v>

119
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:57.504
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to the UFC and that kind of </v>

120
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>stuff and your father's work with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like what do you think,</v>

121
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>what do you think drove him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made him want to do all that?</v>

122
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.930
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 2>he always tells the stories about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

124
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Two did for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when he was a very young teenager.</v>

125
00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 2>And he started learning these techniques</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much it helped him,</v>

126
00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 2>how he could barely run up a flight of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>

127
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And he was not athletic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starts learning Jujitsu from watching</v>

128
00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:25.530
<v Speaker 2>and before you know what he's teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in a little bit.</v>

129
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:30.531
<v Speaker 2>And now he's on the mat teaching a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So jujitsu made took him from this frail</v>

130
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:35.640
<v Speaker 2>little kid to a superhero to Brazil is </v>
<v Speaker 2>first national sports hero.</v>

131
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.200
<v Speaker 2>So if Jujitsu did so much for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels like,</v>

132
00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:41.034
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt like I had to show us with the </v>

133
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:43.254
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I not give this if it saved my </v>

134
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it began his selfish.</v>

135
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 2>It began as I'm doing this right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a little skinny little white</v>

136
00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

137
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I needed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need this for myself for survival.</v>

138
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:54.954
<v Speaker 2>It began with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it ended with service and now he's </v>

139
00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 2>affected just by his actions and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his kind of,</v>

140
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

141
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:02.011
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

142
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his future generations.</v>

143
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his successors,</v>

144
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.433
<v Speaker 2>that the whole world martial arts will </v>
<v Speaker 2>never be the same and can never be </v>

146
00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:12.750
<v Speaker 2>undone for the work that that little guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>did in Brazil.</v>

147
00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the family bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>into America and our whole lives.</v>

148
00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 2>He always said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys Jujitsu,</v>

149
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody can do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for anybody.</v>

150
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.700
<v Speaker 2>But like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very gentle place and you were</v>

151
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:24.534
<v Speaker 2>a little bit surprised as to how </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant it was here at Grace </v>

152
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.980
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People often think like,</v>

153
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.900
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't of Jujitsu is for me.</v>

154
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:31.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

155
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 2>But any grace he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

156
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt Jujitsu is for you.</v>

157
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 2>It's for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

158
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:37.171
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

159
00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:40.590
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he knew that because it was for him.</v>

160
00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:42.150
<v Speaker 2>And if he could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

161
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Being who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you can do,</v>

162
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.313
<v Speaker 2>he is the lowest common denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he could do it and grow the way </v>

163
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:50.970
<v Speaker 2>he did and no one is exempt from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning process and the growing process</v>

164
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:55.971
<v Speaker 2>and also what he believed you had to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do Jujitsu was very little.</v>

165
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Somebody might think that Jujitsu is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.903
<v Speaker 2>rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody overwhelmed them with punches </v>

167
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:02.094
<v Speaker 2>and take them down and arm bar them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He to him Jujitsu is simply managing </v>

168
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good communication,</v>

169
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.280
<v Speaker 2>talking to the person down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>

170
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 2>It could be a little bit of heat up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting punched in the face,</v>

171
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 2>not getting a headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just simply surviving.</v>

172
00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:17.304
<v Speaker 2>Just things safe for two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes until somebody breaks the fight </v>

173
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:20.484
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just did amazing Jujitsu and who </v>

174
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:22.524
<v Speaker 2>can't use that.</v>

175
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.433
<v Speaker 1>He had a personal mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The innocence is comparable to other </v>

176
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people feel about spirituality,</v>

177
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>like people that have experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

178
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They think I've got to share this </v>
<v Speaker 1>message with the world or perhaps myself</v>

179
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:40.330
<v Speaker 1>with recovery from drugs and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a sort of a comparable sense of,</v>

180
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to help other people with this.</v>

181
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I want people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

182
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel an obligation that if I can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

183
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.970
<v Speaker 1>other people can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

184
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that that at the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where uh,</v>

185
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 1>this art was conceived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about someone that,</v>

186
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:57.054
<v Speaker 1>that they were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were vulnerable on inefficient or even </v>

188
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>as you have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so smaller,</v>

189
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.900
<v Speaker 1>weaker guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

190
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.823
<v Speaker 1>like now this is something that's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to me learning it because like </v>

191
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>as we have discussed when I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the personal sessions,</v>

192
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:08.904
<v Speaker 1>it's like for me it's about access in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of myself that I'm not being </v>

193
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.673
<v Speaker 1>comfortable accessing before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems important that within this </v>

194
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:19.434
<v Speaker 1>forum that you're super efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be seen as being about </v>

195
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domination,</v>

196
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

197
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.603
<v Speaker 1>Is there a significant aspect of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peculiar that that's continued now and </v>

198
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>we talk a lot about how the,</v>

199
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.293
<v Speaker 2>the more you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you realize how much you don't </v>

200
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I should very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the vulnerability,</v>

202
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>the moment you step on this mat in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

203
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:41.840
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very vulnerable.</v>

204
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.273
<v Speaker 2>Which is why I guess everybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is not walking into a Jujitsu </v>

205
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.430
<v Speaker 2>school because they fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:52.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe being embarrassed or being injured</v>
<v Speaker 2>or being,</v>

207
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overpowered.</v>

208
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vulnerability,</v>

209
00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.294
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot to come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you do come in here and start </v>

210
00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>to really work on that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability,</v>

211
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.410
<v Speaker 2>they think the possibilities are </v>
<v Speaker 2>endless.</v>

212
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>And with you in particular as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning that the,</v>

213
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>what we felt is that we'll show you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and let's see,</v>

214
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:09.404
<v Speaker 2>a technique only requires 10% of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and energy in that particular </v>

215
00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As someone who's newer to Jujitsu,</v>

216
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.243
<v Speaker 2>you do what most the everyone does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you put 100% of your strength </v>

217
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.810
<v Speaker 2>to accomplish something that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires 10% of your strength.</v>

218
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.030
<v Speaker 2>And we laugh about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

219
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>

220
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:29.660
<v Speaker 2>you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you even said this to me,</v>

221
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:30.110
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

222
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.943
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm overreacting to the threat stimulus </v>

223
00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>here because that's all I've ever done </v>
<v Speaker 2>my whole life.</v>

224
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.280
<v Speaker 2>It's when there's a threat or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertain too,</v>

225
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm uncomfortable or it's it's fight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight,</v>

226
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>I fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I go 100% in response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

228
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.993
<v Speaker 2>and I think that you're making a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery for yourself as we're doing </v>

229
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:46.881
<v Speaker 2>this and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

230
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:47.714
<v Speaker 2>why am I death gripping him right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he just told me that I can do it </v>

231
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 2>with 90% less energy and still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective?</v>

232
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

233
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's important to kind of reflect </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

234
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.461
<v Speaker 2>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't,</v>

235
00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't taken that technique into </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

236
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not tested it enough to trust it like we</v>

237
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:05.960
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

238
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.793
<v Speaker 2>I trust the move to where I can use 10% </v>
<v Speaker 2>15% because I know what I believe in </v>

239
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:12.224
<v Speaker 2>that move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as I believe in anything in the </v>

240
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:15.290
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just learned it yesterday.</v>

241
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust that move with your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

242
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:18.803
<v Speaker 2>So you have to do it 17 1947300500 times</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then eventually and none of that </v>

243
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:26.870
<v Speaker 2>with different levels of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually you're going to say,</v>

244
00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:27.704
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is on top of me painting me to </v>

245
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a problem.</v>

246
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Life is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

247
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I have the trap and roll</v>

248
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.253
<v Speaker 1>because I tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things I learned </v>

249
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>from listening to you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fear.</v>

250
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It plays a part in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like it.</v>

251
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:44.354
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of my psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's areas in my life </v>

252
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>where I feel very competent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>

253
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.240
<v Speaker 1>still fear is very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

254
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>while I've been training with you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>this week,</v>

255
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:54.424
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing standup comedy gigs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that even something that I'm </v>

256
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>very experienced in doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

257
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

258
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's my job almost to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear to come into me.</v>

259
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I respond to fear that if I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling frightened,</v>

260
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

261
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>But because when I was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it was you that said,</v>

262
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:12.184
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that when you are on the green </v>

263
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 1>mat in a fire situation for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is home.</v>

264
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my home.</v>

265
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

266
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>so the next Gig I did before it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought.</v>

267
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Right now this is my home going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this place.</v>

268
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>It's natural that I feel these feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of adrenaline.</v>

269
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not true that this energy is coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>into my body but I want to use it.</v>

270
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.320
<v Speaker 1>You said another thing about that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his exact name,</v>

271
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it was called dragon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

272
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leo Machida,</v>

273
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:39.094
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon [inaudible] you said that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that a fight situation is too </v>

274
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:46.891
<v Speaker 1>complex to predict the outcome or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do is apply your personal fidelity.</v>

275
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Now this for me is a very spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

276
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:52.160
<v Speaker 1>so before the Gig I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how this Gig,</v>

277
00:12:52.161 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go too many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much chaos.</v>

278
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>All I know is if I stay connected to who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

279
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.070
<v Speaker 1>if I can observe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I will be in a good position to lou</v>

280
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 1>use my skills in that area.</v>

281
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.193
<v Speaker 1>I do have trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have trust days possible to for me </v>

282
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:09.094
<v Speaker 1>to succeed by like in a new environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one could say this is a very primal </v>

283
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Speaker 1>thing you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're male or female.</v>

284
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.193
<v Speaker 1>Fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that another human being can </v>

285
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 1>dominate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliate you,</v>

286
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>use you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a energy,</v>

287
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe even lizard energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is energy,</v>

288
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>this deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

289
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 1>deep in the consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these techniques I think are posses.</v>

290
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Changing consciousness is changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

291
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.173
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk more of course about your </v>

292
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk more about the UFC,</v>

293
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:40.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very interested in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

294
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>with this phase of the evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gracie Jujitsu.</v>

295
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.583
<v Speaker 1>You're very interested in programs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying programs for female </v>

296
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:49.564
<v Speaker 1>empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to talk to me a little </v>

297
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 1>bit about that stuff and why it's here?</v>

298
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a big deal for us.</v>

299
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:54.754
<v Speaker 2>Like we grew up in a family and in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>era where everything was about proving </v>

300
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu's effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was fights.</v>

301
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:01.234
<v Speaker 2>It was my dad created the UFC to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Jujitsu is better than all the </v>

302
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 2>other martial arts and hoist went in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

303
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 2>our uncle and did very well and put us </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the map.</v>

304
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:08.884
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather did all that previously </v>

305
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:11.014
<v Speaker 2>in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this proving era was a very </v>

306
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>aggressive state of proving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proving,</v>

307
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 2>proving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came off as,</v>

308
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

309
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

310
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.603
<v Speaker 2>as an era of just showing superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was really demonstrating </v>

311
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness so that students would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

312
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to learn something,</v>

313
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn what those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>skinny Brazilians are doing because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

315
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 2>if they could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so can I.</v>

316
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.063
<v Speaker 2>That was the goal there was to inspire </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eagerness to learn that was </v>

317
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:35.044
<v Speaker 2>accomplished and it basically nine 1993 </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 94 95 and then since then </v>

318
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 2>it's been a known fact that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your duty was the quintessential art for</v>

319
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:43.360
<v Speaker 2>mma.</v>

320
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.193
<v Speaker 2>So everyone kind of accepts that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where we are today and him and I </v>

321
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.630
<v Speaker 2>coming up through that era and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

322
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:49.464
<v Speaker 2>early teenagers when that was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we had to mature through that </v>

323
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:52.244
<v Speaker 2>and figure out what was going to be our </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling and what was going to be our </v>

324
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>really our focus for the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's our contribution to this legacy?</v>

325
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>And the conclusion was the demand for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu was unprecedented.</v>

326
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.504
<v Speaker 2>The world wants to learn Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What didn't exist is structured </v>

327
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.123
<v Speaker 2>distribution mechanisms to get Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>from our family to the world in </v>

328
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.133
<v Speaker 2>instructure demographic specific ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would reach and penetrate all the </v>

329
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 2>necessary audiences so that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>could benefit.</v>

330
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Because Teaching Jujitsu to a police </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer who has to go arrest the suspect</v>

331
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>nonviolently and keep his gun in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>holster is different than teaching it to</v>

332
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 2>a survivor of sexual assault.</v>

333
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.983
<v Speaker 2>And it's different than teaching it to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid who walks to school every day with </v>

334
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 2>his hand sweating because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know when that bolt is going to approach</v>

335
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:41.240
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every one of those needs Jujitsu but how</v>

336
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you communicate it to them is completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

337
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.103
<v Speaker 2>So what we are responsible for is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the specialization of Jujitsu into </v>

338
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 2>demographics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific courses,</v>

339
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof for children,</v>

340
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Gracie survival tactics for law </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement,</v>

341
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Gracie combatives for the everyday </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian who wants to learn self defense</v>

342
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 2>men or women just in the least amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time possible.</v>

343
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Women in power to defend against sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault.</v>

344
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>All of them are the based on the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>

345
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 2>same concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same techniques.</v>

346
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Our family has been perfecting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a hundred years,</v>

347
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.573
<v Speaker 2>but every single one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicated completely differently to </v>

348
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:17.294
<v Speaker 2>their audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was really our biggest </v>

349
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.144
<v Speaker 2>contribution and then putting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>online so that all of that was </v>

350
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 2>accessible anywhere in the world through</v>
<v Speaker 2>gracie university.com</v>

351
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.773
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really cemented our contribution </v>

352
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 2>and now it's just growing and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

353
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 2>more teaching to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all in that thought of,</v>

354
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it available for everyone.</v>

355
00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Just literally Jujitsu for everyone.</v>

356
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.703
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu then is a kind of a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from my personal experience of </v>

357
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu prior with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're excellent teachers.</v>

358
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I've had back in the UK at Genesis Jam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give him a little shout out cause I</v>

359
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 1>love him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul and Chris,</v>

360
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 1>like what our thinking is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

361
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>This thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

362
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:53.294
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a little kid saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat is on the mat while they're able to </v>

363
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:58.934
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feline creature rests now for a </v>

364
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>moment on the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like watching them move,</v>

365
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>watching the patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lucidness,</v>

366
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>the vividness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of the language now.</v>

367
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.943
<v Speaker 1>So the inception of a Jujitsu as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss it with respect to your </v>

368
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>grandfather was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

369
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>this is able to overcome my feelings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and weakness.</v>

370
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.713
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the most effective form of </v>

371
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>combat against even other trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

372
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.133
<v Speaker 1>And now what your personal mission has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become as the heads of this part of the </v>

373
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:29.564
<v Speaker 1>family is the heads of this journey is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want this language to be understood </v>

374
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.940
<v Speaker 1>by people everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

375
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.823
<v Speaker 1>100%</v>

376
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 2>anybody who who you said walks this </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet has insecurities.</v>

377
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's worried,</v>

378
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody's scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's,</v>

379
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about their personal or the </v>

380
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 2>safety of their loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's going to be some time in your</v>

381
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>life or something's going to happen when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that day comes.</v>

382
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 2>We talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can provide through digital that they</v>

383
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 2>need to get through that hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is literally different languages.</v>

384
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.423
<v Speaker 2>Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for each audience communicating to a </v>

385
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Speaker 2>woman if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

386
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.513
<v Speaker 2>if you just speak to a woman who wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn for self defense and to defend </v>

387
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:11.004
<v Speaker 2>against sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu in the conventional sense that </v>

388
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conventional way that 99% of schools</v>

389
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:16.524
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers are too and you were to have </v>

390
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>her come in and just try a beginner </v>
<v Speaker 2>class at a school,</v>

391
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.203
<v Speaker 2>she would see no immediate and direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>application between the grappling idea </v>

392
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.084
<v Speaker 2>of two people sweating on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling around on the Mat and the </v>

393
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>potential for defend against sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault.</v>

394
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.630
<v Speaker 2>She would not see that connect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is there a connection?</v>

395
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she would not see it.</v>

396
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.343
<v Speaker 2>So what we have literally done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>created adapters to make the same </v>

397
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:45.120
<v Speaker 2>principles communicatable to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

398
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>

399
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 2>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that makes them say,</v>

400
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not only effective for me.</v>

401
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.053
<v Speaker 2>This was designed exclusively for me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you communicated that perfectly to </v>

402
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 2>a fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidated,</v>

403
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 2>uncertain beginner students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you captivate,</v>

404
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:04.920
<v Speaker 2>then you engage them in the art too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would other have not wise happened?</v>

405
00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:05.754
<v Speaker 2>Because you know if you speak to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the normal communication language </v>

406
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 2>of Jujitsu and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

407
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.930
<v Speaker 2>this is really kind of actually kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem very fun,</v>

408
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see how I would use this</v>

409
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 2>in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to dismiss Jujitsu after her</v>

410
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 2>first class and I say her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

411
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I even mean men who go to a class and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are just not tough mma want to.</v>

412
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.903
<v Speaker 2>We've got fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just normal civilians and they </v>

413
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 2>come into a class and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

414
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 2>this is freaking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing here.</v>

415
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.273
<v Speaker 2>It can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely quite as all boils down to </v>

416
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 2>how it's communicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the answer is yes,</v>

417
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone needs your Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone can benefit from Jujitsu,</v>

418
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but if you communicate it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a disaster.</v>

419
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.353
<v Speaker 2>This even even course to course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even within the beginner Gracie </v>

420
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:46.860
<v Speaker 2>combatives course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have three new people on their first</v>

421
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

422
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Even those three have to be communicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>to differently.</v>

423
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 2>That's how special is that 225 pound kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just came out of college,</v>

424
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:54.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing football for three years in </v>

425
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:56.124
<v Speaker 2>college and now you have somebody who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who works at Bank of America down the </v>

426
00:19:58.981 --> 00:19:59.814
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are two different people in the </v>

427
00:20:01.681 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 2>same class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps energies.</v>

428
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 2>How are you making these individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluations?</v>

429
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.680
<v Speaker 2>What signs are you reading of how a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person needs to be taught and embraced?</v>

430
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:13.974
<v Speaker 2>What are things that are conveying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already know everything we need to </v>

431
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:17.504
<v Speaker 2>know from the handshake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment just from that we already </v>

432
00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:22.140
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already know that.</v>

433
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.980
<v Speaker 2>We all want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me then from that,</v>

434
00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 2>what is from that so tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person to accept.</v>

435
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.033
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

436
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from that highly energized,</v>

437
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.533
<v Speaker 2>overly eccentric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially an actor and a comedian of </v>

438
00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 2>sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're coming here,</v>

439
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you're excited to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're very nervous.</v>

440
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

441
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're excited to be here.</v>

442
00:20:41.771 --> 00:20:43.780
<v Speaker 2>You've been waiting to learn this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire life.</v>

443
00:20:43.781 --> 00:20:45.850
<v Speaker 2>So you're like getting more your </v>
<v Speaker 2>information over.</v>

444
00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's give it to this guy cause he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it right now.</v>

445
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 2>At the same time we can't be too excited</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's also a very strong,</v>

446
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 2>you can tell from his hands [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands,</v>

447
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 2>my hands a little sore from that right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

448
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.933
<v Speaker 2>So quite tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we're too excited it might make </v>

449
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 2>him a low too excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won't relax.</v>

450
00:20:59.130 --> 00:20:59.963
<v Speaker 2>Rush to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're experiencing with </v>

451
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you is that no matter how gently we </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach you the moves,</v>

452
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you're over committing to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>execution.</v>

453
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.003
<v Speaker 2>So our talk to you on the Mat as you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed has to have been overly </v>

454
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:09.844
<v Speaker 2>compensating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

455
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Hey Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this and we whispered,</v>

456
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 2>you drink class and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

457
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:17.670
<v Speaker 2>why are they still relaxed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hope they'll try to bring you down.</v>

458
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.563
<v Speaker 2>We hope that your movements will match </v>
<v Speaker 2>our whisper and then you'll become the </v>

459
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu whisper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you learn those things?</v>

460
00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:26.454
<v Speaker 2>Which these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are psychological and amphora per </v>

461
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.500
<v Speaker 2>logical skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are not the,</v>

462
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.040
<v Speaker 2>they obviously clearly intersect with </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

463
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>So when you're little kids with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and your uncles,</v>

464
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:41.520
<v Speaker 2>and we'll have a family members were </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant,</v>

465
00:21:41.521 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 2>then how are you?</v>

466
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.110
<v Speaker 2>You being taught this stuff at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time as you're being taught.</v>

467
00:21:46.111 --> 00:21:46.944
<v Speaker 2>This is how to do a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our grandfather always talked about how </v>

468
00:21:49.681 --> 00:21:50.514
<v Speaker 2>whenever he touches someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start getting weak and he has this </v>

469
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:55.014
<v Speaker 2>energy about him in his aura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant was that if I put my </v>

470
00:21:58.111 --> 00:22:02.640
<v Speaker 2>hand on you and my hand is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how tense you are,</v>

471
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.773
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to take too long for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to also relax versus if I grab you </v>

472
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.530
<v Speaker 2>squeezing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to make you 10 so when you're</v>

473
00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:14.040
<v Speaker 2>fighting somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to our benefit to fight somebody,</v>

474
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:19.041
<v Speaker 2>but find every moment we can to relax so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can bring their energy down.</v>

475
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.210
<v Speaker 2>We can calm them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them feel safe and calm down.</v>

476
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Saint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a student like Russell,</v>

477
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:26.940
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about and we're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opponent wants to kill you.</v>

478
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about it and how we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how we teach him the fight.</v>

479
00:22:30.121 --> 00:22:31.080
<v Speaker 2>You're hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy.</v>

480
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm soft to make him relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where I'm fighting somebody,</v>

481
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I relax to make them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

482
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.600
<v Speaker 2>and then block he slices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to answer your question,</v>

483
00:22:39.601 --> 00:22:40.434
<v Speaker 2>let's get back on the anthropological </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the connection and the </v>

484
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.293
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about this idea of where are </v>

485
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:50.550
<v Speaker 2>we learn how to teach and connect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's be clear that the world knows</v>

486
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:54.680
<v Speaker 2>the Gracie family as a fighting family </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a hundred years is 1920 oh you know,</v>

487
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.523
<v Speaker 2>it's almost a hundred years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the world kind of seeds on </v>

488
00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:59.550
<v Speaker 2>the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we don't feel that way at all.</v>

489
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.450
<v Speaker 2>We feel that we're part of a teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>family for three generations,</v>

490
00:23:03.451 --> 00:23:06.780
<v Speaker 2>almost a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as much refinement,</v>

491
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.950
<v Speaker 2>dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsession that has been dedicated to the</v>

492
00:23:10.951 --> 00:23:13.080
<v Speaker 2>process of choking out other human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

493
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.510
<v Speaker 2>That's been a very obsessive process for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 100 years.</v>

494
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.673
<v Speaker 2>As much as we've spent on that process </v>
<v Speaker 2>in equal amount of time and energy has </v>

495
00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:25.161
<v Speaker 2>been spent on refining the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer our skill set to other people,</v>

496
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% as much as you're saying,</v>

497
00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I'll get right into the crook of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>

498
00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:31.854
<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying this is the best way to </v>

499
00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:34.164
<v Speaker 2>come in and you're 100% and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are at the forefront of certifying </v>

500
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.183
<v Speaker 2>other instructors around the world to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same things that we're doing and we </v>

501
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:45.030
<v Speaker 2>have 150 schools today who are all </v>
<v Speaker 2>certified to teach.</v>

502
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.133
<v Speaker 2>These curriculums were telling you about</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the same techniques but </v>

503
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:50.084
<v Speaker 2>communicated in the same way and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same teaching methodology and that's an </v>

504
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.970
<v Speaker 2>obsession of ours as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting itself,</v>

505
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have made sense for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather,</v>

506
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncles,</v>

507
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:00.764
<v Speaker 2>cousins to choke everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these challenges of other martial </v>

508
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:04.694
<v Speaker 2>arts and to prove that Jujitsu was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best and not be ready to receive the </v>

509
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:10.124
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people that now want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn what they just proved to be </v>

510
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:13.994
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

511
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.253
<v Speaker 1>How was it to grow up as young men </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioning from childhood through </v>

512
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:20.744
<v Speaker 1>adolescence and puberty with the natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperatives to impress your masculinity </v>

513
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>and individuality on your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment when what goes before you?</v>

514
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Is there sort of a warrior class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

515
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Speaker 1>what was it like being teenage boys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you see?</v>

516
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Every day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I proved my warrior spirit on him.</v>

517
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you also,</v>

518
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.693
<v Speaker 2>I prove to my family and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my uncles and cousins and my </v>

519
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Speaker 2>grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I was a warrior by how much I could</v>

520
00:24:48.271 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 2>beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a young kid,</v>

521
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.780
<v Speaker 2>he did receive a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

522
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 2>but that was me trying to prove that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was warrior and now it was the big thing</v>

523
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:58.290
<v Speaker 2>because there's a little pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the age of 13,</v>

524
00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:00.510
<v Speaker 2>14 of wanting to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:25:00.511 --> 00:25:01.710
<v Speaker 2>what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

526
00:25:01.711 --> 00:25:02.790
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

528
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.310
<v Speaker 2>it's warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

529
00:25:05.311 --> 00:25:06.061
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

530
00:25:06.061 --> 00:25:06.894
<v Speaker 2>as time passes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we quickly realized that what they are </v>

531
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.180
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just warriors,</v>

532
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.060
<v Speaker 2>they're more than warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're here to help people in,</v>

533
00:25:15.061 --> 00:25:15.894
<v Speaker 2>to save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't necessarily see my uncles </v>

534
00:25:18.811 --> 00:25:19.644
<v Speaker 2>and my father as these fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw them as men that were making a </v>

535
00:25:23.101 --> 00:25:24.870
<v Speaker 2>difference in changing lives.</v>

536
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that aspect of it,</v>

537
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the sort of a social and compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect was you were aware of that?</v>

538
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite young.</v>

539
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that might've been even a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

540
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.613
<v Speaker 2>especially exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go down the route of fighting </v>

541
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an athlete in a fighter.</v>

542
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:40.874
<v Speaker 2>I went down the route of a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I was more influenced by the </v>

543
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.640
<v Speaker 2>teachers that were in the world in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

544
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.873
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although sort of the generation before </v>

545
00:25:49.601 --> 00:25:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

546
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world renowned fires.</v>

547
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

548
00:25:55.111 --> 00:25:55.944
<v Speaker 2>and they were also around teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were in a time where nobody </v>

549
00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:00.120
<v Speaker 2>believed that Jujitsu was</v>

550
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.440
<v Speaker 1>best martial art in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When hoists Gracie wins UFC one,</v>

551
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.600
<v Speaker 1>like in the interview straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

552
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.010
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

553
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about the money that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>owe $50,000.</v>

554
00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:12.360
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch it every day.</v>

555
00:26:12.361 --> 00:26:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to teaching.</v>

556
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what you'd like the end of last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

557
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

558
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.613
<v Speaker 1>so like it's clear that whilst there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the imperative to prove for presumably </v>

559
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:29.220
<v Speaker 1>for honor and for mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the efficiency of this martial art,</v>

560
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.050
<v Speaker 1>there is a sort of a dedication and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>devotion that's not just about glory,</v>

561
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 1>glamour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial thing.</v>

562
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a face you can fight for three </v>

563
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years,</v>

564
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.514
<v Speaker 2>12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can teach Jujitsu forever and </v>

565
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more rewarding than </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving people this,</v>

566
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Speaker 2>this magic Jujitsu is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes,</v>

567
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>took Ellie Gracie from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.760
<v Speaker 2>small hundred and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 pound frail man could,</v>

569
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do anything to the superhero of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

570
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>So this is magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're distributing magic.</v>

571
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Whoever wants it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're here to give it.</v>

572
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 2>And there are schools all around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world doing the same thing.</v>

573
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's no problem waking up,</v>

574
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 2>coming to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to work.</v>

575
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to show up and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>

576
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 2>You see how it is when you walk in here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of the reason why this</v>

577
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Speaker 2>concept of wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are,</v>

578
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.900
<v Speaker 2>there's just such a humility towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here to serve.</v>

579
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You're here to teach this and not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bask in the glory of winning UFC.</v>

580
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:25.080
<v Speaker 2>One white voice wasn't very ostentatious</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like you know,</v>

581
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you know too crazy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason why it's hard for</v>

582
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:30.474
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general population to understand </v>

583
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:32.484
<v Speaker 2>this is because the only other time they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever see fights or any type of major </v>

584
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:36.684
<v Speaker 2>competition happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's between two athletes have the same </v>

585
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.923
<v Speaker 2>skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a boxer against a boxer to </v>

586
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 2>boxers fight each other with the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs in boxing.</v>

587
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>One guy wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who won that match?</v>

588
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't boxing that won that match.</v>

589
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.083
<v Speaker 2>It was a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person who won the match between two </v>

590
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:55.344
<v Speaker 2>boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you have to understand what the </v>

591
00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:57.684
<v Speaker 2>hoist and even our grandfather in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>few challenge matches that we had of </v>

592
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 2>guys who didn't believe in Jujitsu is we</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't fighting.</v>

593
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu won UFC.</v>

594
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:08.454
<v Speaker 2>One hoists did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When UFC one Jujitsu won UFC one and it </v>

595
00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:15.534
<v Speaker 2>beat karate and it beats a vod and it'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat boxing and it beat these other </v>

596
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:19.681
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

597
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 2>It was more effective than all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

598
00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:22.204
<v Speaker 2>So they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very important understanding </v>

599
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:23.450
<v Speaker 2>because you can pull it</v>

600
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very significant to keep banging on</v>

601
00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:29.060
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is significant religious idea.</v>

602
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.953
<v Speaker 1>Most religions are built on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your individual identity is not as </v>

603
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 1>important as the ideology that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing your consciousness.</v>

604
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.190
<v Speaker 1>That if you slide and also surrender the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you surrender,</v>

605
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 1>that you are only a vessel</v>

606
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 2>for our grandfather is the 100% believed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't him who won any fights.</v>

607
00:28:51.671 --> 00:28:52.504
<v Speaker 2>It was Jujitsu hoist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see it after UFC one </v>

608
00:28:54.071 --> 00:28:56.800
<v Speaker 2>perpetuates this same conviction that </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen you guys,</v>

609
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

610
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>

611
00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.433
<v Speaker 2>but Jujitsu is what is special and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have other brothers who can do just as </v>

612
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.150
<v Speaker 2>well as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the only one.</v>

613
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a representative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

614
00:29:05.351 --> 00:29:06.184
<v Speaker 2>He very outspoken about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other brothers could have done what he </v>

615
00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:09.304
<v Speaker 2>did and he was chosen because him and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad had a good relationship and hoist </v>

616
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:13.930
<v Speaker 2>was one of the smaller members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

617
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.913
<v Speaker 2>So it was actually a more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of Jujitsu is </v>

618
00:29:17.361 --> 00:29:20.080
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness for someone smaller to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that vessel.</v>

619
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.330
<v Speaker 2>But absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

620
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it religion?</v>

621
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

622
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.200
<v Speaker 2>what that does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tells the whole world,</v>

623
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.843
<v Speaker 2>anybody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can jump on board and join this </v>

624
00:29:30.281 --> 00:29:31.730
<v Speaker 2>religion of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

625
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.893
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask a little more because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting moment in that first </v>

626
00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:37.130
<v Speaker 1>ufc where your father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

627
00:29:37.131 --> 00:29:42.131
<v Speaker 1>presents your grandfather with a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trophy to honor intense.</v>

628
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Your grandfather heard that the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very still intense.</v>

629
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:47.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even this image of him here that people </v>

630
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.643
<v Speaker 1>watching visually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see this is something he was </v>

631
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>emanate in some thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a kind of monk energy know,</v>

632
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.480
<v Speaker 1>like what was he like as a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

633
00:29:58.481 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's intense.</v>

634
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suppose some humility,</v>

635
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I listened to him when he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>this humility,</v>

636
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.473
<v Speaker 1>but this is a person that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some people that are swamis </v>

637
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.710
<v Speaker 1>priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

638
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a very sort of a peculiar energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the peculiar emanation.</v>

639
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

640
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

641
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I think present and unfazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to him,</v>

642
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 2>very few things actually mattered to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

643
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>

644
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

645
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 2>he didn't hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right here.</v>

646
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking to you.</v>

647
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 2>If he's teaching you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the world to him.</v>

648
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're,</v>

649
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.850
<v Speaker 2>if you do right by him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll do right by you,</v>

650
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Speaker 2>the most loyal guy you'll ever meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if not,</v>

651
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 2>he'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.820
<v Speaker 2>if you guys aren't together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not together.</v>

653
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>He's very all or nothing with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very real with him.</v>

654
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.560
<v Speaker 2>There was never any in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

655
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute and that moment you're </v>

656
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 2>talking about when he received the </v>
<v Speaker 2>award,</v>

657
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 2>he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

658
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.023
<v Speaker 2>whether he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was still in between Hawaii's </v>

659
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.890
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

660
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So he's still in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting that night.</v>

661
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.793
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is fighting his family's fine </v>

662
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's still ain't fight mode.</v>

663
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.313
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because remember he did this his whole </v>

664
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:09.821
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

665
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>bring in so many arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

666
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.423
<v Speaker 2>he can't quite be smiling yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still at least there's no </v>

667
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>celebration yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 2>How come that this award was given in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that context?</v>

669
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:19.774
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause this ufc one that's there in lies </v>

670
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:23.224
<v Speaker 2>the product of when the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the UFC basically can do </v>

671
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:28.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

672
00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:29.264
<v Speaker 2>So this is your father and my father is </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving an award to his soul is a little </v>

673
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

674
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 2>how do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

675
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:35.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

677
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:36.784
<v Speaker 2>my dad was holding all the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He created the show and he wanted to </v>

678
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 2>honor someone and he believed that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the original ultimate fighter.</v>

679
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And without him there would be no UFC.</v>

680
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.573
<v Speaker 2>So as the creator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to do whatever you want </v>

681
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:48.670
<v Speaker 2>of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to do whatever you want.</v>

682
00:31:48.671 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 2>And to honor the guy who gave birth to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

683
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.990
<v Speaker 2>who gave birth to the ability to even </v>
<v Speaker 2>create this type of entity through which</v>

684
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 2>to communicate martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want.</v>

685
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:58.780
<v Speaker 2>He did what made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes only makes perfect sense to</v>

686
00:31:58.781 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 2>have this guy in the octagon at ufc one </v>
<v Speaker 2>receiving,</v>

687
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.280
<v Speaker 2>especially to everyone who knew that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're now,</v>

688
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>there are some people who booed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurrence.</v>

689
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I know because you just want to see more</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

690
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 2>You want to see more people wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this guy?</v>

691
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Why is he getting an award right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't care.</v>

692
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>We want to see more punches and mortar </v>
<v Speaker 2>beer and let's just get crazy right now.</v>

693
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.193
<v Speaker 2>So there was that audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anybody who knew the origin of </v>

694
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that UFC gracie family there,</v>

695
00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're enjoying the UFC,</v>

696
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank him today.</v>

697
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Even today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank him.</v>

698
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And thank our father hardy on Gracie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank every Gracie who's ever fun,</v>

699
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:32.800
<v Speaker 2>put their neck on the line against other</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts to get it to the point where it can</v>

700
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 2>be this spectacle on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

701
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.840
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about how the UFC has </v>
<v Speaker 1>permutate it?</v>

702
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.930
<v Speaker 1>He seems to me like at the FCA is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a huge spectacle and a,</v>

703
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 1>it's usually successful and must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating a lot of revenue.</v>

704
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>But from a person that's doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much about it,</v>

705
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 1>it seems that why he's had to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do that is to let go of many of</v>

706
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 1>their principles of its foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

707
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:56.204
<v Speaker 1>to align itself as many sports have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the principles of consumer </v>

708
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 1>capitalism in order that it can be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>

709
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is that?</v>

710
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you just said is what we </v>

711
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel that Jujitsu or the UFC began as</v>

712
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 2>something that was exclusively designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make no mistake about it as a vehicle to</v>

713
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:15.404
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate the effectiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiority of some arts and the </v>

714
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 2>insufficiencies of up and deficiencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>of other arts.</v>

715
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason he was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceived.</v>

716
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It was just to show the difference of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different martial arts and it served its</v>

717
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:31.220
<v Speaker 2>purpose after UFC four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

718
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:32.390
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in that pocket,</v>

719
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.351
<v Speaker 2>everyone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

720
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:35.630
<v Speaker 2>that little Brazilian guy wrapped up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the white pajamas,</v>

721
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

722
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy in a tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch,</v>

723
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.584
<v Speaker 2>he's this little skinny guys going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you started becoming where you </v>

724
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:42.314
<v Speaker 2>knew the outcome before it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu had made it to America and to </v>

725
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.064
<v Speaker 2>the world and mission accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it from an education </v>

726
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.034
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then since then things started </v>

727
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:51.770
<v Speaker 2>changing on the production side.</v>

728
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.603
<v Speaker 2>They started adding time limits and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and weight classes and they </v>

729
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 2>modified the format so much so to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it more friendly for television and then</v>

730
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 2>eventually thanks to Dana White and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertitta brothers,</v>

731
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.560
<v Speaker 2>they made it a sanctioned sport where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people collapse.</v>

732
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be four.</v>

733
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 2>It was just a fight on TV and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became a sanctioned sport,</v>

734
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:09.403
<v Speaker 2>which even though that was very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the origins of what we were </v>

735
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 2>trying to do with the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by we,</v>

736
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean our father and our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

737
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.123
<v Speaker 2>even though it was against that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was absolutely necessary for it to </v>

738
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:20.054
<v Speaker 2>stick around because it was running into</v>
<v Speaker 2>some political pressure that it was </v>

739
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:22.844
<v Speaker 2>going to get pretty much terminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely if it didn't make the </v>

740
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 2>adaptations necessary to grow to what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has today.</v>

741
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.813
<v Speaker 2>And we benefit immensely from its </v>
<v Speaker 2>current popularity today because </v>

742
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu's main exposure to the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

743
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:35.660
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

744
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 2>through the means of UFC fight where one</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy does a choke hold that you know,</v>

745
00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:40.550
<v Speaker 2>ruined if a chocolate or a triangle </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke,</v>

746
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 2>which is now a household name because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>

747
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of viewers worldwide.</v>

749
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:47.223
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say that the UFC today doesn't </v>

750
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:53.741
<v Speaker 2>allow Jujitsu the way as you gracie </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice use two to be demonstrated.</v>

751
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 2>It's tougher because of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have rounds.</v>

752
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:57.764
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't allow you to let your </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent exhaust and burn energy while </v>

753
00:35:00.951 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you're conserving energy forces a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of you to push the pace.</v>

754
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.083
<v Speaker 2>So it's not quite the safest Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet there are still many amazing </v>

755
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:12.300
<v Speaker 2>examples of Jujitsu and being done at </v>
<v Speaker 2>principals being performed.</v>

756
00:35:12.301 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I remember the boxing example how when </v>
<v Speaker 2>two boxers fight,</v>

757
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.493
<v Speaker 2>boxing doesn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person wins today in the UFC when two </v>

758
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 2>guys fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

759
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have fighters here who will </v>

760
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 2>represent and fight in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are students of ours,</v>

761
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 2>who we have one is fighting right now in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few weeks.</v>

762
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

763
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.870
<v Speaker 2>and UFC two 22 and he goes into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he represents Jujitsu,</v>

764
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.713
<v Speaker 2>he does Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his opponent is a black belt in </v>

765
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he goes in there,</v>

766
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much Jujitsu one because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they both believe in Jujitsu.</v>

767
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.060
<v Speaker 2>So our students' application of Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his intelligence,</v>

768
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.933
<v Speaker 2>his approach to the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more intelligent and he may </v>

769
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:47.724
<v Speaker 2>prevail or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an individual who's going to </v>

770
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an art anymore.</v>

771
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.343
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what he was talking about is </v>

772
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.414
<v Speaker 2>now you have competitive athletes have </v>
<v Speaker 2>high athleticism and capabilities going </v>

773
00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 2>in their testing their individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes more so than the authenticity</v>

774
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.423
<v Speaker 2>or legitimacy of the art they practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause everyone's packed in the same </v>

775
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:05.470
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

776
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 2>so that argument has been won this </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrating.</v>

777
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So what I telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I know and other aspects of</v>

778
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:11.904
<v Speaker 2>this conversation I'm interested to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explore is you as men living in the </v>

779
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 2>ordinary world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

780
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:17.724
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it like for you if you find </v>

781
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:23.740
<v Speaker 2>yourself in a situation or physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict or if a physical fret,</v>

782
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.753
<v Speaker 2>a emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that like and tell us some </v>

783
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad x people love shit like that.</v>

784
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.963
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say that getting in a fight is </v>

785
00:36:34.121 --> 00:36:38.860
<v Speaker 2>easy and walking away it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess I kind of like that.</v>

786
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a good little light that line.</v>

787
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.170
<v Speaker 2>But getting in a fight is also easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're scared,</v>

788
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go crazy and just attack the person</v>

789
00:36:47.891 --> 00:36:49.990
<v Speaker 2>out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for us,</v>

790
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.000
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I walk around this world and</v>

791
00:36:55.001 --> 00:37:00.001
<v Speaker 2>I look at 99% of the people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>as sheep.</v>

792
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.980
<v Speaker 2>How do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

793
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of physical threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat to me,</v>

794
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 2>like they're all sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I,</v>

795
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.713
<v Speaker 2>if somebody happens to be cussing at me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a car honking at me and flipping me </v>

796
00:37:13.961 --> 00:37:18.100
<v Speaker 2>off or in line at a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this respect done.</v>

797
00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I look at that and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

798
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.940
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's zero of that.</v>

799
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to get my heart doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even race anymore.</v>

800
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:30.290
<v Speaker 2>What about a Disney world melon example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Disneyland.</v>

801
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I had a melon in my hand and as I walked</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the hotel,</v>

802
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>this man called me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

803
00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:38.530
<v Speaker 2>look at that guy carrying as melon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with my girlfriend,</v>

804
00:37:38.531 --> 00:37:39.610
<v Speaker 2>my wife now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

805
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 2>he said he must be a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had the melon,</v>

806
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he talking to me?</v>

807
00:37:44.861 --> 00:37:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>must be the only guy with a melon.</v>

808
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got an unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unusual accessory.</v>

809
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I looked and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

810
00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.530
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would he say that?</v>

811
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.603
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at the guy and he has two </v>

812
00:37:58.361 --> 00:38:00.250
<v Speaker 2>kids with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a seven and a nine year old.</v>

813
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.190
<v Speaker 2>And I just smiled and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

814
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

815
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.873
<v Speaker 2>But there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like you know what he's </v>

816
00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:09.940
<v Speaker 2>like and I was with my girlfriend.</v>

817
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.043
<v Speaker 2>Especially being with a woman you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like you want to defend your honor </v>

818
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 2>in front of her end up in Charlotte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough you are,</v>

819
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.763
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that he was five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven maybe the little easier to walk </v>

820
00:38:22.391 --> 00:38:24.070
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if he was six,</v>

821
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.890
<v Speaker 2>five and really big and a potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat.</v>

822
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.753
<v Speaker 2>I might've worn it to prove a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>more but then again I don't even think </v>

823
00:38:29.411 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have still look and said,</v>

824
00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:33.190
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is everything okay just to be clear.</v>

825
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he wants,</v>

826
00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:35.284
<v Speaker 2>if he really to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of have to give them the option </v>

827
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.883
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your confidence in this martial art as </v>

828
00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 2>moved you to a place where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumference of fear in much fervor,</v>

829
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.303
<v Speaker 2>way it would for you violence or </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation or combat is something </v>

830
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 2>that would only occur when absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

831
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Probably much more likely to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me because I was like like in the vote,</v>

832
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 2>like if something like that happens for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

833
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 2>panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

834
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration.</v>

835
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.633
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much they contribute to making a </v>

836
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:05.650
<v Speaker 2>street fight happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

837
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Right when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an argument between two people at</v>

838
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we know what we're yelling,</v>

839
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.310
<v Speaker 2>then there's pushing other punching in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their Friday.</v>

840
00:39:11.311 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're contributing.</v>

841
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.033
<v Speaker 2>We can either make it a fight or we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it a conversation that ends right </v>

842
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:19.504
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So knowing how to respond to somebody </v>

843
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.413
<v Speaker 2>that's pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took their parking spot or who's who </v>

844
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you ask them to look at their girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an inappropriate way,</v>

845
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 2>knowing how to speak to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means everything and how you speak to</v>

846
00:39:30.881 --> 00:39:31.714
<v Speaker 2>them stems from how you feel and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like everything's okay and that </v>

847
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be hurt and that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do get in a fight,</v>

848
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:39.544
<v Speaker 2>it will all be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to speak to a much </v>

849
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:41.290
<v Speaker 2>more code.</v>

850
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 2>If you don't feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't feel prepared to handle the</v>

851
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 2>physical altercation that might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to respond in fear and that</v>

852
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 2>fear is going to escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The combative energy between us,</v>

853
00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:56.130
<v Speaker 2>the way you have to look at it is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to imagine that between,</v>

854
00:39:56.131 --> 00:39:56.964
<v Speaker 2>and you don't deny there is a meter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he says either increases the </v>

855
00:40:01.511 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 2>combative energy or decreases it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

856
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:05.314
<v Speaker 2>There is no neutral increased or </v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased and everything I say is going </v>

857
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:08.944
<v Speaker 2>to increase or decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's what's interesting is that I </v>

858
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 2>can only reach the threshold that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to reach for the fight to actually</v>

859
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:16.720
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to reach a certain threshold,</v>

860
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.673
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen from a calm </v>

861
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 2>composed civil conversation unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's out to assault you and rob you</v>

862
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.594
<v Speaker 2>with their own intention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of the street fights that </v>

863
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 2>we typically think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is someone looks at,</v>

864
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:26.434
<v Speaker 2>someone goes like that and now I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight is on like that situation to </v>

865
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

866
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:29.943
<v Speaker 2>It has to reach a certain energy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he don't says when I come up and I </v>

867
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>bumped in or I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you do this?</v>

868
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:33.904
<v Speaker 2>Or why'd you look at her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the elder and I get excited and he </v>

869
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:36.484
<v Speaker 2>responds with equal excitement and fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and any energy that creates that </v>

870
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 2>escalation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once it hits the threshold,</v>

871
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:44.080
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to push someone and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to swing in.</v>

872
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 2>The fight is on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what we're saying is,</v>

873
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.773
<v Speaker 2>but knowing how to fight makes it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can respond to that initial </v>

874
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 2>stimulus so calmly that they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

875
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:53.014
<v Speaker 2>what's this guy guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys freaking guy partially </v>

876
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.520
<v Speaker 2>believe something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of believe there's,</v>

877
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.560
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing someone can do to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>me fight them other than attack me right</v>

878
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:03.304
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they had their hand on my </v>

879
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.361
<v Speaker 2>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

880
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know man.</v>

881
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Even then they're not attacking you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still talking to me.</v>

882
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't take that as an attack or as </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

883
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.630
<v Speaker 2>he put his hand on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it becomes a fight,</v>

884
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:14.464
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very few things you can do to </v>

885
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 2>make it a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is one throat punch?</v>

886
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.310
<v Speaker 2>It's it to go over a headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

887
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Anything other than punching me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to grab my whole body,</v>

888
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no fight going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me realize that in my own life,</v>

889
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>not even outside of the idea of physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>combat,</v>

890
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.013
<v Speaker 2>in the idea of just emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there will be no physical </v>

891
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.684
<v Speaker 2>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romantic relationships even or the </v>

892
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of putting the hand on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>

893
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm too easily triggered as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too busy looking for problem,</v>

894
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:45.021
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

895
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>fear like it's too much in my makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

896
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 2>like it's too much in my makeup.</v>

897
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

898
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

899
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.660
<v Speaker 2>local example before we drop deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

900
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about what you told me the house of</v>

901
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Blues Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So little stories.</v>

902
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 2>My now wife then girlfriend were at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house of Blues over there in Anaheim.</v>

903
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 2>We were watching our friends also might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be amazing.</v>

904
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.873
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin dog crew and they're doing their </v>

905
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 2>music thing and I'm in there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great music and uh,</v>

906
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:13.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing with even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a semi crowded situation and </v>

907
00:42:15.321 --> 00:42:16.154
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy to my immediate right here</v>
<v Speaker 2>who basically created his own marsh pit </v>

908
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 2>by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by himself.</v>

909
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:24.870
<v Speaker 2>He's mushing alone cause just poor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor going gold.</v>

910
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And then bought me once and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

911
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a passive patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gentle guy.</v>

912
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And he bumps me again and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's having a good time.</v>

913
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 2>But it got to the point where you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to match with him,</v>

914
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 2>you want a match.</v>

915
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.853
<v Speaker 2>We got to the point where he was making </v>
<v Speaker 2>it unpleasant because I was not able to </v>

916
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:40.640
<v Speaker 2>focus on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

917
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:41.474
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the party.</v>

918
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we could just move.</v>

919
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 2>But then the problem is I would permit </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to continue his behavior,</v>

920
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 2>which would make it unpleasant for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around round him.</v>

921
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 2>So the conclusion was made that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be dealt with.</v>

922
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:54.830
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

923
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very noisy and I couldn't just say,</v>

924
00:42:57.681 --> 00:42:58.514
<v Speaker 2>excuse me sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

925
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 2>It would be two out of the Er.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to get his attention.</v>

926
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 2>So this might be the first time there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a necessary physical demonstration.</v>

927
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible?</v>

928
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Can you cover this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you,</v>

929
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I can say it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fascinating.</v>

930
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

931
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:10.801
<v Speaker 2>To Russell the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

932
00:43:10.801 --> 00:43:12.450
<v Speaker 2>so he's here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my machine.</v>

933
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.383
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man can tell you having a very good </v>

934
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:17.444
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not right here with you bumping </v>

935
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:19.724
<v Speaker 2>into me every second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we call him down and let's </v>

936
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:21.914
<v Speaker 2>continue to watch the music said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the significant aspects of </v>

937
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:25.191
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

938
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had to,</v>

939
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:28.214
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't yell at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I whispered to him like it was like </v>

940
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:30.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it was noisy,</v>

941
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:32.960
<v Speaker 2>like I was so close that I didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>

942
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.180
<v Speaker 2>So as you can see what I entered right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

943
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 2>it's one hand on the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that feel.</v>

944
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm the head of the tricep right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hand the triceps.</v>

945
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'll put me in the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

946
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Can't I'm too close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn in country.</v>

947
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.220
<v Speaker 2>The other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got you right here.</v>

948
00:43:45.221 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 2>We're in the clean shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>

949
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.390
<v Speaker 2>We got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

950
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 2>so we're already a have a tactical </v>
<v Speaker 2>position right here.</v>

951
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I've safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this right here sends a message.</v>

952
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 2>What does it says?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Control.</v>

953
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've animals.</v>

954
00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Like when you put a puppy in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I don't put puppies in my mouth.</v>

955
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.073
<v Speaker 2>When your mum was a puppy in its mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that sending a very old message </v>

956
00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.713
<v Speaker 2>deep into the biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this brought him back to when he was </v>

957
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:09.660
<v Speaker 2>like for his dad would grab him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

958
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 2>don't call on the wall [inaudible] know </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your past,</v>

959
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but all we know is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen the guy absolutely still,</v>

960
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.123
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't even look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy is that he wasn't </v>

961
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:23.320
<v Speaker 2>even in a position to look at me like </v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

962
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.163
<v Speaker 2>this thumb right here has a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a pressure point of pass a field </v>

963
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just whispered this right here and</v>

964
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 2>he knew what he was doing cause he knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>he bumped into me already.</v>

965
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 2>So after I let go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

966
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 2>are we cool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

967
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.753
<v Speaker 2>Sounded like that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't move and he didn't match </v>

968
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>

969
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the mosh pit was done and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

970
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:42.323
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what I could have fought </v>

971
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:44.221
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

972
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I did assert myself a little bit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a situation where calm,</v>

973
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.100
<v Speaker 2>assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm,</v>

974
00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:50.934
<v Speaker 2>assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish many things because when you </v>

975
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:55.640
<v Speaker 2>can remain calm and put your hands on </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

976
00:44:55.641 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 2>if you have two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even in communication,</v>

977
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 2>let's say it was a totally not noisy </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

978
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

979
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 2>you're a behavior is getting a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control.</v>

980
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.543
<v Speaker 2>I don't appreciate it and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have you calm down a little bit </v>

981
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 2>and I can talk to him like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be calm and composed and direct with</v>

982
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People appreciate that and they go,</v>

983
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:14.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either he has a gun or he used the black</v>

984
00:45:14.561 --> 00:45:15.394
<v Speaker 2>vote at something or he knows something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you know that the ability to </v>

985
00:45:17.461 --> 00:45:19.030
<v Speaker 2>compose yourself that way comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu cause,</v>

986
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:20.380
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terror</v>

987
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.180
<v Speaker 1>trey off putting your hand on someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck and doing that.</v>

988
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's already Jujitsu master </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

989
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I would be,</v>

990
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.730
<v Speaker 1>if I was going to confront someone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of way,</v>

991
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.743
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a little too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that'd be a little too </v>

992
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:36.880
<v Speaker 1>aggressive to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you know,</v>

993
00:45:36.881 --> 00:45:37.970
<v Speaker 1>like because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

994
00:45:37.971 --> 00:45:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I wouldn't be feeling very calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

995
00:45:40.191 --> 00:45:41.840
<v Speaker 1>It's good to know that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did was,</v>

996
00:45:41.841 --> 00:45:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you spoke quietly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did something that was controlling.</v>

997
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I think for most people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>novices,</v>

998
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the kind of situation is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when someone direct</v>

999
00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.183
<v Speaker 2>c'mon front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would just have an attitude with </v>

1000
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:52.711
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 2>and you know what we say is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1002
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Egos and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99.9%</v>

1003
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:00.444
<v Speaker 2>of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>altercations that happened today would </v>

1004
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:03.744
<v Speaker 2>be completely nonexistent if you remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>the egos and the alcohol from the </v>

1005
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1006
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken the alcohol out,</v>

1007
00:46:10.691 --> 00:46:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but in the ego's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you said that on the front door,</v>

1008
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:15.040
<v Speaker 1>the door mat here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

1009
00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:17.860
<v Speaker 1>leave your ego here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that?</v>

1010
00:46:17.861 --> 00:46:19.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

1011
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.160
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1012
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.993
<v Speaker 2>you're the funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to prove to everybody that </v>

1013
00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:25.190
<v Speaker 2>you're the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

1014
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this the proving ground in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways they want to,</v>

1015
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to be the best on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat.</v>

1016
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.540
<v Speaker 2>So don't worry about being the best you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1017
00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Try to execute proper technique and </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeat each other.</v>

1018
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.250
<v Speaker 2>But this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1019
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you're greater than everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's funny about that,</v>

1020
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Matt though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it says,</v>

1021
00:46:40.121 --> 00:46:42.070
<v Speaker 2>leave your ego at the door as if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a choice.</v>

1022
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy as shit.</v>

1023
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.933
<v Speaker 2>It should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick your ego up right here when you </v>

1024
00:46:46.481 --> 00:46:47.740
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it should say.</v>

1025
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's just not coming in with you</v>

1026
00:46:50.081 --> 00:46:52.090
<v Speaker 2>because whoever comes in with the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what happens?</v>

1027
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It gets taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it gets taken out of you,</v>

1028
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.640
<v Speaker 2>if you can let your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1029
00:46:57.641 --> 00:46:58.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1030
00:46:58.031 --> 00:47:00.130
<v Speaker 2>my point is even when you come in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your first class,</v>

1031
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:00.881
<v Speaker 2>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Russell,</v>

1032
00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:02.080
<v Speaker 2>how would you escape this position?</v>

1033
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1034
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we say,</v>

1035
00:47:05.291 --> 00:47:06.124
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try this and you go about it as much </v>

1036
00:47:06.701 --> 00:47:07.534
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had to let go of the fact that </v>

1037
00:47:08.681 --> 00:47:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you had the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to learn the new answer,</v>

1038
00:47:10.331 --> 00:47:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you have to empty the cup to fill it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back up again.</v>

1039
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.173
<v Speaker 2>So when someone comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they get into the class and they </v>

1040
00:47:15.581 --> 00:47:16.414
<v Speaker 2>don't want to accept the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the answer for a particular </v>

1041
00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:20.890
<v Speaker 2>threat scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't learn the new answer and they</v>

1042
00:47:20.891 --> 00:47:22.750
<v Speaker 2>typically will leave before they ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1043
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.230
<v Speaker 2>So the students who stick around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them have to detach themselves to</v>

1044
00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:27.064
<v Speaker 2>some degree from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A preexisting egos otherwise won't even </v>

1045
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>make it in the building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one small thing and speaking night,</v>

1046
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>egos and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea when somebody confronts you in</v>

1047
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1048
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Just very natural nail and the words are</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange and looks when you know,</v>

1049
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:41.974
<v Speaker 2>if you want to avoid a fight in a heated</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment like that where there's words </v>

1050
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.124
<v Speaker 2>being exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what you have to do in that </v>

1051
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1052
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:52.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be okay saying to whoever it</v>

1053
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:54.730
<v Speaker 2>is that you're arguing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

1054
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I crossed the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake.</v>

1055
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you're angry at somebody.</v>

1056
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1057
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you want to fight me when I say,</v>

1058
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:04.654
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1059
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1060
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I crossed the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to move back.</v>

1061
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start Defense.</v>

1062
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:12.580
<v Speaker 2>If we instead feel like it may be I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1063
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.473
<v Speaker 2>I can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have said that and I was </v>

1064
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 2>here first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of attitude.</v>

1065
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no point.</v>

1066
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:18.724
<v Speaker 2>It's going to lead to a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're willing to do whatever it takes </v>

1067
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 2>not to fight and there's good reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why you guys listen via avoidance of the</v>

1068
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:26.764
<v Speaker 2>fight is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for our viewers and </v>

1069
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 2>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the avoidance of a street fight,</v>

1070
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 2>even one that might seem absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>eminent,</v>

1071
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.473
<v Speaker 2>it's unavoidable is the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>selfdefence tip you'll ever learn in </v>

1072
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

1073
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.473
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in a street fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering when I was in seventh </v>

1074
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:44.530
<v Speaker 2>grade and that was the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 1213 years old.</v>

1075
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the last fight I've ever been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my size.</v>

1076
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of a diffusing situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is this,</v>

1077
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.400
<v Speaker 2>the street fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the street fight that you win,</v>

1078
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.830
<v Speaker 2>you often lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because think about this,</v>

1079
00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you get into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fall down,</v>

1080
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you know you take someone down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your elbow hits the ground,</v>

1081
00:48:58.761 --> 00:48:59.594
<v Speaker 2>you get stitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go to the hospital after you </v>

1082
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 2>get an infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staph infection and you won the fight.</v>

1083
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:03.454
<v Speaker 2>Let's you say you won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or let's say for our friends who don't </v>

1084
00:49:05.541 --> 00:49:06.920
<v Speaker 2>know Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get into a street fight,</v>

1085
00:49:06.921 --> 00:49:08.000
<v Speaker 2>someone pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you puff up,</v>

1086
00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:08.834
<v Speaker 2>they puff up your profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you swing and you crack them and you </v>

1087
00:49:10.401 --> 00:49:12.920
<v Speaker 2>chipped her tooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now you have a $20,000</v>

1088
00:49:12.921 --> 00:49:14.600
<v Speaker 2>dental bill on your hands.</v>

1089
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Because we live in a litigious society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So self defense doesn't just mean how to</v>

1090
00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:22.790
<v Speaker 2>avoid getting knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Defense means self preservation,</v>

1091
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.240
<v Speaker 2>preservation of your finances so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get sued.</v>

1092
00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.253
<v Speaker 2>Preservation of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get in this fight and you get </v>

1093
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:29.943
<v Speaker 2>beneath someone and you're in the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the guard and let's say they have a </v>

1094
00:49:31.941 --> 00:49:35.480
<v Speaker 2>bloody nose cause you hit him on the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and now they're bleeding on you.</v>

1095
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.373
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there is blood borne diseases </v>

1096
00:49:38.091 --> 00:49:38.924
<v Speaker 2>are transferred sexually transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases and the blood born illnesses </v>

1097
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:42.223
<v Speaker 2>that can be transferred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want someone bleeding on </v>

1098
00:49:43.281 --> 00:49:44.114
<v Speaker 2>you in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid anything that has to </v>

1099
00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:48.860
<v Speaker 2>do with the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea of don't fight because it's</v>

1100
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:49.694
<v Speaker 2>the right thing you did know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fight because it's a stupid thing </v>

1101
00:49:51.351 --> 00:49:53.340
<v Speaker 2>to fight if you can avoid it.</v>

1102
00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Any costs you want to avoid a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like too many people thinking</v>

1103
00:49:57.671 --> 00:49:58.504
<v Speaker 2>about self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the ability to win the </v>

1104
00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the ability to avoid it altogether.</v>

1105
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to overcome that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in quite a Marshall Society.</v>

1106
00:50:04.851 --> 00:50:05.684
<v Speaker 2>We live in a city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take the example of what's </v>

1107
00:50:06.831 --> 00:50:07.664
<v Speaker 2>happening in UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that started as a </v>

1108
00:50:09.771 --> 00:50:10.604
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of the efficacy of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular Marsha are in universal or </v>

1109
00:50:14.241 --> 00:50:15.074
<v Speaker 2>open conditions became controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And regulated for the purposes of </v>

1110
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.890
<v Speaker 2>commercial purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me it as well.</v>

1111
00:50:21.891 --> 00:50:22.724
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that I'm learning for us </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my early experiences of Brazilian </v>

1112
00:50:24.831 --> 00:50:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about very much awareness.</v>

1113
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1114
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 1>about having an awareness of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>

1115
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1116
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get into confrontations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an awareness of the prison.</v>

1117
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.340
<v Speaker 1>While I'm listening to the two of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

1118
00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm continually thinking these are </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal principles.</v>

1119
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>These are applicable outside of the art </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jujitsu,</v>

1120
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 1>an outside of combat that when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching my work,</v>

1121
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>when I'm approaching my relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in the moment,</v>

1122
00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 1>think I'm with this woman for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

1123
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:54.434
<v Speaker 1>So why do I want to have a big argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I say something damaging or with </v>

1124
00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:58.574
<v Speaker 1>my child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a relationship with last river </v>

1125
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in a sense,</v>

1126
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like the combat and conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is so vivid.</v>

1127
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.553
<v Speaker 1>It's more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes certain principals more </v>

1128
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also applicable in all communication.</v>

1129
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Because I suppose as we've said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a language.</v>

1130
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1131
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.560
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a form of communication.</v>

1132
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:19.394
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've noticed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of you and even that demonstration </v>

1133
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.083
<v Speaker 1>is that's a communications expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's someone who knows how to </v>

1134
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 1>communicate in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very expert way.</v>

1135
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:30.043
<v Speaker 1>And possibly the reason you've not had </v>
<v Speaker 1>any street fights is because for the </v>

1136
00:51:32.301 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years you've been neck cramping </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1137
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I leave my house,</v>

1138
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I only did that one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will say this,</v>

1139
00:51:39.031 --> 00:51:40.920
<v Speaker 2>we go to the principal's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're referencing a,</v>

1140
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:41.803
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful because you know we talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about self defense and fight and not </v>

1141
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.413
<v Speaker 2>fight and egos and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's crazy is that for every one </v>

1142
00:51:49.681 --> 00:51:51.720
<v Speaker 2>time that I've ever had the touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1143
00:51:51.721 --> 00:51:54.360
<v Speaker 2>there's that blue's house of blues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the one in seventh grade.</v>

1144
00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.093
<v Speaker 2>I have applied shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute core Jujitsu principles on the </v>

1145
00:52:00.991 --> 00:52:01.824
<v Speaker 2>business front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the personal front a thousand times </v>

1146
00:52:05.131 --> 00:52:05.964
<v Speaker 2>to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's an example of the welcome to the </v>

1147
00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:09.151
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

1148
00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many do we have time for?</v>

1149
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So this is what's so beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's crazy Russell,</v>

1150
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.620
<v Speaker 2>is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true for our lives.</v>

1151
00:52:16.621 --> 00:52:17.454
<v Speaker 2>100% Jujitsu is life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is your Jitsu because these </v>

1152
00:52:19.441 --> 00:52:20.274
<v Speaker 2>principles are universal that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to demonstrate or combat </v>

1153
00:52:21.841 --> 00:52:22.674
<v Speaker 2>principles.</v>

1154
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.540
<v Speaker 2>There are 17 noncombat principles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply to,</v>

1155
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:26.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everyday life into business and </v>

1156
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.020
<v Speaker 2>relationships and we'll talk about a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we have time for it.</v>

1157
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.363
<v Speaker 2>But here's what's crazy is that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>students who train with us start for </v>

1158
00:52:35.971 --> 00:52:36.804
<v Speaker 2>self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they stick for the life application </v>

1159
00:52:40.831 --> 00:52:41.664
<v Speaker 2>of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're learning here that once you've </v>

1160
00:52:42.781 --> 00:52:44.190
<v Speaker 2>trained for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including you,</v>

1161
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:44.911
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1162
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:45.744
<v Speaker 2>seven months of good Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never need to train again for </v>

1163
00:52:47.371 --> 00:52:49.170
<v Speaker 2>self defense reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be okay.</v>

1164
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.183
<v Speaker 2>You'll know how to manage distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how to avoid getting knocked </v>

1165
00:52:51.541 --> 00:52:52.374
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You at least won't go to the hospital </v>

1166
00:52:53.281 --> 00:52:54.630
<v Speaker 2>and you're good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need for a fight.</v>

1167
00:52:54.631 --> 00:52:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Just don't get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have that ability in a few months</v>

1168
00:52:57.031 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 2>with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then why keep training for 16 years?</v>

1169
00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Because every single day you come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>

1170
00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you're reinforcing principles that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to demonstrate right now.</v>

1171
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.730
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got on the floor and now we're here.</v>

1172
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to be safe.</v>

1173
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll call commentary because our friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home who are listening to this,</v>

1174
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:16.163
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do the best we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just demonstrate one here </v>

1175
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.310
<v Speaker 2>called position before submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Critical principle,</v>

1176
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the right move at the wrong time is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong move.</v>

1177
00:53:23.131 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 2>He don't as right now mounted on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the mountains you do to both</v>

1178
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:26.634
<v Speaker 2>knees over my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what amazing submission from right </v>

1179
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:29.274
<v Speaker 2>here is he pins the arm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He locks his elbow and he goes under my </v>

1180
00:53:32.131 --> 00:53:33.480
<v Speaker 2>arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabs my own risks.</v>

1181
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 2>And this is called the Americana arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>lock.</v>

1182
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>All yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you right now and slide my hand down</v>

1183
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:38.843
<v Speaker 2>and my shoulder will dislocate right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and I'll be in excruciating pain </v>

1184
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 2>and I'll either tap or scream fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1185
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 2>He wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americana arm lock,</v>

1186
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:46.943
<v Speaker 2>great technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was that principle and notch </v>

1187
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:51.270
<v Speaker 2>position before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's mounted on me.</v>

1188
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Go on my guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He don't?</v>

1189
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he don't get to go inside my guard.</v>

1190
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It's called the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inside my laser.</v>

1191
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.663
<v Speaker 2>Very common position in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do the exact same </v>

1192
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but watch her dive on it.</v>

1193
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 2>He don't drive on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch what happens</v>

1194
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.220
<v Speaker 3>and now it's like,</v>

1195
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.113
<v Speaker 2>so why the exact same technique was </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely useless and not only useless </v>

1196
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 2>but actually dangerous for him using the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique from a different position.</v>

1197
00:54:15.881 --> 00:54:17.980
<v Speaker 2>So as he dives across and go American </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm lock,</v>

1198
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.120
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks correct,</v>

1199
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.310
<v Speaker 2>hand grabs his other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go under.</v>

1200
00:54:21.311 --> 00:54:22.144
<v Speaker 2>The problem is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do the Americana from within </v>

1201
00:54:24.281 --> 00:54:25.570
<v Speaker 2>someone's legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock it up,</v>

1202
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:26.583
<v Speaker 2>they can create an angle on you shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>this leg through and they can get up on </v>

1203
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:31.840
<v Speaker 2>your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because my legs are around,</v>

1204
00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:32.674
<v Speaker 2>heat owns body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have control of the position even </v>

1205
00:54:34.931 --> 00:54:36.610
<v Speaker 2>though he's applying the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>

1206
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.820
<v Speaker 2>So the question then becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are the implications for this?</v>

1207
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:40.960
<v Speaker 2>You can join us down here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a seat there.</v>

1208
00:54:40.961 --> 00:54:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And so the question becomes what is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual show boomers down here?</v>

1209
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.070
<v Speaker 2>The question becomes what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication of this in a,</v>

1210
00:54:48.071 --> 00:54:52.270
<v Speaker 2>in an off the mat sense position before </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission,</v>

1211
00:54:52.271 --> 00:54:56.920
<v Speaker 2>the right move from within the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>position is the wrong move.</v>

1212
00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.813
<v Speaker 2>So let's just say that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>product or you have a service or a plan </v>

1213
00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:02.164
<v Speaker 2>of action or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're offering your product to the </v>

1214
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.134
<v Speaker 2>marketplace and is not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say something you're really </v>

1215
00:55:06.971 --> 00:55:07.804
<v Speaker 2>passionate about though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're extremely believing in this </v>

1216
00:55:09.341 --> 00:55:10.174
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is your American arm lock and it's </v>

1217
00:55:11.801 --> 00:55:15.400
<v Speaker 2>not doing well in the marketplace where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to reflect on and say,</v>

1218
00:55:15.401 --> 00:55:16.234
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the Americana is something that I </v>

1219
00:55:17.831 --> 00:55:20.140
<v Speaker 2>know I'm supposed to be doing and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be selling,</v>

1220
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.300
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it succeeding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

1221
00:55:22.301 --> 00:55:26.290
<v Speaker 2>are you in the right position?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you selling it for the right price?</v>

1222
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:27.363
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you offering it to the right market </v>

1223
00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:30.430
<v Speaker 2>demographic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

1224
00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:34.270
<v Speaker 2>are you highlighting the correct and </v>
<v Speaker 2>most beneficial,</v>

1225
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits or properties of the product or</v>

1226
00:55:37.031 --> 00:55:37.864
<v Speaker 2>service?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to make sure it has the most </v>

1227
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:40.083
<v Speaker 2>effective penetration in the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and how he did it for the right </v>

1228
00:55:42.101 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the principle of service.</v>

1229
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing this to create common </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone?</v>

1230
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Is your position correct on what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering or servicing?</v>

1231
00:55:50.231 --> 00:55:51.064
<v Speaker 2>So this is the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transposition position before </v>

1232
00:55:53.261 --> 00:55:55.270
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can have the best American if you</v>

1233
00:55:55.271 --> 00:55:56.440
<v Speaker 2>do it from the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

1234
00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.060
<v Speaker 2>If you do it from the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win the fight.</v>

1235
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.983
<v Speaker 2>Same Americana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different application position and it's </v>

1236
00:56:01.061 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 2>completely different effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is what's your Americana in</v>

1237
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:07.720
<v Speaker 2>your life and are you operating from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right principal and the right position?</v>

1238
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Failing forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get me in the guard.</v>

1239
00:56:10.071 --> 00:56:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You going to do an arm lock right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check this out you guys.</v>

1240
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.843
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1241
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:16.723
<v Speaker 2>the question is in the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful technique for he don't and we </v>

1242
00:56:19.341 --> 00:56:20.174
<v Speaker 2>talked about how before you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should not go for the Americana cause </v>

1243
00:56:21.891 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 2>he can take my back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but flip the script.</v>

1244
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:24.544
<v Speaker 2>Now what can he do from the guard that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so amazing if I'm strangling him or </v>

1245
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 2>choking him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he creates an angle.</v>

1246
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 2>His legs fly up and he breaks my elbow </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

1247
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:31.804
<v Speaker 2>He's holding my wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hyper extending my elbow with his </v>

1248
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 2>hips and I either tap or snap right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1249
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a done deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful technique.</v>

1250
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this principles called failing </v>

1251
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:41.800
<v Speaker 2>forward so you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for it,</v>

1252
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.420
<v Speaker 2>spinned for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch it.</v>

1253
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Look what happens every my arm out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then from here liquidy does.</v>

1254
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Then the fights over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened right there?</v>

1255
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I ripped my arm out of the arm bar.</v>

1256
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first glance,</v>

1257
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 2>you look at that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1258
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity was stripped away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and 99% of the world would see that</v>

1259
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 2>as a lost opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sees it as a perfect triangle set up.</v>

1260
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.750
<v Speaker 2>So don't you notice how in society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll show it one more time.</v>

1261
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll talk about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>application here.</v>

1262
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:11.050
<v Speaker 2>He makes an angle and breaks the arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

1263
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 2>When he's going for the arm lock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants my,</v>

1264
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm to stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I rip this arm out,</v>

1265
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:16.810
<v Speaker 2>he can't do that move anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the wrong arm.</v>

1266
00:57:16.811 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 2>Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try this.</v>

1267
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.300
<v Speaker 2>He can't break this arm because my arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>bends this way.</v>

1268
00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:20.134
<v Speaker 2>It's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this arm that he would have liked </v>

1269
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:22.570
<v Speaker 2>to had broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1270
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:23.613
<v Speaker 2>So from here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that fails and that's no longer </v>

1271
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:25.534
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this leg just comes around my neck and </v>

1272
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:28.384
<v Speaker 2>crosses around my neck and now put it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hip turn and I'm completely </v>

1273
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:32.704
<v Speaker 2>chalkable.</v>

1274
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.173
<v Speaker 2>Not just chalkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but specifically because I ripped this </v>

1275
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:38.704
<v Speaker 2>arm out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100% exposing myself to a better </v>

1276
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:41.734
<v Speaker 2>technique and the aftermath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before we ever apply this as an </v>

1277
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 2>fiddler philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as a combat position,</v>

1278
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 2>fasc incredible because you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line he had on his,</v>

1279
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 2>on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your back.</v>

1280
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.433
<v Speaker 2>But from care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the armbar being available is amazing </v>

1281
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.313
<v Speaker 2>because this is a technique that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned in the last few days were very </v>

1282
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:03.040
<v Speaker 2>beautiful technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then even if that arm is removed,</v>

1283
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:05.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscious enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're awake enough,</v>

1284
00:58:05.141 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 2>there is the opportunity to move the leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the other side of their head.</v>

1285
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And then you're just saying if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake it,</v>

1286
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:12.430
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity's there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared to seize it because think about</v>

1287
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter who you are,</v>

1288
00:58:13.571 --> 00:58:15.520
<v Speaker 2>what your profession is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your passion is,</v>

1289
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 2>what's your pursuit is you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have setbacks,</v>

1290
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be personal setbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

1291
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 2>your life circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happens,</v>

1292
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 2>throws you off your rail.</v>

1293
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be industry setbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say like the comedy industry takes</v>

1294
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:29.310
<v Speaker 2>a hit and no loans going to shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1295
00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.153
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu just takes a spike and then may </v>

1296
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:34.260
<v Speaker 2>have whatever there's gonna be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry set back and then there's going</v>

1297
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:35.094
<v Speaker 2>to be potentially a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society setback where there's an </v>

1298
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:39.064
<v Speaker 2>economic downfall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's on a crash and things are </v>

1299
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:42.634
<v Speaker 2>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't you notice how sometimes in </v>

1300
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:45.004
<v Speaker 2>the setbacks people losing suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always some superstars who </v>

1301
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 2>come out and they capitalize and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>win when everyone else is losing.</v>

1302
00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.213
<v Speaker 2>Don't you wonder what operating system </v>
<v Speaker 2>are they on that allows them to </v>

1303
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.204
<v Speaker 2>capitalize and grow to the extent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are when everyone else seems to be </v>

1304
00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 2>failing in the same environment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1305
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.153
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you are going for the arm bar and </v>

1306
00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:13.870
<v Speaker 2>an arm rips out and you're mourning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss of the arm bar,</v>

1307
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.980
<v Speaker 2>there is no ability to see the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that's there.</v>

1308
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So the key of this principle called </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing forward is</v>

1309
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 1>allow unfortunate circumstances to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

1310
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.720
<v Speaker 1>observed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but immediately once they happen,</v>

1311
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 1>know that they no longer exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1312
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:28.694
<v Speaker 1>that they're there and they move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now what you observe of the present </v>

1313
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 1>situation and what the opportunities are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

1314
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:34.724
<v Speaker 1>I've never caught a triangle that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe was there or would be </v>

1315
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:39.890
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone rips in our mouth,</v>

1316
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mourning the loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually expecting the triangle </v>

1317
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 1>that's going to come next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when opportunity meets preparation,</v>

1318
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:49.040
<v Speaker 1>amazing things will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge for most people is they're</v>

1319
00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:49.874
<v Speaker 1>not putting in the preparation time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is going well so that when </v>

1320
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>things go bad they can capitalize when </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is suffering from the loss</v>

1321
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.063
<v Speaker 1>and one so you'll mentality in life or </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mat is that when something could </v>

1322
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>appear to be a crisis that this is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an opportunity for you.</v>

1323
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1324
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.023
<v Speaker 1>I have to place this in a framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I understand it and I said to hit </v>

1325
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>on you have a day like in a standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy situation.</v>

1326
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:14.414
<v Speaker 1>If I'm in a good frame of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone shouts something from the </v>

1327
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is brilliant.</v>

1328
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 1>This is an opportunity for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be funny with that person.</v>

1329
01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm feeling nervous that night,</v>

1330
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:24.601
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1331
01:00:24.601 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's messing with my deal.</v>

1332
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>This is not how I wanted it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

1333
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>this is a spiritual principle of non </v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment.</v>

1334
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:31.634
<v Speaker 1>This is the principle of allowing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to be how it is and responding to </v>

1335
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:35.744
<v Speaker 1>it rather than thinking your personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>will is what's important now then you </v>

1336
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>see though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1337
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>her know that there is a continual hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I may,</v>

1338
01:00:43.721 --> 01:00:44.554
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there is a tension between</v>
<v Speaker 1>any principal of individual mastery and </v>

1339
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principal of sort of of surrender.</v>

1340
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:53.263
<v Speaker 1>How do you get into this position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise as martial artists and keep </v>

1341
01:00:57.501 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>yourself kind of grounded?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

1342
01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:05.501
<v Speaker 1>How do you not become yourself over </v>
<v Speaker 1>incensed by ego too.</v>

1343
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I want this to be the most successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

1344
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1345
01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>like how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is so much,</v>

1346
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin for me,</v>

1347
01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I have to watch myself from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1348
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>If I have a lot of things go right for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1349
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1350
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>look how amazing I was in that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to work quite hard to go.</v>

1351
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You're very lucky you didn't make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1352
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky you've got born with </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain abilities at a time where people</v>

1353
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:27.014
<v Speaker 1>value that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had this luck when you were </v>

1354
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that thing happened to you.</v>

1355
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.123
<v Speaker 1>I have to re tell myself a story because</v>
<v Speaker 1>my natural propensity will be to claim </v>

1356
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>it back for the ego to pick the ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>backup on the doormat on the way out,</v>

1357
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1358
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:40.003
<v Speaker 1>So how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how are you applying continually </v>

1359
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:42.644
<v Speaker 1>these spiritual principles to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own egos in check with the </v>

1360
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>successes that you have experienced as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Jujitsu wise and as meant?</v>

1361
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.713
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what comes to mind for me as </v>

1362
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>cautious optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very optimistic,</v>

1363
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>very hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope for the best,</v>

1364
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>prepare for the worst mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1365
01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:00.890
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1366
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>be grateful for what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in Jujitsu,</v>

1367
01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu itself is such a humbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

1368
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>The very nature of what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so humbling to come to the mat,</v>

1369
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>train with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other,</v>

1370
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:11.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented training partners and realize </v>

1371
01:02:12.531 --> 01:02:13.101
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>what you don't know and continuously </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharpening that sword that you never get</v>

1373
01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:17.114
<v Speaker 1>too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the confidence that drew to gives </v>

1374
01:02:18.711 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you also prevents you from ever getting</v>

1375
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.933
<v Speaker 2>too low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you stay in this very healthy place </v>

1376
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 2>that even when things are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally well,</v>

1377
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you know that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to prepare for the worst.</v>

1378
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got to be thinking about what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the accident.</v>

1379
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Growing and planting and Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 2>three four moves ahead.</v>

1380
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:34.800
<v Speaker 2>So that game planning for Jujitsu in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real fight can be applied to,</v>

1381
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:35.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to business and to entrepreneurial-ism </v>

1382
01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:39.770
<v Speaker 2>100% and I think that believing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1383
01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.940
<v Speaker 2>things are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things were,</v>

1384
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 2>any of that that's high is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

1385
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's low is going to be high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you right in the middle and always</v>

1386
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>planning for the next step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have your best chance to</v>

1387
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:47.484
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that I've experienced </v>

1388
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:48.564
<v Speaker 2>is that I think is perhaps different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a 12 step person because of the </v>

1389
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and the drugs and I think 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps is about dealing with crisis.</v>

1390
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 2>This is for people that have been broken</v>
<v Speaker 2>in life and sounded like,</v>

1391
01:02:58.801 --> 01:03:02.990
<v Speaker 2>cause I think that I have in a 12 steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>a philosophy that is very applicable.</v>

1392
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>You admit something is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe it could improve,</v>

1393
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you accept help from people or entities </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in that kind of thing but</v>

1394
01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:12.720
<v Speaker 2>more experienced and more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1395
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Then there were some administrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps and some other principals as well,</v>

1396
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.033
<v Speaker 2>but I think that from what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced that this is something that </v>

1397
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 2>becomes relevant when you have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken,</v>

1398
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>when you have become destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does sound comparable to what your</v>

1399
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>grandfather experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a man.</v>

1400
01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:27.654
<v Speaker 2>They experience that kind of humiliation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of some kind and it's a experience of </v>

1401
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 2>humiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that when you're,</v>

1402
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 2>like earlier in the conversation we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about how Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

1403
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 2>we will be applicable to a wide </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographics to children that are afraid</v>

1404
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:41.874
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are worried about sexual </v>

1405
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:47.400
<v Speaker 2>assault to law enforces so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me as well that these,</v>

1406
01:03:47.401 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm interested in this,</v>

1407
01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:49.764
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm excited by a martial art </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people see more brilliant and </v>

1408
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:52.560
<v Speaker 2>glamorous.</v>

1409
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.393
<v Speaker 2>I love that who doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was more important to me is </v>

1410
01:03:55.951 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>that it seemed philosophically flexible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and applicable beyond even the,</v>

1411
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've just discussed beyond the realm</v>

1412
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 2>of the martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1413
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a Jujitsu practice is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1414
01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:10.614
<v Speaker 2>a week out in everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like thinking about the things that go </v>

1415
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.334
<v Speaker 2>down in one practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're fighting against </v>

1416
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:20.730
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing so many hardships.</v>

1417
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You're failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1418
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You're being outsmarted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being manipulated.</v>

1419
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.793
<v Speaker 2>These things are happening to you while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're grappling were being tricked and </v>

1420
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were being threatened.</v>

1421
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.860
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you're under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1422
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 2>there's the risk of injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these things happening.</v>

1423
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Especially right now amongst us to as </v>
<v Speaker 2>black belts finding each other.</v>

1424
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>

1425
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 2>When there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1426
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:44.334
<v Speaker 2>it's like a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when these things go down and we'd </v>

1427
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 2>learned to deal with things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things on the spot,</v>

1428
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 2>on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I experience immense threat.</v>

1429
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have to fall back and use what </v>

1430
01:04:57.181 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I've learned my whole life with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat.</v>

1431
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:04.620
<v Speaker 2>So I just practiced it like you talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier in our 10 minute session,</v>

1432
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>we did a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So three days later when I feel threat,</v>

1433
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at home.</v>

1434
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel threat every day.</v>

1435
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.593
<v Speaker 2>He said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>everything you experienced in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1437
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or 10 minute Jujitsu training </v>

1438
01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:20.434
<v Speaker 2>session that that presents all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and highs and lows of a month </v>

1439
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:24.694
<v Speaker 2>or six months of the average person </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing it out in life or business </v>

1440
01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>or personal relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're basically creating these,</v>

1441
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>this petri dish of experimentation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have constant,</v>

1442
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 2>a refinement of our ability to handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>those outside stimuli,</v>

1443
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1444
01:05:40.931 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fighting stance.</v>

1445
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.053
<v Speaker 2>And let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you can be comfortable applying </v>

1446
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>your living principles in a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>against another human being,</v>

1447
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>then there's nothing that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be uncomfortable dealing with.</v>

1448
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I think in my own personal psychology as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mountain,</v>

1449
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.950
<v Speaker 2>and that's the only gender I'm qualified</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak for the age informs a lot of my</v>

1450
01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:00.784
<v Speaker 2>behavior way beyond actual conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the imagined threat of conflict </v>

1451
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:07.690
<v Speaker 2>really informs me psychologically.</v>

1452
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.231
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:11.130
<v Speaker 2>and fear as a phenomenon and what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense is,</v>

1454
01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 2>is that if I personally spent time </v>
<v Speaker 2>around this kind of energy,</v>

1455
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.260
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a different sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>groundedness.</v>

1456
01:06:17.261 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Speaker 2>He opened out my spirituality into </v>
<v Speaker 2>another area.</v>

1457
01:06:20.381 --> 01:06:21.214
<v Speaker 2>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1458
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like something I've neglected a</v>

1459
01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 2>lot in life and something that it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a good puzzle piece.</v>

1460
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 2>It connects me in a way that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to me.</v>

1461
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It really means when I look at people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to look at every single person on</v>

1462
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 2>this planet and look at them and feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1463
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look at someone and feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1464
01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:41.520
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1465
01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An anger or fear or anything negative.</v>

1466
01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I only want to feel good and no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>how negative they are.</v>

1467
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.790
<v Speaker 2>So I just think about myself as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1468
01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual and a balanced person.</v>

1469
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:57.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu allows me to be the best person </v>

1470
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nicest,</v>

1471
01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>most peaceful person of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says the very common quote is,</v>

1472
01:07:08.381 --> 01:07:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a fighter.</v>

1473
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why I do Jujitsu cause I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lover,</v>

1474
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 2>not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question about it.</v>

1475
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.873
<v Speaker 2>If you've been in those sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it did seem more like fighting </v>

1476
01:07:19.951 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>and loving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were fighting,</v>

1477
01:07:22.361 --> 01:07:26.380
<v Speaker 2>he was loving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about how if you don't want to</v>

1478
01:07:26.381 --> 01:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>do the martial large because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lover,</v>

1479
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:30.750
<v Speaker 2>what that means is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened,</v>

1480
01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:32.003
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to defend yourself by </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting the person because you don't </v>

1481
01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:35.994
<v Speaker 2>know how to do it any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only hurt the person to defend </v>

1482
01:07:38.761 --> 01:07:40.500
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and the other hand,</v>

1483
01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I practice fighting all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you attack me,</v>

1484
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:45.623
<v Speaker 2>I can love you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be remiss to her to </v>

1485
01:07:48.381 --> 01:07:52.400
<v Speaker 2>wrap up this interview without me being </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in some demonstration of a move</v>

1486
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.850
<v Speaker 2>because I've realized I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really loved this conversation.</v>

1487
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I've loved hanging out at the Gracie </v>
<v Speaker 2>University Gracie Academy for this week.</v>

1488
01:07:58.131 --> 01:07:58.964
<v Speaker 2>It's been brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't endorse it hardly enough but </v>

1489
01:08:01.281 --> 01:08:02.114
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it like the punch block series </v>

1490
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:04.924
<v Speaker 2>and the guards and we showed them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that we had worked on in stages one </v>

1491
01:08:06.531 --> 01:08:07.364
<v Speaker 2>through four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen you guys reviewed some of </v>

1492
01:08:07.911 --> 01:08:08.744
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>

1493
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

1494
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:10.723
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is comfort and worst case </v>

1495
01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:13.970
<v Speaker 2>scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is come from worst case scenarios,</v>

1496
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.960
<v Speaker 2>the next peaceable and beautifully you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go out.</v>

1497
01:08:16.961 --> 01:08:17.621
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:08:17.621 --> 01:08:18.454
<v Speaker 2>you wanna get his guard going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to the principal here and </v>

1499
01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:21.104
<v Speaker 2>Russell we'll be doing here with here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the guard right here off </v>

1500
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.583
<v Speaker 2>my Westham soc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be something of that </v>

1501
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:27.310
<v Speaker 2>football club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1502
01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you guys want to slide down south a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

1503
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Come down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the guard,</v>

1504
01:08:29.901 --> 01:08:30.734
<v Speaker 2>wrap him up in Stage one russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have head control arm control here </v>

1505
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrap me up in stage.</v>

1506
01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.830
<v Speaker 2>He lands down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no plan.</v>

1507
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine it Russell.</v>

1508
01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being here with zero gt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

1509
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>What would someone do in your position </v>
<v Speaker 2>who knew nothing right now?</v>

1510
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:45.343
<v Speaker 2>The panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic protect their face and he would </v>

1511
01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 2>just drop bombs through the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the corner in the body.</v>

1512
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 2>You're going to eventually get opened up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting knocked down from you.</v>

1513
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 2>This they're actually for most people </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

1514
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.733
<v Speaker 2>This is actually worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you understand Jujitsu and you </v>

1515
01:08:58.071 --> 01:09:00.080
<v Speaker 2>understand a little bit of distance </v>
<v Speaker 2>management concept,</v>

1516
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 2>which Russell has learned from us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can demonstrate it now.</v>

1517
01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a series of stages to mitigate this</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat and be able to stay safe and calm</v>

1518
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>as a result of that.</v>

1519
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So stage one is when Russell had him </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrapped up,</v>

1520
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>get inside and hug his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rustled the head and arm control that we</v>

1521
01:09:13.051 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 2>talked about yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrap that arm and you're here.</v>

1522
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:16.640
<v Speaker 2>This is called stage one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if,</v>

1523
01:09:16.641 --> 01:09:19.190
<v Speaker 2>let's say we're here and he don't start </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pull body punches,</v>

1524
01:09:19.191 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>bring your knee and side Russell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stage to other knee.</v>

1525
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.530
<v Speaker 2>So now he's blocking punches at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second stage of protection.</v>

1526
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 2>If he don't sits up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on his chest,</v>

1527
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:27.074
<v Speaker 2>rust it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1528
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.090
<v Speaker 2>He's blocking now at stage three now he </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1529
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:30.800
<v Speaker 2>can't reach punches from there cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too far.</v>

1530
01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 2>And if he stands up stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't on the hips,</v>

1531
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.003
<v Speaker 2>this is called stage four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with all these stages you noticed </v>

1532
01:09:36.161 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>that how he was never at the range to </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock you out.</v>

1533
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And then from there punch punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him back in,</v>

1534
01:09:40.071 --> 01:09:40.904
<v Speaker 2>rust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap his head up and he's back to stage </v>

1535
01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1536
01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's a cycle and you can go from </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage one to stage three,</v>

1537
01:09:44.301 --> 01:09:45.134
<v Speaker 2>stayed up to three right there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on his chest book or for Direct Punch </v>

1538
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:48.561
<v Speaker 2>Punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let him back in.</v>

1539
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

1540
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.143
<v Speaker 2>And he pulls him back down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be able to meet and what happens </v>

1541
01:09:52.311 --> 01:09:53.144
<v Speaker 2>throughout all these exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's burning energy trying to hit you </v>

1542
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.860
<v Speaker 2>and you're just managing the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can't knock you out.</v>

1543
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.900
<v Speaker 2>So he's exhausting while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>preserving,</v>

1544
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:02.170
<v Speaker 2>having a lovely cuddle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you relax,</v>

1545
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>if you relax like we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't tense up to me,</v>

1546
01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:07.220
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why south tense?</v>

1547
01:10:07.221 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 2>It's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you control from here.</v>

1548
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:10.874
<v Speaker 2>And then we have your triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do to try and bring your </v>

1549
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 2>own inside of the here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring your knee inside.</v>

1550
01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's where you push his arm away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring your knee inside his arm slowly.</v>

1551
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't comes in.</v>

1552
01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:18.344
<v Speaker 2>Now slide two is risk to your boss and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull your leg up and around his </v>

1553
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:20.810
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

1554
01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Cross that leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the arm across.</v>

1555
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Shoves his arm over and I'll grab his </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1556
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 2>He'd lock your legs up nice and tight </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1557
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Squeeze your thighs together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab your Shin tight thighs.</v>

1558
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Everything's squeezed down and pull your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head down,</v>

1559
01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>puts his head down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Squeeze your driver's head,</v>

1560
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:31.880
<v Speaker 2>grab his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Think,</v>

1561
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's said s six seconds.</v>

1562
01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.950
<v Speaker 2>And that principle right there is called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind wind principle.</v>

1563
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>You do the move you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he taps out and you let go.</v>

1564
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could think about this,</v>

1565
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you didn't hurt me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt my ego.</v>

1566
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:46.543
<v Speaker 2>He neutralized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably went for a triangle and I feel </v>

1567
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:52.400
<v Speaker 2>a little pressure on my neck and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>tap or I cough a little bit and then you</v>

1568
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

1569
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.013
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't punch my face and break my </v>

1570
01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 2>nose and have to let go of me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1571
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Speaker 2>is everything cool here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of like,</v>

1572
01:10:59.691 --> 01:11:00.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half fell asleep but say I pass out a </v>

1573
01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 2>little bit and now we can stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a cup of tea.</v>

1574
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>There doesn't have to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No alcohol.</v>

1575
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 2>That was cause I'm English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1576
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:08.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no alcohol.</v>

1577
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.730
<v Speaker 2>That's lovely to be able to neutralize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the threat for the,</v>

1578
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 2>to be able to put out the fire without </v>
<v Speaker 2>adding more fire to it.</v>

1579
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.313
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She able to stop violence without </v>

1580
01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:19.674
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see how this is so applicable to </v>

1581
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.970
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof and into a child who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting bullied?</v>

1582
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>

1583
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 2>congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're growing up three,</v>

1584
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:27.871
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1585
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:28.704
<v Speaker 2>six years old and someone's picking on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and you didn't have Jujitsu to </v>

1586
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 2>teach them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

1587
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:33.174
<v Speaker 2>hey child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over there and punch him in the nose </v>

1588
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have another resource </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help them stand up for themselves.</v>

1589
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:43.140
<v Speaker 2>And then you basically turn your child </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the bully to fight the bully.</v>

1590
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.093
<v Speaker 2>But Jujitsu is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a gentle approach to the same </v>

1591
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:47.064
<v Speaker 2>threats that it neutralizes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they could literally be friends </v>

1592
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 2>after the altercation is complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My children,</v>

1593
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.403
<v Speaker 2>they will not even call Jujitsu fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the time comes where they're getting </v>

1594
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:56.334
<v Speaker 2>bullied and they're at seven years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nine years old and they start doing </v>

1595
01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't fight the kid at school.</v>

1596
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:04.290
<v Speaker 2>They just controlled the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we think of it as fighting,</v>

1597
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.870
<v Speaker 2>then we're gonna turn our kids do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1598
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 2>change your idea of what it means for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids to stand up for themselves and</v>

1599
01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:13.190
<v Speaker 2>fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you use Fujitsu,</v>

1600
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 2>you're not fighting back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an [inaudible].</v>

1601
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I've already fought that mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to teach my doula mabel that like</v>

1602
01:12:21.111 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when she says I am angry to say</v>

1603
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.751
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1604
01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you're not angry.</v>

1605
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Just in this moment you are experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger.</v>

1606
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.003
<v Speaker 2>The anger will pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are saying that you could </v>

1607
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:32.130
<v Speaker 2>reframe the whole way they see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1608
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:32.964
<v Speaker 2>but even a situation which a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people live with fear of physical </v>

1609
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see it as just as,</v>

1610
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:40.390
<v Speaker 2>oh this is that thing happening where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the gentle cuddling of Jujitsu.</v>

1611
01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We'd be doing this on your do a on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home with them just on the carpet.</v>

1612
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:45.894
<v Speaker 2>You just played Jujitsu so they won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitate to tackle the kid that's been </v>

1613
01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:51.300
<v Speaker 2>bugging them for the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't see that as a fight.</v>

1614
01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:52.134
<v Speaker 2>They see that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a physical resolution to a threat </v>

1615
01:12:54.511 --> 01:12:56.820
<v Speaker 2>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not as a violent proposition.</v>

1616
01:12:56.821 --> 01:12:57.654
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be no barrier to prevent </v>

1617
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>them from doing what they need to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the biggest problem,</v>

1618
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and we did a video of this recently with</v>
<v Speaker 2>our friend Vince Vaughn,</v>

1619
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:04.644
<v Speaker 2>who's also a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we talked about this concept of the </v>

1620
01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 2>biggest kind of threatened concern you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have for kids in schools is not even the</v>

1621
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 2>bully.</v>

1622
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.730
<v Speaker 2>It's the policies that are implemented </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to prevent bullying,</v>

1623
01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 2>the called zero tolerance kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullying policies,</v>

1624
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 2>which means if someone's teasing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong,</v>

1625
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.080
<v Speaker 2>but if you stand up for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also wrong.</v>

1626
01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:22.914
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to both get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a problem because then a </v>

1627
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:25.704
<v Speaker 2>child is paralyzed by a policy and will </v>
<v Speaker 2>not defend themselves because they're </v>

1628
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:29.934
<v Speaker 2>not allowed to fight at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who is involved in a fight is </v>

1629
01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:32.910
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both kids get suspended.</v>

1630
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 2>So you have a policy that's meant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help the victims of bullying,</v>

1631
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>but it actually enables the bullies </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I tease you and poke you,</v>

1632
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I know you can't stand up for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll get in trouble if you do.</v>

1633
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:44.663
<v Speaker 2>So the good kids are handcuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bad kids take advantage of the fact </v>

1634
01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:48.444
<v Speaker 2>that no one else can stand up to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can get away with all the </v>

1635
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 2>bullying they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a parent's job to say,</v>

1636
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son or daughter,</v>

1637
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever the school policy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry.</v>

1638
01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:56.454
<v Speaker 2>You can always do your self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can always neutralize any threat </v>

1639
01:13:59.251 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 2>against you in a nonviolent way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to be wrong with me.</v>

1640
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.150
<v Speaker 2>And if it's wrong with the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all deal with the school myself.</v>

1641
01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.013
<v Speaker 2>But if a child needs to hear that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents and otherwise they remain </v>

1642
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:10.120
<v Speaker 2>handcuffs serious.</v>

1643
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And back to what you said when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principal's office.</v>

1644
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're in trouble for fighting.</v>

1645
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't fighting principal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't fighting.</v>

1646
01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.473
<v Speaker 2>I was just neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would be the person talking to them </v>

1647
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 2>with a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fight.</v>

1648
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't punch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make them.</v>

1649
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I just held him down until the teacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>came fighting his punches and kicks.</v>

1650
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>What world are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very beautiful.</v>

1651
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that you have reframing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1652
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:34.620
<v Speaker 2>You're reframing fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reframing conflict and come back.</v>

1653
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>You're helping me to address things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like the psychological issues that</v>

1654
01:14:37.991 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>probably laying about in the landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my mind and addressed for a very long</v>

1655
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1656
01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:45.250
<v Speaker 2>very grateful to both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
