<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the show Pankaj.</v>

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>What I know of your work suggests to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are addressing themes that have</v>

12
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>interest did us on under the skin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven us w w w but on a huge scale.</v>

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.913
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to address there the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence of what we've been trying to </v>

14
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>tackle on a global scale.</v>

15
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Your latest book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of anger.</v>

16
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about rage that that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a sort of,</v>

17
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>this is a time that is determined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

18
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.933
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cross culturally regardless of </v>

19
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>where you are in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic story?</v>

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Like whether it's like the claps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire that you know,</v>

21
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:18.934
<v Speaker 1>and nostalgia that's been experienced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country or the United States where </v>

22
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>rage is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like a very present emotion,</v>

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>rage and despair on recent visits to </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

24
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.313
<v Speaker 1>I sort of felt enough the few public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces that I was in a sense a sense of </v>

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>a society ill at ease with itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

26
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and I've experienced it in these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>western nations,</v>

27
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying in India is this also </v>
<v Speaker 1>a uh,</v>

28
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 1>a modern cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the at the center of rage?</v>

29
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the experience of disaffection or rage </v>
<v Speaker 2>is at this moment truly global,</v>

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.733
<v Speaker 2>truly common amongst you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nations regardless of where they are in </v>

32
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.564
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called,</v>

33
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

35
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 2>this particular tragic tree of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of economic growth.</v>

36
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 2>So in the advanced countries as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the developed world,</v>

37
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>the developing countries and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>

38
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's because in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

39
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.624
<v Speaker 2>in a context like the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has enjoyed a great deal of power </v>

40
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people feel that,</v>

41
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future and this is an unprecedented </v>

42
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.551
<v Speaker 2>shift would be considerably worse then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they have been accustomed to,</v>

43
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 2>what the parents and grandparents that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are not really passing on.</v>

44
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.693
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was to the children or the </v>

45
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren in wish they can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope to flourish.</v>

46
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And this is important package because </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressivism is the defining attribute,</v>

47
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>the essence of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once progression stops,</v>

48
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>once the next generation of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang on a minute,</v>

49
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>things are getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to own our houses,</v>

50
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to have jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were already mired in debt.</v>

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>The whole thrust of our national </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities is undermined,</v>

52
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.800
<v Speaker 2>is the crux of the crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

53
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress was,</v>

54
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.780
<v Speaker 2>the substitute was a replacement for </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

55
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.773
<v Speaker 2>This notion of continuous improvement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was truly radical when we killed </v>

56
00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:23.384
<v Speaker 2>off God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we moved away from traditional </v>

57
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.130
<v Speaker 2>religion be devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new belief system,</v>

58
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.293
<v Speaker 2>that there will be continuous progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have revised our existence on </v>

59
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:33.944
<v Speaker 2>this fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean we must not underestimate the </v>

60
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.210
<v Speaker 2>radical shifts we are undergoing right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

61
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.143
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose if you were living in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that is experiencing continued </v>

62
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.183
<v Speaker 1>economic growth and progression or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least a significant portion of the </v>

63
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>population are experiencing it enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain the momentum,</v>

64
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.893
<v Speaker 1>then there is no need for God </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly that it when the idea of </v>

65
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>God is often eh demonstrated through </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor worship,</v>

66
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>we are like our ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live like them,</v>

67
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that we are connected to this origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth,</v>

68
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.854
<v Speaker 1>this origin story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and through these rituals we connect to </v>

69
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our relationship with God.</v>

70
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>We are part of the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see continual progression,</v>

71
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.864
<v Speaker 1>when you've seen an advancement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and obviously the shifts </v>

72
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.883
<v Speaker 1>philosophically that occurred a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hundred years ago that you mentioned </v>

73
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:20.944
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to see us as separate </v>

74
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:24.754
<v Speaker 1>from God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God as the idea of originator creator </v>

75
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>progenator.</v>

76
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.631
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

77
00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:32.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a radical idea in or some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone warned about this,</v>

78
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.463
<v Speaker 2>that progress is the false gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chip when he said that God is dead </v>

79
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and we haven't faced up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

80
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.654
<v Speaker 2>This is what he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've given our belief in a </v>

81
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.043
<v Speaker 2>transcendental authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've given up believe in this God who </v>

82
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>lays down laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who orders our societies.</v>

83
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 2>We have decided to go do it all by </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and we have invested our faith</v>

84
00:04:55.641 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 2>in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is a false religion.</v>

85
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think in many ways this moment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil is in that pc today,</v>

86
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>globally is this realization that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is faltering,</v>

87
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>that there are not enough believers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the religion of progress.</v>

88
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>This is the biggest shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm really talking about in</v>

89
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is what I mean,</v>

90
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>that we need to have a broader framework</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand what is going on today.</v>

91
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are obviously many aspect of this,</v>

92
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic inequality and of obviously</v>

93
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.443
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the rage is fuel by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that the promises happy and </v>

94
00:05:38.301 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 2>unrealized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been fulfill.</v>

95
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 2>They've been cheated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been deceived.</v>

96
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 2>But it's also because they have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>promised a great deal,</v>

97
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 2>especially in the last three decades of </v>
<v Speaker 2>globalization.</v>

98
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever believe when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.873
<v Speaker 1>sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research an ethno nationalism fails </v>

100
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:54.864
<v Speaker 1>to deliver and I suppose there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of ethno nationalism or least </v>

101
00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:02.261
<v Speaker 1>sort of a re a religiously led ethno </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism in India also when I suppose</v>

102
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>when these modalities foul or deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be further disappointment and</v>

103
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.994
<v Speaker 1>further rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just to ask you a sort of a personal </v>

104
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.580
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuming a,</v>

105
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>if you grew up in a village in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing your religious town.</v>

106
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.393
<v Speaker 1>So you had a religious talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing to you believe in God and what </v>

107
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>kind of religion were you raised in?</v>

108
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Personally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

109
00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:22.554
<v Speaker 2>I think of myself as someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>iridium irredeemably be secularized in </v>

110
00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:29.140
<v Speaker 2>the sense that I cannot be religious in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way my parents are religious,</v>

111
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.373
<v Speaker 2>religious in the sense of thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that happens in the world is </v>

112
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>due to God is because there is a hidden </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible force behind all of it.</v>

113
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.923
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then everything that happens can be </v>

114
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 2>explained with reference to this figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that is,</v>

115
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 2>it will be that I now can no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>enter.</v>

116
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.600
<v Speaker 2>But when you begin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

117
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.493
<v Speaker 2>when you are in proximity to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do realize that the big shift </v>

118
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.270
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

119
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see that happening right now,</v>

120
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that shift happened here a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

121
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 2>In places like India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can still see it happening.</v>

122
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.133
<v Speaker 2>Is this shift from belief in </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendental authority to this belief </v>

123
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Speaker 2>in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in material improvement?</v>

124
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that just a different form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent or authority?</v>

125
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

126
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that was the mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in the 19th century were</v>

127
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:29.774
<v Speaker 2>pointing to Dostoevsky or nature that </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you bring down the Kingdom of God </v>

128
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 2>onto earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will have trouble.</v>

129
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.983
<v Speaker 2>Once you start thinking that what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>promised to you in the afterlife can be </v>

130
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>recreated on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you start thinking in those terms,</v>

131
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 2>then you've set yourself up for cruel </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment.</v>

132
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

133
00:07:53.851 --> 00:07:58.851
<v Speaker 1>it seems that we've become quite muddled</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our interpretation of myth.</v>

134
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I hear the phrase after life,</v>

135
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the resonance of that for me </v>

136
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:13.200
<v Speaker 1>personally is now when my material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human life as Russell,</v>

137
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:18.201
<v Speaker 1>the individual where my ego life ceases </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the dominant driving principle for</v>

138
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:23.190
<v Speaker 1>my existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will experience inadvertent Commerce,</v>

139
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise freed from the ego.</v>

140
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.250
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.083
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see sort of perennial messages </v>

142
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>between Hinduism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism,</v>

143
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

144
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I know very little about all three of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those theologies,</v>

145
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.473
<v Speaker 1>just enough to know that there seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an idea of essence and even the more </v>

146
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:46.810
<v Speaker 1>folkish and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming less academic understanding</v>

147
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that one imagines that your parents may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had,</v>

148
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

149
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.790
<v Speaker 1>that could have been a professor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theology.</v>

150
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:52.624
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing when people talk about </v>

151
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.453
<v Speaker 1>religion and sort of quite folkish terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a transcendent or fora a got this </v>

152
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.704
<v Speaker 1>basically governing everything I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta eve like even with my limited </v>

153
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the mechanics of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material world,</v>

154
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I can see a use for that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an analogy,</v>

155
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I can see a use for the idea of supreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>or transcendent,</v>

156
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>hopefully benevolent or authority.</v>

157
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.823
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has become hugely fashionable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mock religion or people who are </v>

159
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 2>religious as essentially superstitious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant,</v>

160
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.353
<v Speaker 2>barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we forget that religion is a huge </v>

161
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:31.030
<v Speaker 2>source of constellation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps people accommodate,</v>

162
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helps people to accommodate themselves </v>

163
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:35.950
<v Speaker 2>to grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to loss,</v>

164
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.820
<v Speaker 2>to disappointment and disappointment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fate for most people.</v>

165
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact possibly all people.</v>

166
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause sometimes when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented in terms of a consolation,</v>

167
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 1>like that's sort of sort of common new </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist argument,</v>

168
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.920
<v Speaker 1>oh it's for Sakos to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for constantly,</v>

169
00:09:50.921 --> 00:09:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but I sort of feel like you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

170
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.030
<v Speaker 1>The material world isn't going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happy.</v>

171
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Your primal drives are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficient in making you satisfied.</v>

172
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Your Ego is going to let you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to fail you,</v>

173
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.023
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to need constellation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on that side as well as </v>

174
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:09.040
<v Speaker 1>constellation eight becomes a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creed,</v>

175
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.070
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a kind of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a kind of meaning.</v>

176
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think a fabricated one </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

177
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I think a necessary ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a central one.</v>

178
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.083
<v Speaker 1>Whilst I recognize that most religions </v>
<v Speaker 1>have cultural accouterments of their </v>

179
00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:26.350
<v Speaker 1>time that are unhelpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudicial,</v>

180
00:10:26.351 --> 00:10:27.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those are the things that I try </v>

181
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:32.560
<v Speaker 1>personally to look beyond to this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of powerful truths beneath them.</v>

182
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:10:33.671 --> 00:10:34.504
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pankaj very the beginning of our </v>

184
00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have,</v>

185
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.163
<v Speaker 1>you said you're very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>important shift in the last couple </v>

186
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.900
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically,</v>

187
00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and we mentioned colonialism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialization as two components.</v>

188
00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:48.244
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in the philosophical </v>

189
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:50.224
<v Speaker 1>component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're talk about voltaire and </v>

190
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Russo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

191
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers were a little earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

192
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:57.730
<v Speaker 1>but tell us what their significance is.</v>

193
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use these figures to highlight certain</v>

194
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.294
<v Speaker 2>contradictions in the modern project </v>
<v Speaker 2>which were apparent before and modern </v>

195
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:08.180
<v Speaker 2>societies came into being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

196
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>in the late 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it very,</v>

197
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:13.430
<v Speaker 2>very broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

198
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late 18th century we're faced </v>

199
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:21.791
<v Speaker 2>with this large question that okay we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are moving away from societies,</v>

200
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.833
<v Speaker 2>from a world in which the church was </v>
<v Speaker 2>important in which belief in God was </v>

201
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:27.734
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the monarchy was all </v>

202
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:30.984
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are moving towards societies where </v>

203
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>people are going to devise a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract for themselves,</v>

204
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are going to use individual</v>

205
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:39.904
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are going to use the new </v>

206
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.233
<v Speaker 2>insights of science to master nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these were the big debates happening </v>

207
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>during the late 18th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

208
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.720
<v Speaker 2>what we now call the moment that we now </v>
<v Speaker 2>call the enlightenment,</v>

209
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.200
<v Speaker 2>the two major figures of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

210
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>of this enlightened where voltaire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russo and the debate,</v>

211
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.173
<v Speaker 2>the conflict between them emerges </v>
<v Speaker 2>because full there is offering a model </v>

212
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 2>and a blueprint for society that we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less living in today,</v>

213
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a society driven by self </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

214
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:19.110
<v Speaker 2>by the entrepreneurial spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by self interested individuals competing</v>

215
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:26.461
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the ideas of science to advance,</v>

216
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 2>to expand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to expand their powers.</v>

217
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Speaker 2>And Rousseau who comes from very </v>
<v Speaker 2>different backgrounds,</v>

218
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 2>social backgrounds also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the difference?</v>

219
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

220
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

221
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 2>he's known poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's known deprivation,</v>

222
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

223
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.401
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his,</v>

224
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>in his early years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on the side even forever.</v>

225
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.900
<v Speaker 2>It's on a path and I see all our </v>
<v Speaker 2>mufflers,</v>

226
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 2>film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>streaks,</v>

227
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 2>yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he knife fights.</v>

228
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.003
<v Speaker 2>So he comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes to Paris and find themselves </v>

229
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.080
<v Speaker 2>alienated by this new world of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers talk to each other who were</v>

230
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 2>very interested in forming alliances </v>
<v Speaker 2>with powerful people,</v>

231
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.813
<v Speaker 2>some of the most powerful monarchs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day because they think the monarchs </v>

233
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>are the right people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.533
<v Speaker 2>sort of early version of the new concept</v>
<v Speaker 2>today who sidle up to presidents and </v>

235
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 2>prime ministers and offer them advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

236
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 2>here's what you should do in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>modernize your society.</v>

237
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 2>So this kind of rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

238
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Russo is completely against and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about human needs,</v>

239
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 2>the needs of the human soul.</v>

240
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.001
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

241
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:38.001
<v Speaker 2>and he thinks that the society premised </v>
<v Speaker 2>on self interest on vanity,</v>

242
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.863
<v Speaker 2>on imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on people trying to keep up with the </v>

243
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Joneses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to imitate the rich,</v>

244
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.963
<v Speaker 2>the wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous is a recipe for all kinds of </v>

245
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 2>disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To use a word we,</v>

246
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.730
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

247
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 2>brought up earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of psychological disorders.</v>

248
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And he said he's a sort of acute </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist of the human soul,</v>

249
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.940
<v Speaker 2>partly because he himself is suffering </v>
<v Speaker 2>from all kinds of problems.</v>

250
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Envy being one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Santino he was at Maine.</v>

251
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sort of compound of emotions,</v>

252
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>envy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of humiliation,</v>

253
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 2>feeling of powerlessness and it's sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of large restlessness.</v>

254
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>You think it might mean a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that.</v>

255
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I try and argue in the book that we</v>

256
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 2>are sort of looking at a global epidemic</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reason.</v>

257
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.343
<v Speaker 2>Timo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where large numbers of people feel this </v>

258
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:36.904
<v Speaker 2>emotion importantly for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the moment comes as it came </v>

259
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>during brexit and during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the trump election,</v>

260
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.673
<v Speaker 2>it erupts volcanically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Russo in many ways is anticipating </v>

261
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:51.244
<v Speaker 2>the pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intolerable strain this new society </v>

262
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 2>promotes around self interest and vanity</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to put on the human soul.</v>

263
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of prophesies is in a sense that</v>

264
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:07.270
<v Speaker 1>this will lead us to this crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will lead us to a spiritual crisis.</v>

265
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Russo also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about like the noble savage.</v>

266
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

267
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:16.380
<v Speaker 1>The idea that innately we are connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that there is a,</v>

268
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.090
<v Speaker 1>in simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

269
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>prehistoric or traditional cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a beauty.</v>

270
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.290
<v Speaker 1>There is a grace that human</v>

271
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's,</v>

272
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.700
<v Speaker 2>what's actually interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 2>what is in fact I'm creating this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular image in Rousseau's.</v>

274
00:15:31.801 --> 00:15:32.634
<v Speaker 2>Mine are the discoveries European </v>
<v Speaker 2>travelers are making in the new world </v>

275
00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 2>when they're encountering indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>peoples in these places.</v>

276
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.600
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing back reports of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>these societies work.</v>

277
00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So the whole idea of people living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

278
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.350
<v Speaker 2>This is a sort of particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction that Rousseau,</v>

279
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.213
<v Speaker 2>someone like Rousseau absorb many among </v>
<v Speaker 2>many other people and and uses that to </v>

280
00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:56.250
<v Speaker 2>critique this new society that is coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>into being,</v>

281
00:15:56.251 --> 00:15:57.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion for instance,</v>

282
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.793
<v Speaker 2>is hugely important to Rousseau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks the innate revulsion we feel </v>

283
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.480
<v Speaker 2>at the sight of someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

284
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.670
<v Speaker 2>That should be the basis of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract,</v>

285
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tried to use that as a feel.</v>

286
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.353
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these essential bases that political </v>

287
00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:22.111
<v Speaker 1>movements and political moments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow ultimately underwritten by inner</v>

288
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.393
<v Speaker 1>phenomena or inner frequencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Rousseau argues that compassion </v>

289
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.680
<v Speaker 1>should be the basis for our social </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts.</v>

290
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.603
<v Speaker 1>And what we're experiencing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you argue in your book is rage as the </v>

291
00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>determinant that w or respond to more a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of worthlessness.</v>

292
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.933
<v Speaker 1>And like this for me seems most familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like one of my frustrations is to </v>

293
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:52.630
<v Speaker 1>see the way that brexit has subsequently</v>
<v Speaker 1>been packaged by the sort of,</v>

294
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:54.940
<v Speaker 1>certainly in terms of the media that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant,</v>

295
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.893
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers of our story that the dominant </v>

296
00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.950
<v Speaker 1>cultural commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

297
00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:04.300
<v Speaker 1>what brexit means is racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ordinary people are racist.</v>

298
00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that that is the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reductive ism that led to brexit.</v>

299
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:09.964
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what actually has happened </v>

300
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:14.940
<v Speaker 1>is a breakdown between the proletariat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bourgeoisie that the bourgeoisie</v>

301
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:19.210
<v Speaker 1>and no longer interested in representing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interest of ordinary working people,</v>

302
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.133
<v Speaker 1>ordinary working people have began to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that and while certainly </v>

303
00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:23.704
<v Speaker 1>concerned about migration and racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could they not be part of a </v>

304
00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:30.970
<v Speaker 1>narrative given how much those ideas are</v>
<v Speaker 1>propagated through mainstream media?</v>

305
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it's more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

306
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I think the shift is between a middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class intelligentsia sort of abandoned,</v>

307
00:17:38.951 --> 00:17:39.784
<v Speaker 1>ordinary working people to form a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance with the powerful and to </v>

308
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.853
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate their radicalism merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>through superficial allegiances with </v>

309
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 1>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity politics as like,</v>

310
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.093
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're very good on gender rights </v>

311
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>were very good and the quality in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>race without consequence,</v>

312
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer addressing the key issue of </v>

313
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>all societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we control the powerful,</v>

314
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 1>how do we confront the powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we bring about equality,</v>

315
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 1>fairness as a society based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion that you said that Russo's</v>

316
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.703
<v Speaker 2>I feel it's a huge mistake to judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who vote for trump or who voted </v>

317
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:21.034
<v Speaker 2>for brexit as racists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's counterproductive apart from </v>

318
00:18:25.421 --> 00:18:26.440
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

319
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

320
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.950
<v Speaker 2>it's totally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who voted for trump also</v>

321
00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:33.760
<v Speaker 2>voted for Obama the biggest hoax of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

322
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

323
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.320
<v Speaker 1>so what a Bama is the biggest hoax </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding.</v>

324
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.173
<v Speaker 1>So I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because we've had an </v>

325
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>academic in here a little while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

326
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.374
<v Speaker 1>Hindi Andrews is professor of sociology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Black Studies at Birmingham </v>

327
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.003
<v Speaker 1>University who said that trump is a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic or better president for black </v>

328
00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:51.654
<v Speaker 1>America than a Bama because it no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceals submerged inequalities and </v>

329
00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:01.041
<v Speaker 1>ongoing racism was the embodiment of new</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal chic</v>

330
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.830
<v Speaker 2>and managed to conceal as your other </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests said,</v>

331
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.263
<v Speaker 2>a whole range of grotesque inequalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this very seductive personal </v>

332
00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:18.560
<v Speaker 2>style he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.170
<v Speaker 2>we getting on a different subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>altogether,</v>

334
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think in many ways Obama and eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of Obama,</v>

335
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enabled someone like Donald Trump and if</v>

336
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 2>you don't see this connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we insist on thinking of Donald Trump</v>

337
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 2>as someone who just arrived in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States from somewhere in Mars,</v>

338
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.750
<v Speaker 1>we are going to miss this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Is your age in a desperate attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue the neo liberal narrative?</v>

340
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Trump is presented as some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grotesque anomaly,</v>

341
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.500
<v Speaker 1>a product of racism when he is precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>a product of neo liberalism is precisely</v>

342
00:19:56.841 --> 00:19:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the end point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

343
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.143
<v Speaker 1>how can people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does society not have fest are </v>

344
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:02.804
<v Speaker 1>festering sense of separation and eh and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of otherness when we've just </v>

345
00:20:08.031 --> 00:20:08.864
<v Speaker 1>experienced 2030 years have been pumped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up like anti-islamic sentiment sort of </v>

346
00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:17.270
<v Speaker 1>like pre nine 11 at these stories have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going on for a long,</v>

347
00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:18.104
<v Speaker 1>long while and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels to me that this moment is </v>

348
00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:21.524
<v Speaker 1>simply some someone's just drew like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridden that wave a wave that sort of </v>

349
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:29.570
<v Speaker 1>being created by cyclonic racism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing</v>

350
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.920
<v Speaker 2>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

351
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.461
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:36.461
<v Speaker 2>trump is the image that we don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to confront of us in the mirror and</v>

353
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.430
<v Speaker 2>it's because we keep thinking of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other era of which most of us people who</v>

354
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:44.600
<v Speaker 2>write in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

355
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>in you work for the mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I include myself are beneficiaries,</v>

356
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 2>have been beneficiaries of the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives,</v>

357
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>our material lives have improved </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormously in the last 2030 years.</v>

358
00:20:56.351 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 2>So we have enormous investments in </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping this particular narrative going.</v>

359
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.413
<v Speaker 2>And one way of doing it is to say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who bought for trump are </v>

360
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:07.670
<v Speaker 2>deplorables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are racists,</v>

361
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.810
<v Speaker 2>and that there is something like true </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberalism out there.</v>

362
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.673
<v Speaker 2>If only people would listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If only people could understand what is </v>

363
00:21:15.561 --> 00:21:16.394
<v Speaker 2>good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead they follow the racist thing </v>

364
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 2>stinks and vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a deliberate misdiagnosis.</v>

365
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.301
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

366
00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:27.810
<v Speaker 2>this is a real distortion of what has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been happening,</v>

367
00:21:27.811 --> 00:21:30.080
<v Speaker 2>not just in the United States elsewhere.</v>

368
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact,</v>

369
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to,</v>

370
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.470
<v Speaker 2>so the promise of freedom with which the</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern world begins.</v>

371
00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Freedom from authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom from custom,</v>

372
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.790
<v Speaker 2>the fact that for many people this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>become hugely,</v>

373
00:21:44.791 --> 00:21:49.791
<v Speaker 2>hugely impossible to realize because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of our institutions,</v>

374
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.333
<v Speaker 2>the increasing centralization of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that most people find </v>

375
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:00.510
<v Speaker 2>themselves reduced to cogs in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

376
00:22:00.511 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 2>in a boss machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people find very little stability,</v>

377
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.790
<v Speaker 2>very little dignity in their working </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

378
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 2>All this has led to this moment that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are experiencing today.</v>

379
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

380
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:14.831
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 2>on one hand this extravagant promise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>

382
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.683
<v Speaker 2>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fact of structural </v>

383
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:23.794
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that mobility is blocked for </v>

384
00:22:27.621 --> 00:22:30.440
<v Speaker 2>most people unless he belonged to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right family,</v>

385
00:22:30.441 --> 00:22:32.780
<v Speaker 2>unless you belong to the right dynasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you belong,</v>

386
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 2>unless you go to the right college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

387
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 2>this is not something that I'm saying or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few people are saying.</v>

388
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:43.801
<v Speaker 2>This is now been demonstrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirically with all kinds of data.</v>

389
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that college educated people </v>

390
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 2>have a huge advantage over everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

391
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:54.270
<v Speaker 2>That morbidity has been blocked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>large numbers of people.</v>

392
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.553
<v Speaker 2>So we are looking at a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunction in which all the founding </v>

393
00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 2>promises of the modern world look almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to fulfill</v>

394
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.560
<v Speaker 1>if feels like the conditions are correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>for genuine radicalism,</v>

395
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.573
<v Speaker 1>for real radical change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that there's potential for </v>

396
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:20.190
<v Speaker 1>explosive global change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think that it's,</v>

397
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think those societies to </v>

398
00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:23.874
<v Speaker 1>sectarian two fractured cause?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it because I'm a public </v>

399
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:29.300
<v Speaker 1>performer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am often [inaudible] and I work in a,</v>

400
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.590
<v Speaker 1>mostly in this country at the moment I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

401
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm often in regional spaces of with </v>
<v Speaker 1>1500 or a couple of thousand people </v>

402
00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:37.284
<v Speaker 1>doing stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I talk about is </v>

403
00:23:38.521 --> 00:23:39.354
<v Speaker 1>how the powerful continually invite </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary working people to I want to </v>

404
00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:44.990
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

405
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.200
<v Speaker 1>suspiciously when I as a veil for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions of the powerful.</v>

406
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So like I sort of watch people's faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

407
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will always do what you've always </v>

408
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:57.464
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blame other people that are basically </v>

409
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 1>the same as you that don't have power </v>
<v Speaker 1>for things that only powerful people can</v>

410
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 1>affect or change.</v>

411
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in the show I say,</v>

412
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with disabled.</v>

413
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the white working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class.</v>

414
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:10.131
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

415
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck can you thanks for your vote.</v>

416
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>See you in four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see that this divides the room.</v>

417
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I see that people are uncomfortable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting go of more immediate sense of it</v>

418
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.013
<v Speaker 1>is the problem I feel sometimes with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is there are certain stories that </v>

419
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:28.754
<v Speaker 1>are easier to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is stories that are more visceral </v>

420
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.460
<v Speaker 1>that relate more to our experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being human.</v>

421
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.473
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concealed power is very difficult to </v>

422
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By its very nature,</v>

423
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.351
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

424
00:24:41.351 --> 00:24:46.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other factor is that in the West and</v>

425
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:51.581
<v Speaker 2>western Europe and the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had mass movements for change</v>

426
00:24:52.641 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

427
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time we had mass movements,</v>

428
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.380
<v Speaker 2>large numbers of people participating in</v>
<v Speaker 2>them against the war for civil rights,</v>

429
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.700
<v Speaker 2>feminist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

430
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.040
<v Speaker 2>these all happened in the 1960s and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

431
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.263
<v Speaker 2>So whole memory of popular participation</v>
<v Speaker 2>in politics of large numbers of people </v>

432
00:25:15.121 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>coming together for a particular cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>of justice,</v>

433
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.710
<v Speaker 2>bonding together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling degree of solidarity.</v>

434
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.810
<v Speaker 2>That memory has been x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

435
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:26.160
<v Speaker 2>completely expunged</v>

436
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.523
<v Speaker 1>possibly because of the success of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy that you said Voltaire was </v>

437
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:32.474
<v Speaker 1>exemplary of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do regard ourselves as individuals </v>

438
00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:35.834
<v Speaker 1>now that liberalism that it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom to be an individual and freedom </v>

439
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:41.144
<v Speaker 1>to meet be an individual means freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be disconnected and an inability to </v>

440
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:49.280
<v Speaker 1>see your identity is integral to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the roles,</v>

441
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.114
<v Speaker 1>relationships and destinies of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are basically just the same as if </v>

442
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an interdependent society.</v>

443
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we live in an interdependent</v>

444
00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:59.643
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

445
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something the Buddhist started </v>

446
00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:03.850
<v Speaker 2>talking about 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

447
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book about the put that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>this team feature is a great deal.</v>

448
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.063
<v Speaker 2>The team of interdependence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the would that invoke in order to </v>

449
00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:18.600
<v Speaker 2>critique the rising notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism at the time.</v>

450
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

451
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 2>this notion of the individual self that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to express fine,</v>

452
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 2>that has to consolidate itself with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of material advances and,</v>

453
00:26:31.351 --> 00:26:31.861
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

454
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and guide of intellectual growth,</v>

455
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.690
<v Speaker 2>which is what has become so dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the last three decades.</v>

456
00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:40.524
<v Speaker 2>A kind of hyper individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is unconstrained by any </v>

457
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:45.870
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

458
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.893
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what has been propagated and </v>

459
00:26:50.981 --> 00:26:54.110
<v Speaker 2>also swallowed whole by large numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

460
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.980
<v Speaker 2>which has really frayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many social sorted out at ds,</v>

461
00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.113
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of really destroyed I imagination </v>

462
00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:05.320
<v Speaker 2>in some crucial ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

463
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.330
<v Speaker 2>whole ways of acting in the world upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world has been lost to us because of</v>

464
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 2>this obsession with individualism.</v>

465
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.873
<v Speaker 1>somewhat frame this conversation within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is an imposition of </v>

467
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:25.800
<v Speaker 1>progressivism on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

468
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.810
<v Speaker 1>but on former colonized nations by </v>
<v Speaker 1>former colonial nations,</v>

469
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.010
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

470
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.380
<v Speaker 1>competing at low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less powerful,</v>

471
00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but I think still interesting story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the raw and,</v>

472
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.243
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps a component of Orient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient Elysium is the romanticization </v>

473
00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that also comes from sort of I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they like,</v>

474
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.663
<v Speaker 1>cause for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting you as an Indian man that grew </v>

475
00:27:52.641 --> 00:27:54.980
<v Speaker 1>up in a small town and me as a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

476
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.883
<v Speaker 1>and my body is smothered in tattoos from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your great scriptures of figures and </v>

477
00:28:02.031 --> 00:28:05.210
<v Speaker 1>icons and gods from your scriptures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cause I write literal text.</v>

478
00:28:05.211 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

479
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Love smothered in Bloody Sanskrit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Krishna's here connect.</v>

480
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.420
<v Speaker 1>She's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shakras are there.</v>

481
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was smothered in all this stuff.</v>

482
00:28:13.641 --> 00:28:15.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's this sort of like this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

483
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.173
<v Speaker 1>the other component of orientalism is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>software Western fetishization of a and </v>

484
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 1>possibly a reductively of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

485
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>of Hindu ideology or vedic knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so no,</v>

486
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.973
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that there is a genuine</v>
<v Speaker 1>value that can be useful in a sort of </v>

487
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.593
<v Speaker 1>postmodern?</v>

488
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.303
<v Speaker 2>Far Too much easy mockery and criticism </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who look to all the cultures </v>

489
00:28:46.451 --> 00:28:48.100
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ancient philosophies,</v>

490
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.110
<v Speaker 2>whether in Asia or elsewhere in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

491
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.953
<v Speaker 2>or Latin America or the Americas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what they are looking for is an </v>

492
00:28:57.621 --> 00:28:58.454
<v Speaker 2>alternative to a way of being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a civilization that feels too much </v>

493
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:07.010
<v Speaker 2>like a trap to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

494
00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:07.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the 60s or went out to places </v>

495
00:29:10.371 --> 00:29:14.300
<v Speaker 2>like India and joined various </v>
<v Speaker 2>countercultural moments,</v>

496
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 2>most famously the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know there was so many,</v>

497
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:18.114
<v Speaker 2>they were literally hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people who went out there </v>

498
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.463
<v Speaker 2>looking for an alternative to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So less mechanical society that they </v>

499
00:29:28.511 --> 00:29:29.344
<v Speaker 2>were living in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was at that time in the 1960s </v>

500
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 2>engaged in a catastrophic violent war in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam and indies elsewhere.</v>

501
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So there was a lot of disillusionment </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

502
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.063
<v Speaker 2>which made people look for some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a spiritual and moral possibility </v>

503
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.343
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>

504
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think that impulse is important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that impulse,</v>

505
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.600
<v Speaker 2>which can mislead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did mislead a lot of people,</v>

506
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into joining all kinds of crazy sex,</v>

507
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being cornered by various gurus who were</v>

508
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:05.820
<v Speaker 2>just waiting for these gullible people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to show up.</v>

509
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.203
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's really important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why these people went out </v>

510
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:15.781
<v Speaker 2>there and that it's also important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that there is a lot of value.</v>

511
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.313
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many things of value in these </v>

512
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 2>traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are these,</v>

513
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:22.504
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how human beings lived for </v>

514
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:24.664
<v Speaker 2>centuries and centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would be foolish to discard the </v>

515
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:29.950
<v Speaker 2>wisdom contained in those traditions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophies.</v>

516
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.220
<v Speaker 1>How do we utilize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you imagine?</v>

517
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518
00:30:35.571 --> 00:30:36.404
<v Speaker 1>of course this is wisdom premised on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very different time on different </v>

519
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.880
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sense that morally and spiritually</v>

520
00:30:46.881 --> 00:30:47.714
<v Speaker 1>there's a value in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can it like in defiance of the essence </v>

521
00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:52.544
<v Speaker 1>of secularism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do these spiritual models have </v>

522
00:30:56.151 --> 00:31:01.151
<v Speaker 1>information that ought be utilized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of new social systems?</v>

523
00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:02.450
<v Speaker 1>In your opinion?</v>

524
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like the Dalai Lama,</v>

525
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I rate very highly,</v>

526
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.260
<v Speaker 2>who is a Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he goes around the world,</v>

527
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 2>he insists that he's not really talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Buddhism.</v>

528
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.780
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance of compassion.</v>

529
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.200
<v Speaker 2>So He's coming from an ancient religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

530
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.670
<v Speaker 2>He's completely immersed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's using that language,</v>

531
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 2>but he's not saying that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a Buddhist.</v>

532
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.833
<v Speaker 2>You have to convert to my way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying these are some of the </v>

533
00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:39.501
<v Speaker 2>principles outlined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embraced by human beings a long time ago</v>

534
00:31:40.071 --> 00:31:40.904
<v Speaker 2>and since then followed by hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people and they have been </v>

535
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.803
<v Speaker 2>hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hugely important and making possible </v>

536
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.033
<v Speaker 2>contented lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to think about this as an </v>

537
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:53.624
<v Speaker 2>alternative to these stress stouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerable lives that you're leading </v>

538
00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:00.254
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is causing all kinds of </v>

539
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.640
<v Speaker 2>psychological disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you know,</v>

540
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:09.560
<v Speaker 2>when you start thinking about it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these pragmatic ways,</v>

541
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>when you shed this baggage of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition or spiritual tradition,</v>

542
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.983
<v Speaker 2>when again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about the basic building </v>

543
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:23.550
<v Speaker 2>blocks of human society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion and solidarity,</v>

544
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Speaker 2>those resources you can find in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different religious traditions including</v>

545
00:32:29.101 --> 00:32:29.790
<v Speaker 2>those in the west.</v>

546
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important too to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it.</v>

547
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Western Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

548
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 2>is it cell full of those vital </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions.</v>

549
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about the basic building</v>

550
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v Speaker 1>blocks of human society or so of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the basic building blocks </v>

551
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:48.770
<v Speaker 1>of a human being and a the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these energies,</v>

552
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:53.771
<v Speaker 1>these Schumer's these components of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being include compassion,</v>

553
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 1>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

554
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:57.610
<v Speaker 1>togetherness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union Union and yearning,</v>

555
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 1>at least for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the last few things I mentioned,</v>

556
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 1>then these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

557
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.053
<v Speaker 1>perhaps I favorable resource to under </v>
<v Speaker 1>route raw underwrite our social systems </v>

558
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.823
<v Speaker 1>compared to these sort of individualism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has become rampant and is leading </v>

559
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:14.864
<v Speaker 1>into deterioration is something I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up several times in this </v>

560
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what you think about it</v>

561
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:23.981
<v Speaker 1>in the moment prior to Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence from Britain,</v>

562
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.053
<v Speaker 1>Gandy said that there's no point in us </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing the British merely to emulate </v>

563
00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 1>them and to maintain their systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware.</v>

564
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.043
<v Speaker 1>And as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he spoke sort of that 60 70 </v>

565
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 1>years ago whenever it was said like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

566
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>you know that this is a country of </v>
<v Speaker 1>70,000</v>

567
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:39.170
<v Speaker 1>villages.</v>

568
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.003
<v Speaker 1>All of them should be the PA perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>into dependent but autonomous and free </v>

569
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:46.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he set that sort of like that,</v>

570
00:33:46.661 --> 00:33:47.494
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was talked in a way about sort of </v>

571
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 1>a decentralized social system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also talks about,</v>

572
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.420
<v Speaker 1>and I've not mentioned this is march </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

573
00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:56.254
<v Speaker 1>but he said people will have to to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree let go of their need for </v>

574
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:02.240
<v Speaker 1>commodification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There need to consume.</v>

575
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:07.241
<v Speaker 1>And it seems sort of again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a as ear really perspicacious to</v>

576
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:08.354
<v Speaker 1>hear someone talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be obsessed with your iphone </v>

577
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.440
<v Speaker 1>for half a century prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of technology being available.</v>

578
00:34:15.441 --> 00:34:19.610
<v Speaker 1>But it seemed to me very pertinent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is that we have to let go.</v>

579
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:20.444
<v Speaker 1>This a narrative of progressivism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps coming up is aligned to the </v>

580
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:25.934
<v Speaker 1>liberal idea of individual freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is aligned to consuming to make </v>

581
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 1>yourself happy and at some point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rubber meets the road,</v>

582
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 1>individual human beings like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said earlier,</v>

583
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:39.110
<v Speaker 1>we are sort of prisoners of comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to the privileges that the last</v>

584
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:42.630
<v Speaker 1>2030 years is afforded us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point does it,</v>

585
00:34:42.631 --> 00:34:43.464
<v Speaker 1>it boils down to us saying we've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have less stuff and we've got to </v>

586
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:48.990
<v Speaker 1>let go of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not working for us.</v>

587
00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And that might be a component of </v>
<v Speaker 1>building different kinds of societies.</v>

588
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.671
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

589
00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:55.151
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:34:55.151 --> 00:34:55.984
<v Speaker 2>socialism for a long time carried many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the impulses leftover from faded </v>

591
00:35:03.111 --> 00:35:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Christianity feeling of compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

592
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.940
<v Speaker 2>charity justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

593
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.600
<v Speaker 2>When social socialism ones realized in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain countries,</v>

594
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.673
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because socialism became all about </v>

595
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.850
<v Speaker 2>material growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>material progress,</v>

596
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.330
<v Speaker 2>these values were systematically </v>
<v Speaker 2>disregarded.</v>

597
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.710
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's really important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>marry socialist ideas,</v>

598
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.590
<v Speaker 2>primarily those of compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>

599
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.160
<v Speaker 2>justice to this regard for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

600
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.233
<v Speaker 2>Nature recognition of kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gandhi had very early on in the 1920s </v>

601
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:40.651
<v Speaker 2>and thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

602
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:41.484
<v Speaker 2>he was early figure of the green </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that the earth does not have </v>

603
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.760
<v Speaker 2>enough resources to fulfill all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy desires we have for,</v>

604
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadgets failed or amenities for life </v>

605
00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.603
<v Speaker 2>that we have to learn and practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The virtue of renunciation is that that </v>

606
00:36:05.391 --> 00:36:07.040
<v Speaker 2>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important,</v>

607
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>value for the society we live in.</v>

608
00:36:09.891 --> 00:36:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not someone talking in a vacuum.</v>

609
00:36:13.341 --> 00:36:14.174
<v Speaker 2>This is someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an aspect of him that's </v>

610
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.603
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the one who has lived in three </v>

611
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:21.580
<v Speaker 2>continents before the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's lived in Africa,</v>

612
00:36:21.581 --> 00:36:23.560
<v Speaker 2>he's lived in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lived in Europe.</v>

613
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:28.570
<v Speaker 2>This is the man with a wide experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>of world that has been globalized during</v>

614
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:29.660
<v Speaker 2>his time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

615
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he understands that this model,</v>

616
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.490
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially it's premised on </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

617
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:36.783
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can see that because he's living </v>

618
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 2>under imperialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sees the,</v>

619
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

620
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 2>violence is at the core of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

621
00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:50.270
<v Speaker 2>And that is why India cannot afford to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow this path.</v>

622
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

623
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.773
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did say that we don't want to </v>

624
00:36:54.051 --> 00:36:55.460
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

625
00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>replace rule by rule of the Englishman </v>
<v Speaker 2>by English Raj.</v>

626
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to think again about what </v>

627
00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:06.284
<v Speaker 2>kind of society we want for ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>because following this model of and </v>

628
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.770
<v Speaker 2>growth consumption oriented growth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to lead us into an impasse.</v>

629
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.550
<v Speaker 1>This concealed violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:37:21.551 --> 00:37:22.211
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

631
00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:22.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

632
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.593
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of this model to conceal </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's means and its motives is something </v>

633
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 1>addressed by Marxist theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

634
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.063
<v Speaker 1>I suppose predicate it simply on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you can't have limitless </v>

635
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 1>growth if you've got limited resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

636
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.240
<v Speaker 1>this will not even in the end sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinically.</v>

637
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.223
<v Speaker 1>This will lead to crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So capitalism at its heart needs to </v>

638
00:37:48.221 --> 00:37:52.000
<v Speaker 1>conceal both its means and its motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

639
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that at its core there is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and like,</v>

640
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't care which is going to carry on</v>

641
00:37:57.071 --> 00:37:57.920
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

642
00:37:57.921 --> 00:37:58.754
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of a sort of a weird psychopathic </v>

643
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.980
<v Speaker 1>modus operandi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

644
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:05.803
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me that you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke of a kind of an emergent sense of </v>

645
00:38:10.311 --> 00:38:12.710
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the despair that we experienced as a</v>

646
00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:13.544
<v Speaker 1>result of this nihilism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because we are beginning to </v>

647
00:38:17.861 --> 00:38:20.800
<v Speaker 1>experience while continue while we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue,</v>

648
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.030
<v Speaker 1>while the lie is sort of still sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>propped up with a by quantitative easing</v>

649
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.840
<v Speaker 1>or are compliant media new iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>upgrade.</v>

650
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

651
00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:30.844
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I take them whenever they're </v>

652
00:38:31.451 --> 00:38:32.284
<v Speaker 1>offered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

653
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the one I found 10 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these continues to be concealed.</v>

655
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.193
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

656
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what I'm asking I suppose</v>

657
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.993
<v Speaker 1>is La,</v>

658
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.020
<v Speaker 2>where will,</v>

659
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.260
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

660
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saying that it will lead to impasse,</v>

661
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's perhaps likely that this rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>will lead somewhere</v>

662
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.320
<v Speaker 2>darker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

663
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 2>where do you envisage it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

664
00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:56.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many ways the solutions to many of </v>

665
00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:03.000
<v Speaker 2>the problems that exist today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political problems,</v>

666
00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>economic problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

667
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.053
<v Speaker 2>dysfunction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pretty obvious if you're diagnosed </v>

668
00:39:08.161 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 2>the problem correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems,</v>

669
00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

670
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.070
<v Speaker 2>the prescriptions of the solutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

671
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.960
<v Speaker 2>would emerge naturally from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem really is the,</v>

672
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.183
<v Speaker 2>whether anyone or any party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any movement has the political will to </v>

673
00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The establishment at present,</v>

674
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.640
<v Speaker 2>whether in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

675
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:25.474
<v Speaker 2>in Europe or in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not think it's capable of charting </v>

676
00:39:29.641 --> 00:39:33.330
<v Speaker 2>a new path of leading us out of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>impasse.</v>

677
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Marsha depends on social movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on political movements,</v>

678
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.340
<v Speaker 2>on the energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dynamism,</v>

679
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.213
<v Speaker 2>dynamism of young people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>entering public life for the first time </v>

680
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 2>with new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with no prejudices,</v>

681
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.080
<v Speaker 2>no fantasies about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their imperialist past and,</v>

682
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:53.611
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

683
00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

684
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 2>and what their ancestors achieved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>second world war and so on.</v>

685
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And these are people that we should look</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>

686
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my generation was a,</v>

687
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 2>was a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

688
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in now,</v>

689
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

690
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 2>approaching my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

691
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

692
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.023
<v Speaker 2>late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel that my generation was too </v>

693
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:13.504
<v Speaker 2>much in thrall to these notions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal progress and growth that </v>

694
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:23.821
<v Speaker 2>started to be globalized back off back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the late eighties,</v>

695
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.793
<v Speaker 2>early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a generation that has not been </v>

696
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:34.580
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated by this kind of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

697
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.400
<v Speaker 2>that's very experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is different,</v>

698
00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.660
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very distinctly,</v>

699
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.673
<v Speaker 2>is one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should never underestimate the power of </v>

700
00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:46.010
<v Speaker 2>a generation remake or young generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>to remake the world.</v>

701
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

702
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Curious the identity and fluidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a PA to be sort of a determining </v>

703
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 1>component of the younger generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they don't want to be labeled.</v>

704
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 1>They either around sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

705
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:01.594
<v Speaker 1>There is a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a sort of a new fluidity that </v>

706
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:08.851
<v Speaker 1>bodes well for transitioning and change </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a social and political.</v>

707
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

708
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.830
<v Speaker 2>all our rigid categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

710
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.930
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine for instance.</v>

711
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been experiencing now for the last</v>

712
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 2>few months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of explosion of,</v>

713
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:24.483
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories about this whole culture of </v>

714
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 2>oppression that has existed in the heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the modern world.</v>

715
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.563
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that used to be blamed </v>

716
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 2>exclusively on Islam or religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oppression of women,</v>

717
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:40.450
<v Speaker 2>the exploitation of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we see a,</v>

718
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

719
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.953
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pathology existing in the </v>

720
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.760
<v Speaker 2>citadel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

721
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within corporate cultures.</v>

722
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:53.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what it is telling us that,</v>

723
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of this oppression is systemic.</v>

724
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

725
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:03.220
<v Speaker 2>it's premised on these rigid separations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

726
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.530
<v Speaker 2>of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mescaline roles,</v>

727
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.383
<v Speaker 2>feminine rules and this identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>blurring and fluidity that we sue today </v>

728
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.970
<v Speaker 2>is an attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's deliberate or not,</v>

729
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.433
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly a very admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is trying to transcend these categories </v>

730
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 2>that actually create oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions for,</v>

731
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 2>for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people.</v>

732
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 1>That's brilliant insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

733
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.870
<v Speaker 1>That means to ask you a few more sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

734
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that relate to your work and </v>

735
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.680
<v Speaker 1>sort of bring us to this pretty salient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

736
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.280
<v Speaker 1>we touched on the recent recent amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying it correct?</v>

737
00:42:42.281 --> 00:42:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

738
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.190
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

739
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.103
<v Speaker 1>like can you unpack the kick card aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that day to turn the kicker God used </v>

740
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and how it relates to terrorism?</v>

741
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.983
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Kierkegaard [inaudible] was </v>

743
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:03.311
<v Speaker 2>something that emerges when individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are made to think that they are equal.</v>

744
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.143
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did the same time they confront the </v>

745
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:17.360
<v Speaker 2>fact the brute fact structural </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>

746
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:23.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's this collision between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that you're equal,</v>

747
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:28.140
<v Speaker 2>that you all have the same opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are in the same social level,</v>

748
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 2>and then you encounter the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are much better off,</v>

749
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.110
<v Speaker 2>that there are structural injustices at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

750
00:43:38.111 --> 00:43:43.111
<v Speaker 2>historical injustices at work that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people more privileged than others.</v>

751
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:46.903
<v Speaker 2>He diagnosed this as a problem peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>to modern society because societies in </v>

752
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>the past did not uphold the quality as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ideal or as a value.</v>

753
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 2>These are hierarchical societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

754
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] know they did not think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about instituting equality as an idea.</v>

755
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>It's more than society that thinks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality as a central idea,</v>

756
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.873
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the process of </v>

757
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.803
<v Speaker 2>industrialization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of all these other things that </v>

758
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:18.074
<v Speaker 2>start to happen in the 19th century and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick your God is writing in the 19th </v>

759
00:44:20.271 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mid 19th century,</v>

760
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:22.903
<v Speaker 2>he can see that there's a contradiction </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening up between the promise of </v>

761
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:31.631
<v Speaker 2>equality between the promise of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the growth of institutions that deny</v>

762
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 2>people equality and freedom.</v>

763
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:34.763
<v Speaker 2>And it's sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That denial that the feeling of the </v>

764
00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:40.170
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] germinates Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

765
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So he identified a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction.</v>

766
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

767
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.173
<v Speaker 2>Sorry drew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So although he did not use the word </v>

768
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 2>resulting more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

769
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.371
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

770
00:44:49.371 --> 00:44:50.204
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did point to some central </v>

771
00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:53.294
<v Speaker 2>contradictions in the modern project </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we are trying to achieve will </v>

772
00:44:58.691 --> 00:44:59.524
<v Speaker 2>not be achieved because there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something just intrinsically </v>

773
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.160
<v Speaker 2>contradictory about pursuing equality in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society where competition,</v>

774
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.140
<v Speaker 2>vanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imitation,</v>

775
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 2>our values and ideas,</v>

776
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.683
<v Speaker 1>these values I find personally very </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing and I experienced all of them </v>

777
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.163
<v Speaker 1>quite deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vanity plays a big role in my life and </v>

778
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:29.574
<v Speaker 1>has done and it's something I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of and I'm trying to diminish his </v>

779
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:32.634
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competition is a not good feeling to </v>

780
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:37.380
<v Speaker 1>feel I'm not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be better than these people,</v>

781
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.360
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these models.</v>

782
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:40.194
<v Speaker 1>I expect that when I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause one of the reason I started doing </v>

783
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:43.014
<v Speaker 1>this a podcast is because I go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as university in London doing a </v>

784
00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:49.010
<v Speaker 1>degree in religion in global politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

785
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the moment I'm doing a module of </v>

786
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 1>a sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots of the traditions of yoga.</v>

787
00:45:54.571 --> 00:45:56.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's looking at a lot of vedic texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pan,</v>

788
00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 1>upanishads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

789
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.973
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I'm listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures or reason about it and I sort </v>

790
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 1>of have been doing this generally across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course,</v>

791
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what does this matter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean now?</v>

792
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.710
<v Speaker 1>What do these values mean to me right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in this room,</v>

793
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this planet,</v>

794
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.490
<v Speaker 1>in these systems right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get it.</v>

795
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Cause I can see the impact of vanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the failure of narcissism,</v>

796
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:18.893
<v Speaker 1>I'm experiencing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm experiencing the failure of </v>

797
00:46:20.521 --> 00:46:21.354
<v Speaker 1>consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing the way that I'm inhibited </v>

798
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.563
<v Speaker 1>and limited by these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A moment ago you said like if you </v>

799
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:33.771
<v Speaker 1>correctly diagnose the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the prescription becomes obvious,</v>

800
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty cool catch me </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

801
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I reckon you should start pushing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

802
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.153
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

803
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.593
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you diagnose as the problem and </v>

804
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.363
<v Speaker 1>is it like with all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexities and on the scale that we </v>

805
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 1>now live with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

806
00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:49.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glide,</v>

807
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:50.454
<v Speaker 1>but globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you regard it as pejorative as </v>

808
00:46:53.461 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it now generally is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or positives,</v>

809
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it was just a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago.</v>

810
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.183
<v Speaker 1>How do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does one come up with a central </v>

811
00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:03.370
<v Speaker 1>universal solutions too?</v>

812
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probably isn't a central university </v>

813
00:47:05.261 --> 00:47:06.560
<v Speaker 2>tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think uh,</v>

814
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.940
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a mistake to look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>central university,</v>

815
00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:10.774
<v Speaker 2>the solution right now because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem you could say was in thinking </v>

816
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.900
<v Speaker 2>that there is a universal model of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

817
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:25.470
<v Speaker 2>The fact that all of us wherever we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to device ideas,</v>

818
00:47:25.931 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 2>solutions for our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nectar too.</v>

819
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real experience of her circumstances off</v>

820
00:47:34.281 --> 00:47:36.650
<v Speaker 2>the actual physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical,</v>

821
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.513
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical conditions that'd be inherit </v>

822
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.700
<v Speaker 2>this can only mean forms of devolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decentralization.</v>

823
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

824
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the,</v>

825
00:47:46.171 --> 00:47:49.280
<v Speaker 2>the implications of this diagnosis in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

826
00:47:49.281 --> 00:47:50.690
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many different realms.</v>

827
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

828
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.670
<v Speaker 2>politically we have to think more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>decentralization.</v>

829
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.190
<v Speaker 2>We have to think about people being </v>
<v Speaker 2>empowered,</v>

830
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.820
<v Speaker 2>people feeling that they are in control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their lives.</v>

831
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:06.160
<v Speaker 1>So what do you make of people like on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left that say that without some form</v>

832
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:11.161
<v Speaker 1>of dominant state power there will the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

833
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:11.951
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

834
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:12.784
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of anarchy is a pejorative or </v>

835
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>negative state emerges like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:18.484
<v Speaker 1>when I sort of say look cause for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while and some of these conversations </v>

837
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.064
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the like are our </v>

838
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 1>requirements and our needs are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse.</v>

839
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 1>We need the power to be as close as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to the people that are affected</v>

840
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 1>by that power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People should run their own workplaces,</v>

841
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.420
<v Speaker 1>their own hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own schools,</v>

842
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:34.150
<v Speaker 1>their own communities and power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be devolved,</v>

843
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:38.430
<v Speaker 1>decentralized wherever possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the feedback I've had from sofa</v>

844
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.313
<v Speaker 1>as suppose in know traditional leftist </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and some people that are very </v>

845
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.340
<v Speaker 1>much respect and admire is that without </v>
<v Speaker 1>some authority,</v>

846
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 1>some sort of state or far even without </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of central power,</v>

847
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 1>these projects we'll foul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you send it?</v>

848
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I can understand that concern because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

849
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:54.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has been said over and </v>

850
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:57.964
<v Speaker 2>over again in the last 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years of new liberalism is that the </v>

851
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:01.054
<v Speaker 2>state needs to step back and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially society be governed </v>

852
00:49:05.611 --> 00:49:07.440
<v Speaker 2>according to market principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

853
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.753
<v Speaker 2>So there is very good reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicious of that argument which wants </v>

854
00:49:12.991 --> 00:49:17.991
<v Speaker 2>to roll back the role of government in </v>
<v Speaker 2>protecting the weak and the vulnerable.</v>

855
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.133
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

856
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 2>And giving ceding power to market forces</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know who benefits from,</v>

857
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 2>from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the free play of market forces.</v>

858
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.263
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a history has shown repeatedly </v>

859
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 2>that states when invested with too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

860
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.530
<v Speaker 2>toning into oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impersonal bureaucracies,</v>

861
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.800
<v Speaker 2>that is the experience of many </v>
<v Speaker 2>communists states,</v>

862
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 2>eastern European states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have to be careful.</v>

863
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:47.914
<v Speaker 2>We have to strike a balance between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state that is responsive to it's </v>

864
00:49:51.871 --> 00:49:52.704
<v Speaker 2>citizens that doesn't a choir and a not </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas' life that doesn't stop living </v>

865
00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:03.240
<v Speaker 2>for itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to,</v>

866
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.450
<v Speaker 2>there has to be a role for the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

867
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.840
<v Speaker 2>citizens have to feel that the decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are taking,</v>

868
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:17.370
<v Speaker 2>the people they are choosing as their </v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives are responsive to them.</v>

869
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.373
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they are in a politically </v>

870
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:22.363
<v Speaker 2>functional society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we have today is a deeply </v>

871
00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:28.620
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional political society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

872
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidently.</v>

873
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of like a new heroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the left's,</v>

874
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Corbyn,</v>

875
00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:38.934
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders that know if that's </v>

876
00:50:40.381 --> 00:50:41.214
<v Speaker 1>relevant anymore in America or would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next election cycle if that's </v>

877
00:50:44.101 --> 00:50:45.540
<v Speaker 1>already something that's over and done </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

878
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that within the conditions,</v>

879
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.500
<v Speaker 1>the democratic conditions as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently find them,</v>

880
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.440
<v Speaker 1>that they would be able to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's interest?</v>

881
00:50:55.441 --> 00:50:56.950
<v Speaker 1>This is recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jeremy Corbyn,</v>

882
00:50:56.951 --> 00:50:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Sam Morgan Stanley should be afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:50:58.861 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

884
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.820
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to coin the author,</v>

885
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.320
<v Speaker 1>use the name of the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the backs,</v>

886
00:51:04.321 --> 00:51:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Corbyn genuine momentum in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction?</v>

887
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that with within democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we have it in this country,</v>

888
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:11.323
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would be empowered to take </v>

889
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.850
<v Speaker 1>action in that direction?</v>

890
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm more interested in,</v>

891
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.630
<v Speaker 2>in the movements then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in actual personalities.</v>

892
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's remarkable that within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few months,</v>

893
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.023
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive movements consisting largely of </v>

894
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.713
<v Speaker 2>very young people politicize young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people came together and became a huge </v>

895
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:34.574
<v Speaker 2>presence in British politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is more important than you </v>

896
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:39.101
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

897
00:51:39.101 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the play of individuals.</v>

898
00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.193
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corban is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an important figure in that he was </v>

900
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 2>the one who crystallize a popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

901
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.870
<v Speaker 2>a feeling that was not being articulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by certainly not the press,</v>

902
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.383
<v Speaker 2>not by a commentators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He managed to recognize that a lot of </v>

903
00:51:56.331 --> 00:51:58.940
<v Speaker 2>people in this country for ready for </v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

904
00:51:58.941 --> 00:52:02.780
<v Speaker 2>for new ways of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now whether he is politically successful</v>

905
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:05.630
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the important thing is that he's already</v>

906
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:06.464
<v Speaker 2>created a movement is already affected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dramatic shifts in how people think </v>

907
00:52:11.771 --> 00:52:12.604
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

908
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.560
<v Speaker 1>what should be done here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

909
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>But part of my question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pancake is what within democracy,</v>

910
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:24.010
<v Speaker 1>as we currently experience it as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists now,</v>

911
00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:29.070
<v Speaker 1>would a political party led by Corbyn or</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone of a similar sensibility be able</v>

912
00:52:29.561 --> 00:52:30.394
<v Speaker 1>to enact the will of the people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or would there be too much bureaucratic </v>

913
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:33.723
<v Speaker 1>and systemic resistance and eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does the state with the have </v>

914
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:45.660
<v Speaker 1>sufficient power to confront eg </v>
<v Speaker 1>transnational corporations.</v>

915
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.293
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds are stacked against 'em anyone </v>

916
00:52:48.961 --> 00:52:49.794
<v Speaker 2>trying to affect any movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any individual trying to affect radical </v>

917
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:59.240
<v Speaker 2>change in this society especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very conservative society,</v>

918
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where all kinds of ancient powers are </v>

919
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:05.560
<v Speaker 2>entrenched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

920
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Unlike most societies in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which experience revolution experienced,</v>

921
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.023
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of national upheaval that's </v>

922
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.350
<v Speaker 2>overturn the old order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce new elements,</v>

923
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:23.940
<v Speaker 2>we have to recognize that Britain never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really had a revolution.</v>

924
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So Brandon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty unique.</v>

925
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Think that's extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

926
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:28.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's singular.</v>

927
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Russia had one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France has a American side one.</v>

928
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 2>What did you watch Germany's then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure of the Second World War?</v>

929
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:35.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Jones went through all kinds of </v>

930
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:37.471
<v Speaker 2>traumas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

931
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 2>even even before the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first one went very good.</v>

932
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

933
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:43.603
<v Speaker 2>they had to unify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to sort of create a nation </v>

934
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 2>state in the first place in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

935
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 2>in the 19th century.</v>

936
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Britain is really unique and one reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>British politics has been so different </v>

937
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:55.314
<v Speaker 2>from everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What has remained conservative for such </v>

938
00:53:57.721 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 2>a long time and why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 2>a certain kind of English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upper class landowning aristocracy still</v>

940
00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:11.091
<v Speaker 2>exercises enormous influence here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is unprecedented,</v>

941
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.923
<v Speaker 2>really unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the entire world you can't think </v>

942
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:17.154
<v Speaker 2>of any other country with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional power invested in </v>

943
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.180
<v Speaker 2>traditional elites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fascinating.</v>

944
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:32.240
<v Speaker 2>So I say we're in a unique society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why someone,</v>

945
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

946
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.133
<v Speaker 2>venturing on a radical project of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political economic transformation is up </v>

947
00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

948
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:43.970
<v Speaker 2>there's no point in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

949
00:54:43.971 --> 00:54:44.570
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:45.403
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being overly optimistic by the one has </v>

951
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>to recognize that there are formidable </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>

952
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.163
<v Speaker 2>Head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the role of religion </v>

953
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.123
<v Speaker 2>may be as if not more important as </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics as we understand it in any </v>

954
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 2>significant social change?</v>

955
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about Britain,</v>

956
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:08.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of religion has been declining </v>

957
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:12.323
<v Speaker 2>so dramatically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so rapidly that one can't really think </v>

958
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:16.014
<v Speaker 2>of it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of political factor really </v>

959
00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:19.674
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religion remains a alive in other </v>

960
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:25.014
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately once religion is </v>

961
00:55:27.151 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 2>mobilized as a political force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beny turns into ideology,</v>

962
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 2>then it moves away from what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier.</v>

963
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 2>This belief in a transcendental </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority,</v>

964
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.790
<v Speaker 2>which in many ways is a source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>constellation,</v>

965
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:43.700
<v Speaker 2>a source of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

966
00:55:43.701 --> 00:55:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

967
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:44.853
<v Speaker 2>it pacifies many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes them more kind and </v>

968
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:48.894
<v Speaker 2>compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when religion is used as an </v>

969
00:55:50.641 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a way of mobilizing people,</v>

970
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.473
<v Speaker 2>it is inevitably a recipe for conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then what people want to do is </v>

971
00:55:59.221 --> 00:55:59.911
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

972
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 2>this community or this particular group </v>
<v Speaker 2>does not belong.</v>

973
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.513
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is isn't conflict and violence </v>

974
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.060
<v Speaker 2>isn't conflict.</v>

975
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Certainly in violence regrettably and </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary component in radical change,</v>

976
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.560
<v Speaker 2>probably not violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

977
00:56:19.561 --> 00:56:20.394
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are instances of societies which </v>

978
00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.553
<v Speaker 2>have recovered from great violence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild themselves through largely </v>

979
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 2>nonviolent means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has been conflict.</v>

980
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Inevitably there'll be conflict because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old guard is,</v>

981
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.341
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

982
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 2>is not going to let go of it's Baba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

983
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:40.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power never really concedes anything </v>

984
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.293
<v Speaker 2>unless you make stern demands on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is inevitably going to be </v>

985
00:56:48.711 --> 00:56:51.110
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But violence,</v>

986
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:52.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think violence can unleash a cycle </v>

987
00:56:56.130 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 2>where we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.373
<v Speaker 2>continue to employ violent means to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue your ends and inflict more on </v>

989
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:09.660
<v Speaker 2>more damage on the social fabric of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

990
00:57:09.661 --> 00:57:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

991
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been the experience of many </v>

992
00:57:11.821 --> 00:57:12.654
<v Speaker 2>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bishop hired violent revolutions and </v>

993
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:16.493
<v Speaker 2>undermine themselves and took a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for them to recover from that kind </v>

994
00:57:20.821 --> 00:57:22.410
<v Speaker 2>of prime of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

995
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Nonviolence as a method for protest for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

996
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:29.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about sort of the </v>

997
00:57:30.211 --> 00:57:31.810
<v Speaker 1>old guard and the resistance of the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

998
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 1>you can see that there's these </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenched,</v>

999
00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 1>and you said ancient powers in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country you referring to,</v>

1000
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:40.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see sort of even modern or authority</v>

1001
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.460
<v Speaker 1>that refuses to yield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1002
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.930
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

1003
00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:46.764
<v Speaker 1>you said like the last time there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge civil unrest or like are around </v>

1004
00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:51.954
<v Speaker 1>identity politics around sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>empowerment of you for at the Marne for </v>

1005
00:57:55.501 --> 00:58:00.501
<v Speaker 1>change different ideas was the 60s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw by the nonviolence huge component</v>

1006
00:58:01.531 --> 00:58:05.160
<v Speaker 1>of that I suppose between in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it would probably because of the</v>

1007
00:58:05.161 --> 00:58:10.161
<v Speaker 1>infusion of sort of different ae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern mystic or to Luther King and the</v>

1008
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.270
<v Speaker 1>influence on Martin Luther King of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandy.</v>

1009
00:58:12.271 --> 00:58:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Very direct and explicit and expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1010
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:16.723
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose because it was being </v>

1011
00:58:17.401 --> 00:58:18.234
<v Speaker 1>counter post with such obvious domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in the United States against </v>

1012
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>the African American population in </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence on the young men and women that</v>

1013
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:29.760
<v Speaker 1>have incentive Vietnam to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose it seemed like an eh,</v>

1014
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.990
<v Speaker 1>evident and obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it though,</v>

1015
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1016
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you can envisage mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements towards decentralization.</v>

1017
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 1>There's something sort of contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1018
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:46.450
<v Speaker 1>but that people coming together </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving solidarity to demand the right</v>

1019
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:50.830
<v Speaker 1>to be autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to demand the dismantling of centralized</v>

1020
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>interest institutions that prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people having real purchase,</v>

1021
00:58:53.981 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 1>real power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real purpose.</v>

1022
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are instances of,</v>

1023
00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:00.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements for decentralization,</v>

1024
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:02.330
<v Speaker 2>which turned into secessionist </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>

1025
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:05.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes inevitably such as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1026
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:06.283
<v Speaker 2>cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1028
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in Hong Kong for </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>

1029
00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.400
<v Speaker 2>they want the freedom to run their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>affairs.</v>

1030
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

1031
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:15.343
<v Speaker 2>you could argue that large numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Scotland want to be free of a </v>

1032
00:59:19.311 --> 00:59:24.311
<v Speaker 2>country that is hurtling a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a disaster spot too.</v>

1033
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.454
<v Speaker 2>It's brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now we see more cessationists </v>

1034
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.440
<v Speaker 2>tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.260
<v Speaker 2>which are a kind of replacement for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1036
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.050
<v Speaker 1>That means what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of breaking away from existing</v>

1037
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 1>nation state</v>

1038
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:46.910
<v Speaker 2>structures and forming an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereign nation state.</v>

1039
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:47.803
<v Speaker 2>Why it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't solve the problem of </v>

1040
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:50.683
<v Speaker 2>centralization</v>

1041
00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why,</v>

1042
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.333
<v Speaker 1>like under those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't brexit be regarded as quite a </v>

1043
00:59:54.181 --> 00:59:55.014
<v Speaker 1>positive thing if we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralization or do you see the </v>

1044
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.250
<v Speaker 1>European Union is largely benevolent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront,</v>

1045
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>in economics to be made from the left</v>

1046
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:07.210
<v Speaker 2>for Brexit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1047
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 2>I've always believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1048
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:10.930
<v Speaker 2>it was never made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody bothered to make it.</v>

1049
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>

1050
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain should exercise greater </v>

1051
01:00:16.601 --> 01:00:21.601
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty and should not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions made by mobile global capital.</v>

1052
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:24.943
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to understand the </v>

1053
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.103
<v Speaker 2>impulse behind these apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>kilometers phenomenal like brexit or </v>

1054
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:36.554
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially people really do </v>

1055
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>want to take back control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1056
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.190
<v Speaker 2>The people promising control to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to be at this point,</v>

1057
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.443
<v Speaker 2>demagogues core interested in expanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own power and those of their </v>

1058
01:00:52.771 --> 01:00:54.110
<v Speaker 2>cronies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1059
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.640
<v Speaker 2>This does not mean that the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the four tone,</v>

1060
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.320
<v Speaker 2>which was the idea of taking back </v>
<v Speaker 2>control is not hugely attractive numbers</v>

1061
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:06.783
<v Speaker 2>of people who really do genuinely want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take back into who do want to be </v>

1062
01:01:10.121 --> 01:01:10.954
<v Speaker 2>empowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do not want their lives to be </v>

1063
01:01:13.031 --> 01:01:16.990
<v Speaker 2>determined by the impersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract forces of,</v>

1064
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:20.080
<v Speaker 2>of capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do want to be repulsed,</v>

1065
01:01:20.081 --> 01:01:22.540
<v Speaker 2>decide their societies to be repleted </v>
<v Speaker 2>decides that,</v>

1066
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1067
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:23.531
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1068
01:01:23.531 --> 01:01:28.531
<v Speaker 2>and wants economic imperatives or indeed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imperatives of profit,</v>

1069
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:35.860
<v Speaker 2>corporate profits to override human </v>
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>

1070
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>human considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's,</v>

1071
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the far right or the devil Gawks,</v>

1072
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:47.360
<v Speaker 2>if they are the only ones channeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>this energy.</v>

1073
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two was their own ends.</v>

1074
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Then we end up with these in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations that we are in right now.</v>

1075
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.753
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very optimistic </v>

1076
01:01:57.531 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By don't mean a romantic analysis,</v>

1077
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's quite pragmatic and quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1078
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1079
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:04.523
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you were saying that if you </v>

1080
01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:07.784
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed the problem correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the prescription becomes obvious </v>

1081
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and if indeed we are living in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me quote you at the title,</v>

1082
01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of anger,</v>

1083
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>then compassion is necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription compassion for one another.</v>

1084
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.483
<v Speaker 1>both for honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a spiritual perspective and from a </v>

1086
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:25.824
<v Speaker 1>practical political perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've learned a great deal from </v>

1087
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>this conversation and I can envisage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really understood the story,</v>

1088
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>their philosophical story or historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative in ways that I haven't before </v>

1089
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>and it gave me cause for optimism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1090
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a person that saw brexit</v>

1091
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>is a wholly oh negative thing.</v>

1092
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the background I come from,</v>

1093
01:02:44.851 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I have a different attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1094
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Sort of the idea of what brexit might </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean and what people might have meant </v>

1095
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>when they said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that take back power,</v>

1096
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>take back control as an impulse needn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily be,</v>

1097
01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aimed at like,</v>

1098
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>because we hate these group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we hate that group of people.</v>

1099
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for explaining that </v>

1100
01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:06.271
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
