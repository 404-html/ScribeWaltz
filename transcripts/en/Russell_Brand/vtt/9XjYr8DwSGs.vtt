<v Speaker 1>which pioneers collaborative research </v>
<v Speaker 1>between philosophers,</v>

<v Speaker 1>linguistic knowledge,</v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotions,</v>

<v Speaker 1>taste and smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's appeared frequently on BBC </v>

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>radio including the writing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting of a four part series for the</v>

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>World Service called the mysteries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is also the wine columnist for</v>

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:34.614
<v Speaker 1>prospect magazine buries me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for coming on under </v>

11
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure to be here.</v>

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.833
<v Speaker 1>This is a big subject to discuss the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the senses and </v>

13
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sense is,</v>

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's these are the avenues to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience these represent who we are,</v>

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>but it seems from even a cursory </v>
<v Speaker 1>examination of your work,</v>

16
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>there is much misunderstanding about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework of the centers.</v>

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk to us a little about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>note?</v>

18
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I believe the I aristotle and idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about five.</v>

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think you're right.</v>

20
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>The sensors are our closest contact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we know where we are,</v>

22
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.273
<v Speaker 1>so we see things in front of us here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are in touch with people quite </v>

23
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.014
<v Speaker 1>literally taste and smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've for a long time thought we </v>

24
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>just have five senses that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're perceiving,</v>

25
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be either seeing or hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelling,</v>

26
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>tasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touching,</v>

27
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and we get that from aristotle who told </v>
<v Speaker 1>us we had these five senses.</v>

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's strange because if you talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists as I do know,</v>

29
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you ask him any senses of we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say anywhere between 22 and 33,</v>

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many senses.</v>

31
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of funny that we've given </v>
<v Speaker 1>up aristotle's view.</v>

32
00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>There were only five elements that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the whole of the world.</v>

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.591
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

34
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>we've rejected that physics has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it,</v>

35
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:04.674
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we have five senses </v>

36
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.954
<v Speaker 1>has prevailed and that's what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of when they think about </v>

37
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing I've just got five,</v>

38
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>we go out now and we ask people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

39
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they'll say five sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Lack of a safari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of think elephants,</v>

41
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>

42
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>So sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>

43
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing,</v>

44
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like bit beyond that,</v>

45
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

46
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>what is the panoply of sense neglected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.893
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of a few more sense of </v>

48
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that goes off,</v>

49
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you know all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the world starts spinning so it's</v>

50
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>going to affect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.723
<v Speaker 1>how your vision is behaving and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of balance is clearly important </v>

52
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>and on all the time if things are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are home,</v>

54
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>wants to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>try standing up and standing on one leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll wobble at all there.</v>

56
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now try closing your eyes and standing </v>

57
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>on one leg and you'll find it's much </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

58
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll know that your sense of balance </v>

59
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>is actually made up of three sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sight,</v>

60
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.653
<v Speaker 1>proprioception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is their sense we have of our own </v>

61
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>body from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you close your eyes,</v>

62
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:14.524
<v Speaker 1>now you know where your feet are on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands are without having to see them or </v>

63
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just feel where they are,</v>

64
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not by not by touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your proprioception.</v>

65
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That's knowing where your body is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

66
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>so that sense plus site plus these </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful little ear canals you have,</v>

67
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>so you've got ear canals pointing up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

68
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.003
<v Speaker 1>backwards and forwards and side to side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that tells you whether in a left </v>

69
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.354
<v Speaker 1>you're going up or whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>rushing forward and that combines with </v>

70
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>site and with a sense of your body to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you your sense of balance.</v>

71
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.293
<v Speaker 1>Am I lying down to my standing upright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My tipping over incredibly complex </v>

72
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms which boundary our sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self sensory deprivation.</v>

73
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Then I suppose is an interesting area </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it limits how we encode it.</v>

74
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.833
<v Speaker 1>Limits experience and if the sensory </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank or people that are </v>

75
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 1>blind from birth or don't have hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>

76
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>that that makes a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big difference.</v>

77
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.194
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the funny thing about the senses is </v>

78
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>there a little bit narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell you about the world,</v>

79
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but they also tell you about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're giving you a sense of how you</v>

80
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>are and what's going on with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even as we speak now,</v>

81
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>we are making sounds that have a echo </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the wall or from the table,</v>

82
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.963
<v Speaker 1>the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's telling us kind of how much </v>

83
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>noise we're producing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you've ever been,</v>

84
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you have as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

85
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an artist who works in sound,</v>

86
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.853
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been in an anechoic </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber where there's absolutely no </v>

87
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>echo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's frightening.</v>

88
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>You make assigned nothing comes back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually feel you're almost dead.</v>

89
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>There is a feeling that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've kind of landed in some weird,</v>

90
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.044
<v Speaker 1>strange world and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is that your brain is </v>

91
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the sounds you make in the world.</v>

92
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So as you walk along the pavement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously your feet are making a noise,</v>

93
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but you don't realize because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to it,</v>

94
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>that the brain has recording that </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed.</v>

95
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.073
<v Speaker 1>So colleagues of Mine and at Adora and </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliate Darwalla created these </v>

96
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>beautiful things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sonic shoes.</v>

97
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.493
<v Speaker 1>So you're wearing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing a kind of flip flop and </v>

98
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>their little sensors in it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending information up to headphones.</v>

99
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.373
<v Speaker 1>And as you walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make your footsteps sound </v>

100
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>louder,</v>

101
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.563
<v Speaker 1>or make them sound lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting thing is that </v>

102
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.174
<v Speaker 1>people's bodies behave completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently when you make the sign from </v>

103
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>their own feet signed heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they slouched the lean forward,</v>

104
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>they look as though it's a real effort.</v>

105
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.123
<v Speaker 1>And when you turn the frequency up high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just get this sort of light sign </v>

106
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>from the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People start leaping,</v>

107
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.504
<v Speaker 1>they actually start moving more happily </v>
<v Speaker 1>in space and you think that's </v>

108
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.704
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't realize that your brain and </v>

109
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>your body are trying to make everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit together.</v>

110
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>You're getting signals from signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from touch,</v>

111
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from smell,</v>

112
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.174
<v Speaker 1>from everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the brain is trying to put all that </v>

113
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>information together and to see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on out there.</v>

114
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>And how are things with me are </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing realities,</v>

115
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously determined by the senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are these studies,</v>

116
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

117
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that if you're asked to </v>

118
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>answer social political questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

119
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>should there be more or less immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your response may vary if there's a</v>

120
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>presence of an unpleasant smell in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room?</v>

121
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's interesting because smell </v>

123
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>is the most neglected sense and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked people,</v>

124
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if I asked you now and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

125
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>which sense of the five would you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

126
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to,</v>

127
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always say,</v>

128
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I give up sense of smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think not so important,</v>

129
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually fundamentally wrong.</v>

130
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Sense of smell is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the oldest one?</v>

131
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it.</v>

132
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and paramecium bacteria in our,</v>

133
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>in a jar have got receptors that respond</v>
<v Speaker 1>to orders.</v>

134
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So you know from the simplest animal up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell is important.</v>

135
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

136
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Why is smell important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's used to give you a sense of danger.</v>

138
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>If there's smoke predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are an animal,</v>

139
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.943
<v Speaker 1>we use it for attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that you are most </v>

140
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:55.361
<v Speaker 1>attracted to people who smell suggests </v>
<v Speaker 1>that their immune system is further away</v>

141
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>from yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>

142
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>we actually are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not attracted to people who smell is</v>

143
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>going to indicate that there are too </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to us genetically,</v>

144
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>that their immune system is too close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

145
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.543
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find yourself talking to </v>

146
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>somebody and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

147
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are very attractive,</v>

148
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 1>they're very lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful,</v>

149
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>but if they smell wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do,</v>

150
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do to over come </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

151
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.203
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand you might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you suddenly feel very attracted </v>

152
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>to and you wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could be love at first smell.</v>

153
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So your sense of smell is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about attraction.</v>

154
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's also about recognizing your kin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we give you a tee shirt,</v>

155
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>a that your infant has had on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will know it's yours.</v>

156
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>You will know that an equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:46.271
<v Speaker 1>the infant will be able to tell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mother there in front of it,</v>

158
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>from the sense of smell more so at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>than from sight.</v>

159
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And smell is also one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells us that everything is okay.</v>

160
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>So you no longer smell your own home.</v>

161
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else's homes got smell but </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours doesn't wise.</v>

162
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of funny right around this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unite,</v>

163
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>like while you're telling me they stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving you ideas.</v>

164
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Well and also reminding me of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

165
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember as I'm sure everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>does when you're a kid and you go around</v>

166
00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 2>other people's houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you smell it,</v>

167
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.020
<v Speaker 2>smell of fish fingers in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a beef burgers and you know,</v>

168
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.780
<v Speaker 1>you remember your friend's houses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a member.</v>

169
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:27.614
<v Speaker 1>You're relative sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how they smell and you and yet </v>

170
00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you think yours doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

171
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened is that you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to the smell of your own home.</v>

172
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You've switched that off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's</v>

173
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>gone entirely because if you go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your home and say,</v>

174
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's been in here,</v>

175
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.830
<v Speaker 1>someone's been smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or did I leave the rubbish out?</v>

176
00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're on it like that.</v>

177
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.313
<v Speaker 2>So we're touching upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose to the idea that the sensory </v>

178
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:57.021
<v Speaker 2>realm is establishing norms that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglect information once we've judged it</v>

179
00:09:59.061 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>to be standardized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

180
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.573
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in particular that's right with </v>

181
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:03.914
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might think that smells job </v>

182
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.240
<v Speaker 2>is to detect change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If nothing's changed,</v>

183
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.950
<v Speaker 2>leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

184
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.843
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why put the brainpower into maintaining </v>

185
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.790
<v Speaker 2>a permanent of factory landscape the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do with a visual landscape?</v>

186
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Why do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not checkers?</v>

187
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Still Beef Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beef burgers,</v>

188
00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:24.110
<v Speaker 2>still slightly pointless data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ketchup.</v>

189
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to bother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

190
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>But also remember that when we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about food,</v>

191
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.203
<v Speaker 1>your sense of smell is actually the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important sense for getting flavor from </v>

192
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

193
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.883
<v Speaker 2>so without smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they experience of gastronomy or </v>

194
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.110
<v Speaker 2>cuisines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is nothing.</v>

195
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.153
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

196
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
<v Speaker 1>all you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can get if you had your a nose </v>

197
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>clip on and we can put a pinch your nose</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly shot and try eating things.</v>

198
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>All your gets what the tongue provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

199
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.450
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sour,</v>

200
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.610
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>savory.</v>

201
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you can taste cherry,</v>

202
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 1>pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mango,</v>

203
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:01.244
<v Speaker 1>strawberry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have strawberry receptors on </v>

204
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.880
<v Speaker 1>your tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all coming from smell.</v>

205
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.043
<v Speaker 1>So if we took your sense of smell away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all lost and you often get </v>

206
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 1>patients going to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly an older age and they say,</v>

207
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I've lost my sense of taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a good doctor will say,</v>

208
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>put your tongue out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a bit of lemon juice,</v>

209
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>or here's a bit of salt to taste that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

210
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.830
<v Speaker 1>taste that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all I can taste,</v>

211
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.873
<v Speaker 1>and now they realize how much of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought was taste is actually due </v>

212
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:29.204
<v Speaker 1>to smell.</v>

213
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.770
<v Speaker 2>It also seems very that the sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>realm,</v>

214
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.633
<v Speaker 2>it is highly collaborative and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogous to what we're learning about </v>

215
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.950
<v Speaker 2>neurology and psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that it's not like this is the</v>

216
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:48.260
<v Speaker 2>bit of the brain that deals with fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the bit of the brain.</v>

217
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.213
<v Speaker 2>The centers are collaborating to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>a perception of reality in ways that </v>

218
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>with them we may have imagined they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really</v>

219
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.881
<v Speaker 1>are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

220
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 1>one thing is giving up five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more than five,</v>

222
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and the second thing is saying their </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses are massively interacting.</v>

223
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>You almost never have an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just in one sense modality.</v>

224
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.113
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arts is the place where we think </v>

225
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a gallery and you think,</v>

226
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just using my eyes,</v>

227
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>but in fact you're aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acoustics in the gallery.</v>

228
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you're in a very big room </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a high ceiling,</v>

229
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it's very different from being in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of small,</v>

230
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>tight space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the same painting.</v>

231
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>You're also aware of the smell of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gallery.</v>

232
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming back smell one of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>galleries where I grew up in Glasgow,</v>

233
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.453
<v Speaker 1>a art gallery and Museum Kelvin Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when it went in for a 40 million </v>

234
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 1>pound refit and it closed for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

235
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>the Glaswegians all said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't change the smell.</v>

236
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't change the smell because they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been there as kids.</v>

237
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>They had gone back as adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had taken their own kids and it was</v>

238
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>that familiar smell of old stone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>furniture Polish,</v>

239
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>which they wanted because it was part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their childhood.</v>

240
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>It's part of their memory and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensors,</v>

241
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the sensors do make up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't work separately,</v>

242
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but let me show you some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>

243
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are weird ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are odors and shampoo that make</v>

244
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 1>your hair feel softer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Knew?</v>

245
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of green apple you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes get in shampoos.</v>

246
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It will sensitize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch at the end of your fingers to make</v>

247
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 1>everything seem really soft and squeaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lovely.</v>

248
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.570
<v Speaker 1>There are interactions between how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things look and how they taste.</v>

249
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So if I give you two bottles of juice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and they've,</v>

250
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.410
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just water with some sugar,</v>

251
00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of sugar in it.</v>

252
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 1>One of them is lime green color died and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other is red color dyed.</v>

253
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.110
<v Speaker 1>You're convinced that the rate is sweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lime colored is sour,</v>

254
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 1>so your eyes are overruling what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue is telling you.</v>

255
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.803
<v Speaker 1>So there's this way in which the senses </v>
<v Speaker 1>are talking to each other and affecting </v>

256
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another nice example,</v>

257
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>my friend and collaborator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Spence and Oxford,</v>

258
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.360
<v Speaker 1>he gives people two bowls of yogurt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get these,</v>

259
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>these bowls of yogurt and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>yogurt in both bowls,</v>

260
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>but in one of them there's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight at the bottom of it,</v>

261
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 1>so it's heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I hand you the first bowl,</v>

262
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>try that yogurt and do the second bold </v>
<v Speaker 1>try that.</v>

263
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:27.680
<v Speaker 1>You'll get which ones creamier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

264
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody says it's the one that had</v>

265
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:31.354
<v Speaker 1>the little weight in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So touch the weight in your hand is </v>

266
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:36.154
<v Speaker 1>giving you a brain inflammation that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses to say usually something that's </v>

267
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Speaker 1>creamier and thicker is a bit heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm getting something heavier,</v>

268
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 1>it must be creamier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker.</v>

269
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.193
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way in which the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses are working to give you an </v>

270
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>estimate of what's going on around you.</v>

271
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Much of our conversation thus far has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been about how the senses can be </v>

272
00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 2>deceived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those senses,</v>

273
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.941
<v Speaker 2>I suppose operate on detecting patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistency or differences you said,</v>

274
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>and constant begin to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>negate or ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

276
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is initially quite interesting to </v>

277
00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:14.634
<v Speaker 2>me is that sensors are our never </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigational tools for what is reality </v>

278
00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:24.981
<v Speaker 2>and if our senses are to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreliable or only reliable to a point,</v>

279
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 2>then what is our relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

280
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 2>how it affect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

281
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting that we often </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how our experiences.</v>

282
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>We often don't realize that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our experience's multisensory,</v>

283
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think I'm seeing now I'm hearing </v>

284
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm touching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact as we sit here,</v>

285
00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at my face,</v>

286
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:49.784
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've maybe got the residual taste of </v>

287
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 1>tea or coffee in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

288
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the smell of this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's its own particular ordering.</v>

289
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You must know her very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

290
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and all of that information is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in separate parcels.</v>

291
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 1>No ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no out here.</v>

292
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.873
<v Speaker 1>Now I touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all unified in a single conscious </v>

293
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.423
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unified view of you and the world </v>

294
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.453
<v Speaker 1>when people have brain damage or brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury and you take out some of those </v>

296
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.150
<v Speaker 1>multisensory inputs if you remove them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things can go wrong.</v>

297
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And then what gets unified as something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems very strange to them,</v>

298
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.773
<v Speaker 1>very odd.</v>

299
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just after having had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>

300
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

301
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

302
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.963
<v Speaker 1>the say their left arm is paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not getting the right feedback </v>

303
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.463
<v Speaker 1>to know that they are ms dot paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them people who have as as </v>

304
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 1>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know sick nausea,</v>

305
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 1>think that they've still got movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>with both of their hands.</v>

306
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 1>And you say to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 1>can you lift your right hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the yes and they do.</v>

308
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Can you lift your left hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say yes,</v>

309
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 1>but the arm's not moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know it's not moving.</v>

310
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And so from the outside we think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really strange.</v>

311
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the brain is doing is saying,</v>

312
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm whatever signals I've got,</v>

313
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try and make sense of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the best way I can.</v>

314
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.373
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you see the brain's job as </v>

315
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>putting information together and trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sense of it.</v>

316
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You see it yourself when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming.</v>

317
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So you've noticed in a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really weird things happen.</v>

318
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 1>You're inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're outside,</v>

319
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you're in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in water.</v>

320
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>This is a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a woman.</v>

321
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suddenly in a different location.</v>

322
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting thing is that during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream that doesn't seem odd at all.</v>

323
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You just go with it is when you wake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that was very weird.</v>

324
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I was a bit strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're in the dream,</v>

325
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.283
<v Speaker 1>you go with all those strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>distortions and a colleague of mine </v>

326
00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:00.304
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks dreaming is the best way for </v>

327
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.950
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us to know what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be brain damaged,</v>

328
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 1>where you're getting false and or wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>signals from your senses,</v>

329
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.810
<v Speaker 1>but the brain is still trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of them.</v>

330
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:14.763
<v Speaker 1>That's why in the dream you'll put up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all sorts of weird things going on </v>

331
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 1>and in the dream it won't seem strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

332
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.480
<v Speaker 2>the sensors are the tools by which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine reality.</v>

333
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 2>There are various ways of disrupting our</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensual sensory experience.</v>

334
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

335
00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:37.660
<v Speaker 2>professor either go on a virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>helmet is a mate of mine.</v>

336
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.900
<v Speaker 2>I was on in about five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come out of that thing.</v>

337
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 2>It might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is all bullshit.</v>

338
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.120
<v Speaker 2>We really sort of affected my sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to reality.</v>

339
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Speaker 2>It made me query how valid it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

340
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>to analyze that to your example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream state on awakening.</v>

341
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I often feel this is a confection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these experimental examples that</v>

342
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:06.844
<v Speaker 2>you provided or this is a nice creamy </v>
<v Speaker 2>yogurt or was tails the apocryphal or </v>

343
00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:12.490
<v Speaker 2>otherwise that I've heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 2>if you spell rubbish or suddenly likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be more conserving here,</v>

345
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.110
<v Speaker 2>more pro the legal intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

346
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose what I'm fascinated by them </v>

347
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.293
<v Speaker 2>and what surely must drive much of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration is that to what degree is </v>

348
00:19:31.191 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Speaker 2>there an objective reality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so easily alterable and modified.</v>

349
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I think there is an objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

350
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

351
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

352
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely up for that.</v>

353
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:43.974
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

354
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

355
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that,</v>

356
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's all subjective and it's all going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in my head.</v>

358
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:50.963
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world has a habit of impressing </v>

359
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 1>itself on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

360
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't resist what it does.</v>

361
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.093
<v Speaker 1>And when you said you had the virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality helmet on and it was very </v>

362
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:01.360
<v Speaker 1>convincing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things about one is when you get the</v>

363
00:20:01.361 --> 00:20:02.194
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality helmet on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty important that you don't </v>

364
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you sit still with a helmet and you</v>

365
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:09.030
<v Speaker 1>can turn your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

366
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 1>But when people try to move around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

367
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.180
<v Speaker 1>they're getting a mismatch between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual flow in the virtual reality scene</v>

368
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>and what their body is telling them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where they are in space.</v>

369
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Even if there's not an object just with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their people then get really quite ill.</v>

370
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

371
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Disneyland,</v>

372
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.184
<v Speaker 1>in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are in this tilting a </v>

373
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:38.150
<v Speaker 1>spacecraft and they've got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming of stars coming and they're in</v>

374
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:39.684
<v Speaker 1>a star wars scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going in and out of buildings </v>

375
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and they're moving to the side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tipping upwards and backwards.</v>

376
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.933
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going terribly well until when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film gets out of sequence with the </v>

377
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:49.414
<v Speaker 1>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call that Code v because people </v>

378
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:52.594
<v Speaker 1>just start vomiting as soon as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting the body feeling that the </v>

379
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:57.664
<v Speaker 1>visuals are giving them an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows you why to be in touch with </v>

380
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.470
<v Speaker 1>reality in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

381
00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:02.304
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to work together and they've </v>

382
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 1>got to give you a lot together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix.</v>

383
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.563
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing about visual route </v>

384
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.620
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

385
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>the sense that maybe that maybe we rely </v>
<v Speaker 1>on for reality,</v>

386
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>most is touch.</v>

387
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you see something and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit doubtful about it,</v>

388
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of Macbeth looking at the dagger,</v>

389
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 1>is this a dagger I see before me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I cannot grasp it.</v>

390
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 1>He wants to touch it to see if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

391
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.430
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to take it that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's,</v>

392
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.660
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's leaking,</v>

393
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people say,</v>

394
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.013
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty sure there was a ghostly </v>

395
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they want to do is they want to put</v>

396
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>their hand in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our sense of touch,</v>

397
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.260
<v Speaker 1>even though we rely most on sight sensor</v>
<v Speaker 1>touches,</v>

398
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think gives us more confidence that we</v>

399
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 1>really are connected to an objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality out there.</v>

400
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this is underwritten by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of rational materialism.</v>

401
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thought.</v>

402
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 1>And that unpack that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little cry fest,</v>

403
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was a beautiful little dot.</v>

404
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Unpack that for me a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

405
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.393
<v Speaker 1>Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I feel is that it really beginning </v>

406
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:05.794
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst you say there is an objective </v>

407
00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:08.734
<v Speaker 1>reality and I certainly can't provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>any evidence that any reason it'd be </v>

408
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:12.154
<v Speaker 1>difficult for me to do that it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a forms that are gay that </v>

409
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.743
<v Speaker 1>are verified more quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to query that we live in </v>

410
00:22:19.931 --> 00:22:24.510
<v Speaker 1>a culture that is materialist and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means just incentive consumerism is that</v>

411
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 1>rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can be measured,</v>

412
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:27.184
<v Speaker 1>what can be rezoned to post </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment thinking governs our </v>

413
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our politics,</v>

414
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>our economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that the,</v>

415
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.650
<v Speaker 1>the US ideologically placing precedent </v>
<v Speaker 1>on I can touch it,</v>

416
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I can spend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can fuck.</v>

417
00:22:43.121 --> 00:22:48.121
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me quite animalistic and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that given that presidents,</v>

418
00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:51.820
<v Speaker 1>he's quite a political idea rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I can see this dagger in my mind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps other people will see daggers in</v>

420
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:56.880
<v Speaker 1>their mind and all the sides.</v>

421
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.640
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

422
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

423
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 1>good thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

424
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.870
<v Speaker 1>let me get back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>give us a cuddles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good look,</v>

426
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 1>because rationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're saying,</v>

427
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.223
<v Speaker 1>the kind of rational economic drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among economists who used to </v>

428
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Speaker 1>think of us as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

429
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 1>we're rational decision makers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

430
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got economic preferences and we'll</v>

431
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:16.594
<v Speaker 1>figure out what we want and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to assess what people are more </v>

432
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:19.684
<v Speaker 1>likely to buy in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what they believe and what </v>

433
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 1>they desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll just,</v>

434
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.243
<v Speaker 1>you'll just do rational decision theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible idea because we're much more </v>

435
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:28.414
<v Speaker 1>moved by our bodies and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a fight back against </v>

436
00:23:32.261 --> 00:23:33.094
<v Speaker 1>rationalism when you realize we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied creatures and if we're paying </v>

437
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just to,</v>

438
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our senses,</v>

439
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 1>bringing information from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say your heart.</v>

440
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.943
<v Speaker 1>So lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work new work by Sarah Garfinkel and </v>

441
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.124
<v Speaker 1>Hugo critchley in Sussex showing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enormously interesting </v>

442
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 1>connections between the heart and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

443
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 1>When every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time the heart beats,</v>

444
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 1>it sends a signal to the brain and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain has got a representation of all of</v>

445
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>its organs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The slow waves of the stomach,</v>

446
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

447
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.613
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's giving you an estimate of how </v>

448
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>things are with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the funny thing,</v>

449
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.523
<v Speaker 1>some people can use that signal from </v>
<v Speaker 1>their heart to estimate how they're </v>

450
00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:20.470
<v Speaker 1>doing and then that way to know their </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions better.</v>

451
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.993
<v Speaker 1>So people who are good at being in tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how the heart's rhythm is and how </v>

452
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>it's beating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel their emotions,</v>

453
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.283
<v Speaker 1>their emotions more intensely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're quicker and better able to </v>

454
00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:35.950
<v Speaker 1>detect emotions in others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we often say,</v>

455
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.470
<v Speaker 1>if people are good at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we often say,</v>

456
00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:39.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

457
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.100
<v Speaker 1>they've got good instincts or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on gut instinct.</v>

458
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.680
<v Speaker 1>So we now are beginning to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that might mean.</v>

459
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.873
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's been neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you imagine in the </v>

460
00:24:49.751 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 1>rational economic model that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to behave in the,</v>

461
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:24:54.341 --> 00:24:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the most reasonable way to get what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want given what they believe in desire.</v>

463
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You're leaving out the sense of from </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>

464
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.120
<v Speaker 1>How are they feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How anxious are they?</v>

465
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how upset,</v>

466
00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:06.454
<v Speaker 1>high relaxed I come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people who really can pay </v>

467
00:25:10.001 --> 00:25:10.834
<v Speaker 1>attention to that heart signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who are going to be </v>

468
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.193
<v Speaker 1>more in tune with them and maybe less </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken in by all the attractions and the </v>

469
00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:21.990
<v Speaker 1>distractions that materialistic world </v>
<v Speaker 1>throws at them.</v>

470
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.193
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we live in a world is </v>

471
00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:29.590
<v Speaker 1>overstimulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just with your shampoo example,</v>

472
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you touched upon how I'm</v>

473
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.473
<v Speaker 2>necessarily mark in Hasta mislead </v>
<v Speaker 2>overstimulate over demonstrate the </v>

474
00:25:40.621 --> 00:25:43.410
<v Speaker 2>capacities of certain products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consumerism,</v>

475
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:44.244
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's built upon the idea that a product </v>

476
00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:51.030
<v Speaker 2>can deliver an experience that's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rational.</v>

477
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about experience.</v>

478
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So people in marketing no longer talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about products.</v>

479
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:55.964
<v Speaker 1>They talk about experiences really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also have this new thing which </v>

480
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.123
<v Speaker 1>is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk about we must get beyond </v>

481
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>liking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about liking,</v>

482
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>it's about an emotional attachment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the product.</v>

483
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.173
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get somebody sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally engaged as people are with </v>

484
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:15.440
<v Speaker 1>their equipment in a apple Mac users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an iphone users,</v>

485
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.600
<v Speaker 1>they're really emotionally invested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

486
00:26:17.601 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a that's good.</v>

487
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>That's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that it works.</v>

488
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.213
<v Speaker 1>There's an emotional attachment to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might even look sniffily at </v>

489
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>somebody sitting beside you in a cafe if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are on a pc and not a Mac.</v>

490
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.083
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of that is being cultured and </v>

491
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 1>cultivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

492
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.173
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to be careful because while I </v>

493
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:41.530
<v Speaker 1>think there's a lot of wow materialism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about misleading people,</v>

494
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I also think it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

495
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not harmful if we think of better </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses of,</v>

496
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 1>of marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mislead,</v>

497
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:52.254
<v Speaker 1>but to lead people to experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want and they need and that they </v>

498
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be better.</v>

499
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Making People's food healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making people eat less fat,</v>

500
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:02.274
<v Speaker 1>salt and sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not making it so horrible that they </v>

501
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>making something delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable,</v>

503
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 1>getting them to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down,</v>

504
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>be mindful of the food they're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can think of ways of doing that,</v>

505
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you might give people experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were more satisfying and they'd be sated</v>

506
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>sooner and they weren't constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulated and craving,</v>

507
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:22.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me more,</v>

508
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 1>give me more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that unlikely that that will happen?</v>

509
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Because there is no imperative really </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than profit and what?</v>

510
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

511
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an imperative,</v>

512
00:27:33.571 --> 00:27:34.760
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

513
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.633
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see governments are very </v>

514
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.590
<v Speaker 1>worried about the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spending on,</v>

515
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on obesity,</v>

516
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:42.740
<v Speaker 1>they're very worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

517
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health risks to people.</v>

518
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Now government do really is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative for profit still in it.</v>

519
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.423
<v Speaker 1>You're in a different form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be because they want them to be </v>

520
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:56.180
<v Speaker 1>healthy and be able to contribute to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture being ill.</v>

521
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.103
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to contribute to the capitalist culture </v>

522
00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.300
<v Speaker 1>at well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy life and,</v>

523
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work and,</v>

524
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spent well,</v>

525
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.783
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of us want to try to slow </v>

526
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 1>down that cycle where we've made fruit </v>
<v Speaker 1>so hyper palatable.</v>

527
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so full of salt,</v>

528
00:28:12.301 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar that people just want it,</v>

529
00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:15.294
<v Speaker 1>want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it.</v>

530
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And also it's not surprising to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity numbers grow,</v>

531
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 1>especially in areas of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's just not fair because,</v>

532
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

533
00:28:25.151 --> 00:28:27.000
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're advertising to people.</v>

534
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to get them to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

535
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.570
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of companies now are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bad few,</v>

537
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people whose lives are hard,</v>

538
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.793
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of left out of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

540
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not feeling it's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

541
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:42.923
<v Speaker 1>they are being encouraged just to dose </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves with something that's </v>

542
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 1>immediately gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at supermarket,</v>

543
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Look at supermarket advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really pernicious.</v>

544
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got it really is.</v>

545
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you've got that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a taste the difference now.</v>

546
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:01.614
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about saying if you're a bit </v>

547
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:03.774
<v Speaker 1>aspirational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll offer you something a little more </v>

548
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:09.120
<v Speaker 1>expensive and you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will reward yourself by saying,</v>

549
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to taste the difference.</v>

550
00:29:10.831 --> 00:29:13.340
<v Speaker 1>I noticed this was better quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine now.</v>

551
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So the other trying to get people to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>something a little more it.</v>

552
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Which one is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

553
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.960
<v Speaker 1>which kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that just,</v>

554
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

555
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just bloody habit.</v>

556
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:28.914
<v Speaker 1>It's just habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I'm worried about because at </v>

557
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:32.334
<v Speaker 1>the bottom end of the range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that they know are not going </v>

558
00:29:34.391 --> 00:29:36.190
<v Speaker 1>to pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For our final question.</v>

559
00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:37.024
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got products that they say be </v>

560
00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:42.270
<v Speaker 1>good to yourself and I think that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainable.</v>

561
00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

562
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I bought donut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your life is.</v>

563
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.613
<v Speaker 2>Your life is pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're feeling oppressed and and hard </v>

564
00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:50.900
<v Speaker 2>pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't manage things.</v>

565
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.390
<v Speaker 2>How about right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little bit of comfort.</v>

566
00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Take that fat and salt and sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a terrible thing to do to</v>

567
00:29:57.081 --> 00:29:57.914
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working in a fascinating area </v>

568
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 2>because the perhaps thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

569
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these,</v>

570
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.613
<v Speaker 2>these are the roads between reality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one field that in reality as it is and </v>

571
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 2>that the unreliability of either of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those preconditions,</v>

572
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.230
<v Speaker 2>what is self?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is otherness?</v>

573
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:20.090
<v Speaker 2>The subjective and the objective and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two worlds a community.</v>

574
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.103
<v Speaker 2>How do you use that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does having access to this kind of </v>

575
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:29.850
<v Speaker 2>incite change your life on a daily basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we should changed it</v>

576
00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:30.981
<v Speaker 1>for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

577
00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm as vulnerable to,</v>

578
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mood changes or to,</v>

579
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.820
<v Speaker 1>to suddenly feeling hunger or to wanting</v>
<v Speaker 1>some gratification,</v>

580
00:30:37.821 --> 00:30:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

581
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.600
<v Speaker 1>when I'm thinking it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm realizing that,</v>

582
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

583
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things are going well inside of me,</v>

584
00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:48.540
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not having bad reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

585
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.503
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I feel that I'm kinda getting okay </v>

586
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 1>with the people around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

587
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:54.770
<v Speaker 1>and the things around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be in tune this.</v>

588
00:30:54.771 --> 00:30:59.120
<v Speaker 1>This is where the subject of an object </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our gear shifted to fit each other.</v>

589
00:30:59.121 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it often comes astray.</v>

590
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are sleeping badly.</v>

591
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.180
<v Speaker 1>People are eating more than they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are drinking more than they want.</v>

592
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that happening?</v>

593
00:31:10.131 --> 00:31:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's happening because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stresses and strains,</v>

594
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of being left out and you </v>

595
00:31:16.431 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 1>see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.473
<v Speaker 1>the dispossessed that cheated of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunlight just being offered really bad </v>

597
00:31:21.501 --> 00:31:22.040
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>

598
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Really kind of simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate pleasures.</v>

599
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Now can we encourage people out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get them very young.</v>

600
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:29.054
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a way in which you get </v>

601
00:31:30.501 --> 00:31:35.501
<v Speaker 1>people to be interested in not just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen or or headphones,</v>

602
00:31:36.651 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think of the other senses as well.</v>

603
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.293
<v Speaker 1>Think of the way in which you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to be interested in what they're </v>

604
00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:45.560
<v Speaker 1>eating and picking out part and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

605
00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:46.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful and,</v>

606
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.833
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a good at describing it and being </v>

607
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:50.534
<v Speaker 1>critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In France they do this little kids are </v>

608
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:53.654
<v Speaker 1>asked about the age of eight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask their parents to send them into </v>

609
00:31:57.411 --> 00:31:58.244
<v Speaker 1>school with some unusual thing to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an unusual fruit or an unusual </v>

610
00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:03.734
<v Speaker 1>cake or whatever and the other kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to try it and they're there to </v>

611
00:32:06.651 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 1>talk about it and they see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

612
00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:10.370
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit like pineapple.</v>

613
00:32:10.371 --> 00:32:11.204
<v Speaker 1>And you watch these little kids getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated because they're learning </v>

614
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.490
<v Speaker 1>about the foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're learning about themselves,</v>

615
00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:17.324
<v Speaker 1>their own reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's getting them better in tune to </v>

616
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.223
<v Speaker 1>what's good for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just what is everybody telling me I </v>

617
00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:24.200
<v Speaker 1>should well until she'd have.</v>

618
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.333
<v Speaker 2>Can you sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor that places the onus on the </v>

619
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:29.510
<v Speaker 2>individual and that is this a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

620
00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:32.910
<v Speaker 2>if you want to mark it to be a better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be a demand.</v>

621
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:36.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recycling aisle where things are a bit</v>

622
00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>more expensive when we all know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be social,</v>

623
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

624
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 1>a social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a social problem,</v>

625
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.793
<v Speaker 1>but we just think of we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>better now at thinking about social </v>

626
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.480
<v Speaker 1>factors that affect us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

627
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>so neuroscience used to be all about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual brain,</v>

628
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very individualist sort of </v>

629
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking,</v>

630
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:57.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the brain of this </v>

631
00:32:58.491 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 1>person and how are they reacting to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inputs and the stimuli,</v>

632
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>how are they likely to behave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now there's social neuroscience.</v>

633
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:06.794
<v Speaker 1>People are really interested in how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're affected when having experiences </v>

634
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:11.714
<v Speaker 1>by the presence of another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we all know if we're sitting in </v>

635
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:15.344
<v Speaker 1>front of a screen watching a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same experience as if we </v>

636
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:18.404
<v Speaker 1>were side by side with people around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were kind of sharing that and you </v>

637
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.353
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up experiments where you're </v>

638
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:29.561
<v Speaker 1>trying to see the extent to which people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are aware of one another's reactions and</v>

639
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:31.454
<v Speaker 1>judgments and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a way of tuning their own being </v>

640
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:35.174
<v Speaker 1>sort of emotionally regulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just by yourself but by how it's </v>

641
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.523
<v Speaker 1>going with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much pain I feel and how I react to </v>

642
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.034
<v Speaker 1>pain will be affected by whether there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone present in the room with me and </v>

643
00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:47.804
<v Speaker 1>also whether they're a relative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether this is someone I take care </v>

644
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take care of me.</v>

645
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.630
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

646
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of sense in which we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been very individual,</v>

647
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.284
<v Speaker 1>but we're getting better now at looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at how socially things are organized </v>

648
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.263
<v Speaker 1>because these are further suggestions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are modifications to our </v>

649
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>perception that are difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanically account for.</v>

650
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.500
<v Speaker 1>They are difficult to mechanically </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for.</v>

651
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the other thing.</v>

652
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.390
<v Speaker 1>When you're making perceptual judgments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

653
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really boring.</v>

654
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.183
<v Speaker 1>we're in a scanner and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a set of images being flashed </v>

656
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 1>up and you're asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one in the left brighter than the</v>

657
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:30.074
<v Speaker 1>one on the right or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us which one's brighter and you're </v>

658
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:33.104
<v Speaker 1>just pressing buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get people to do that </v>

659
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 1>individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

660
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.030
<v Speaker 1>they'll come out with a score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how accurate they are,</v>

661
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.360
<v Speaker 1>but we are now looking at new research </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if people make their judgments and</v>

662
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:51.470
<v Speaker 1>express their confidence rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how confident were you that that you got</v>

663
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:52.304
<v Speaker 1>that right?</v>

664
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent or 80 percent and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>people having done this individually are</v>

665
00:34:57.981 --> 00:34:58.814
<v Speaker 1>allowed to discuss with each other what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their judgments were and to share their </v>

666
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:07.841
<v Speaker 1>confidence ratings and then you ask them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come up with a collective decision.</v>

667
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.313
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that the payers are better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the strongest of the two peers </v>

668
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 1>doing it individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

669
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:19.610
<v Speaker 1>two brains are better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're making perceptual judgments,</v>

670
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.593
<v Speaker 1>if you're a light to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll arrive at a better judgement if </v>

671
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.613
<v Speaker 1>you do it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now just think of that and the </v>

672
00:35:27.531 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 1>consequences that has in general that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the decision making that we go in</v>

673
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:35.090
<v Speaker 1>for probably if we were allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss it with people,</v>

674
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's got to be discussed in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

675
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody is dominating the discussion.</v>

676
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's taking it over to brains being </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than one is a,</v>

677
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of new view because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

678
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.820
<v Speaker 1>it affects not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

679
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even our perceptions,</v>

680
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.283
<v Speaker 1>even our perceptions might be improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're light to discuss them with </v>

681
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>people of reality itself.</v>

682
00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I have a cool something that Eei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said when we spoke,</v>

683
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no self.</v>

684
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:04.584
<v Speaker 1>We exist in dialectic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is reality if you're in an hour </v>

685
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 1>minium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>captual drifting through space,</v>

686
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.034
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose is a way of physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreating the idea of a world stripped </v>

687
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:15.114
<v Speaker 1>of senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world stripped of virtuous to </v>

688
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.370
<v Speaker 1>otherness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you meditate?</v>

689
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

690
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I do other things that get me into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

691
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what I don't meditate.</v>

692
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:29.124
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember when I was a much younger </v>

693
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 1>academic and feeling all the pressures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and very stressed and you know,</v>

694
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.060
<v Speaker 1>suffering all the things that high </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress will get stress.</v>

695
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress because you're under pressure,</v>

696
00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 1>you go to publish and you've got to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on.</v>

697
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 1>At this point I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

698
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I was doing very technical philosophy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and logic and so it was.</v>

699
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.290
<v Speaker 1>And you're aware of your own science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

700
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 1>But I was glad when I started working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

701
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the connections to the sensors and </v>

702
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 1>started working in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience.</v>

703
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It's great to collaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love collaborative work.</v>

704
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

705
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 1>but before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a younger academic,</v>

706
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 1>philosophers often work in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>study on their own,</v>

707
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 1>having the hard thoughts having to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with something that's original.</v>

708
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:16.404
<v Speaker 1>That's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's clear.</v>

709
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.880
<v Speaker 1>But under those sorts of pressures I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting very,</v>

710
00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 1>very stressed and doctors would say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

711
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you should meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

712
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:24.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

713
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll try that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be coming down.</v>

714
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And then what they do is they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lying on the floor,</v>

716
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very calm,</v>

717
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and I want you to concentrate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word relax.</v>

718
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And of course I'm a philosopher of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and thinking the word relaxed.</v>

719
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not actually combined a relax.</v>

720
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm starting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind is just racing,</v>

721
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the bloody word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

722
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:49.800
<v Speaker 1>that's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to work for me.</v>

723
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 1>What I need to do is turn words off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to make sure that,</v>

724
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having a word,</v>

725
00:37:57.731 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 1>the conversations that restless internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>monologue that's going on.</v>

726
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:01.914
<v Speaker 1>So do I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me it's always been looking at </v>

727
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:07.000
<v Speaker 1>paintings and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:38:07.001 --> 00:38:07.834
<v Speaker 1>get myself along to the national gallery</v>
<v Speaker 1>or wherever was close and I would spend </v>

729
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.793
<v Speaker 1>a very long time in front of a painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the voices in my head commenting </v>

730
00:38:19.711 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noting things calm down.</v>

731
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's a moment when you stop sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of competing with what you're looking at</v>

732
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>and you stop giving your own imposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just let.</v>

733
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.243
<v Speaker 1>What's their come to you and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to really see what the artists or </v>

734
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.813
<v Speaker 1>you begin to just let a painting speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that point the word SCO and it's </v>

735
00:38:44.481 --> 00:38:45.314
<v Speaker 1>a lovely meditative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm state and I and I remain sort of </v>

736
00:38:50.011 --> 00:38:50.844
<v Speaker 1>emotionless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very peaceful in that state and it's </v>

737
00:38:53.701 --> 00:38:54.534
<v Speaker 1>very interesting that I must give off </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because people who are </v>

738
00:38:57.901 --> 00:39:00.810
<v Speaker 1>inclined to sort of walk in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the painting,</v>

739
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.033
<v Speaker 1>they sort of noticed me and they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the back as if not wanting to </v>

740
00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:10.581
<v Speaker 1>interrupt and I think that's the nearest</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get to kind of meditative state.</v>

741
00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It feels very good and the body feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>very grateful.</v>

742
00:39:17.211 --> 00:39:18.044
<v Speaker 1>I think in some way for being in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>state because everything has calmed </v>

743
00:39:20.511 --> 00:39:23.240
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level of adrenaline has dropped.</v>

744
00:39:23.241 --> 00:39:26.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not on a layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not sort of ready to react</v>

745
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:27.703
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's difficult to surrender their </v>

746
00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:30.434
<v Speaker 2>process of analysis and adjudication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as you described the process of </v>

747
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>looking at a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seem to me that you were saying that</v>

748
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 2>eventually you kind of melt into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of the creator,</v>

749
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.440
<v Speaker 2>loss of self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which my own experience of meditation is</v>

750
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.060
<v Speaker 2>somewhat about achieving sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

751
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps could be regarded as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing one's position.</v>

752
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I am here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can smell that.</v>

753
00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:01.034
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hear that if that vibrations </v>

754
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.910
<v Speaker 2>bouncing back at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means I'm in this kind of environment</v>

755
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:07.670
<v Speaker 2>and those early example you gave of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>we react to that,</v>

756
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.160
<v Speaker 2>the device that makes our footsteps </v>
<v Speaker 2>louder,</v>

757
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it means that we continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>reevaluating the parameters of self,</v>

758
00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.910
<v Speaker 2>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who we are.</v>

759
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in challenging the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between between self and </v>

760
00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:26.060
<v Speaker 2>reality because I'm curious about who </v>
<v Speaker 2>authors,</v>

761
00:40:26.061 --> 00:40:26.894
<v Speaker 2>what reality is and what our role is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked already of the way that </v>

762
00:40:30.171 --> 00:40:31.004
<v Speaker 2>different supermarket brands would mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>it at their potential customers who is </v>

763
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.210
<v Speaker 2>designated in a kind of casual net crow </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics to eat the salty,</v>

764
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.900
<v Speaker 2>fatty foods and who can eat the lash </v>
<v Speaker 2>tasteful goods.</v>

765
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming if you don't meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have not for years,</v>

766
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:49.450
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

767
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.060
<v Speaker 2>taken psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you're curious about your,</v>

768
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your knowledge of neuroscience,</v>

769
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.600
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Oh,</v>

770
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.190
<v Speaker 2>mind altering substances and what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what can be a.</v>

771
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So I think they are interesting and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the,</v>

772
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of interest in them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of psychiatry,</v>

773
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:15.000
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience at the moment now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that.</v>

774
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

775
00:41:16.111 --> 00:41:17.010
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

776
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I can remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

777
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're hideously drunk and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

778
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.153
<v Speaker 1>really off your face and your eyes look </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way and then when you move them you </v>

779
00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:29.354
<v Speaker 1>feel the image didn't quite come with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you at the right time and things are </v>

780
00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:32.714
<v Speaker 1>sort of shuddering and you see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is breaking down the way </v>

781
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 1>the sentence is normally cooperate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

782
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.223
<v Speaker 1>And at that point you probably start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a dissolving of the boundaries of </v>

783
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 1>the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

784
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a good way.</v>

785
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 1>A good way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

786
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.063
<v Speaker 1>I think that is interesting to see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self is not as some philosophers </v>

787
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 1>thought indissolvable single constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>present thing that was there.</v>

788
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Which philosophers think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean Rene Descartes,</v>

789
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.363
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that self was a kind of enduring </v>

790
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 1>continuing presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

791
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.033
<v Speaker 1>that was you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take all the bits of the body </v>

792
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 1>away and there would still be there </v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

793
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 1>which was the thinking thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

794
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.253
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way in which our sense of </v>

795
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:19.754
<v Speaker 1>self is composed of so many components </v>
<v Speaker 1>and parts that all have to be working </v>

796
00:42:24.801 --> 00:42:25.634
<v Speaker 1>seamlessly together like an orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they're unified you get </v>

797
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 1>that probably illusion that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

798
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.890
<v Speaker 1>is in a single unified space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

799
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and actually I think you look at people </v>
<v Speaker 1>either with psychedelic drugs or again,</v>

800
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.183
<v Speaker 1>under extreme conditions of drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you look at people with brain damage </v>

801
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.053
<v Speaker 1>and you see the way in which some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are breaking down and that </v>

802
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:55.661
<v Speaker 1>tells you that it's not so obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of self is in a permanent and</v>

803
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 1>reliably always going to be there.</v>

804
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It's fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be disintegrated.</v>

805
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:04.094
<v Speaker 1>It could kind of fracture and fragment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see people with brain </v>

806
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

807
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:11.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.823
<v Speaker 1>people who disowned a limb or people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>neglect everything on the lefthand side </v>

809
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 1>of their visual field or people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that they're dead.</v>

810
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Or people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think that their relatives have been</v>

811
00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:24.704
<v Speaker 1>replaced with aliens or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those cases are often used in a very </v>

812
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 1>annoying way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a kind of a freak show circus where</v>

813
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:33.831
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

814
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

815
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 1>here's a man who mistook his wife for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hat.</v>

816
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.693
<v Speaker 1>All of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what we should say instead </v>

817
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.113
<v Speaker 1>when we look at people with these funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions is why aren't the rest of us </v>

818
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.800
<v Speaker 1>not more like them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that we don't have these weird</v>

819
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and funny experiences and it's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

820
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

821
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but for the grace of God go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

822
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.333
<v Speaker 1>if anything did breakdown of some of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems fail to deliver what they </v>

823
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:00.980
<v Speaker 1>usually do and what we don't notice they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

824
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You would get a fragmentation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self and we would end up in the way that</v>

825
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.423
<v Speaker 1>a lot of patients describe her in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that people who've been on lots of </v>

826
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.730
<v Speaker 1>our to Jen's describe so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

827
00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:13.564
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be more sympathetic and more </v>

828
00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

829
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.523
<v Speaker 1>of other people not like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we realized how much it takes to </v>

830
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 1>sustain this illusion that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unified and self-like and present.</v>

831
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a non anomalous experiences </v>

832
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't warrant</v>

833
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 2>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could be behaving in a way that is</v>

834
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 2>collectively hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Without it ever causing a glitch on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>graph because it's because of.</v>

836
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Because of our understanding of norms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you got any interest in the sort of</v>

837
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.713
<v Speaker 2>changing morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing norms tastes the role of taste </v>

838
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:57.470
<v Speaker 2>as in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is good taste,</v>

839
00:44:57.471 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 2>this is bad taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is elegant,</v>

840
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.473
<v Speaker 2>elegant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

841
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think.</v>

842
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>norms,</v>

843
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:06.054
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting because that which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>most familiar we think is a permanent </v>

844
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and has to be like that and it's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>under conditions of brain damage or or,</v>

845
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.210
<v Speaker 1>or an extreme or unusual anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

846
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 1>We suddenly realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

847
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't always have to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things could change radically.</v>

848
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.990
<v Speaker 1>So I think the familiar is taken for </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted.</v>

849
00:45:28.991 --> 00:45:31.700
<v Speaker 1>The familiar is taken as bedrock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll always be like that.</v>

850
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.593
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just what it is to be human and </v>

851
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 1>then we realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.170
<v Speaker 1>slightly late and to our shame it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

853
00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I think in terms of morals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the something like the same issue here,</v>

854
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.813
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of interest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in clinical neuroscience on people </v>

855
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:52.881
<v Speaker 1>who've had brain damage leading to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving in some morally a porn way.</v>

856
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.200
<v Speaker 1>What like p two failures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a famous case,</v>

857
00:45:58.201 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>you probably heard about the case in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia where there's a man who,</v>

858
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.083
<v Speaker 1>who suddenly starts behaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate to his daughter and his </v>

859
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:09.234
<v Speaker 1>wife report some and he gets sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>banged away and he's going to be given </v>

860
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:17.160
<v Speaker 1>some remedial training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got these ptfe like thoughts,</v>

861
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's also complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>headaches now.</v>

862
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:19.734
<v Speaker 1>They take them in to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eventually scanned him and find </v>

863
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 1>that he's got a huge tumor in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

864
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 1>orbital frontal cortex here and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating,</v>

865
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the resect it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they take most of it out.</v>

866
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And then the pedophilic tendencies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone away.</v>

867
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Now the tumor hadn't completely gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

868
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It regrew and the pedophile tendencies </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and again,</v>

869
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:44.784
<v Speaker 1>he had to be incarcerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what's really interesting about him </v>

870
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 1>is that he knew it was bad to do this.</v>

871
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 1>He tried to hide what he was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

872
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.600
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

873
00:46:56.601 --> 00:46:59.390
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stop himself doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of people,</v>

874
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.750
<v Speaker 1>lawyers get very worried about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases because they say,</v>

875
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.210
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest be a defense in court saying,</v>

876
00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neurons made me do it.</v>

877
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't me golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually actually that's,</v>

878
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.310
<v Speaker 1>that's they don't realize that's worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if somebody says I couldn't help</v>

879
00:47:16.311 --> 00:47:17.144
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to incarcerate </v>

880
00:47:18.621 --> 00:47:21.410
<v Speaker 1>them and keep them locked up for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety of everybody around.</v>

881
00:47:21.411 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not as though they're going to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of court free.</v>

882
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:24.523
<v Speaker 1>If they say I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't help myself that they're </v>

883
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.690
<v Speaker 1>going to be in a restrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's interesting about his cases,</v>

884
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:35.850
<v Speaker 1>he knew it was wrong and then said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had no way of controlling it.</v>

885
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we often tend to think of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaving in some morally apparent way.</v>

886
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong.</v>

887
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why they do it because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the difference.</v>

888
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's somebody who knows it's wrong</v>

889
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and can't stop himself doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we realize a bit more like addiction.</v>

890
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 1>There's something here which we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate out.</v>

891
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.123
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough just to have good </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions to know what's right or </v>

892
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:01.024
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to have the means to </v>

893
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 1>be able to follow it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry it out,</v>

894
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.600
<v Speaker 1>resist something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not do that,</v>

895
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and we're relearning that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

896
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.453
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an orchestration of lots of little </v>

897
00:48:11.591 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 1>systems and if something goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in control of it.</v>

898
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.153
<v Speaker 1>You're inside of your reach is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting ethical question because I </v>

899
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:24.410
<v Speaker 1>suppose it's to do with determinism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal foreign aid if,</v>

900
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.493
<v Speaker 1>if at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I suppose perhaps in centuries </v>

901
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 1>to come that will be seen merely as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious example,</v>

902
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:33.064
<v Speaker 1>an outlier of the ways that all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal autonomy is being and the </v>

903
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.213
<v Speaker 1>written or fueled by sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological events that could be seen </v>

904
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:44.380
<v Speaker 1>as a meet urology.</v>

905
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Just the weather of our consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

906
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it is the weather of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

907
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

908
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:50.663
<v Speaker 1>we fluctuate and we're fickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising therefore that </v>

909
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:54.420
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

910
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.330
<v Speaker 1>are often compared to the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.760
<v Speaker 1>because blue or stormy or sunny </v>
<v Speaker 1>disposition.</v>

912
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also we're not very good.</v>

913
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Even though we've now got all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites and we're trying to predict,</v>

914
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 1>we're not very good at predicting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather.</v>

915
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.063
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather forecasts that the first thing </v>

916
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 1>someone who tells you is what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

917
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

918
00:49:13.621 --> 00:49:15.140
<v Speaker 1>there's was a high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

919
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:16.623
<v Speaker 1>it was very high pressure and the winds </v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming in from the south and then </v>

920
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that led to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

921
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

922
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is build up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your confidence that once it's happened,</v>

923
00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.283
<v Speaker 1>they know why they can explain it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hoping that that will let you </v>

924
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.153
<v Speaker 1>believe that they can now predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things still happen in the weather </v>

925
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:34.090
<v Speaker 1>that were not predicted.</v>

926
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And we suddenly had a rush of snow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK and boy,</v>

927
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.950
<v Speaker 1>nobody was expecting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

928
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear the weather warnings about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

929
00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So I think people are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once somebody has,</v>

930
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has acted.</v>

931
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.624
<v Speaker 1>Once they'd done something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably try and figure out why </v>

932
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:51.004
<v Speaker 1>they did it and an attribute motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we can't do is really predict </v>

933
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 1>what people will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

934
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just really not good at that.</v>

935
00:49:57.001 --> 00:49:58.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why people are like the way there</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

936
00:49:58.651 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 1>We're really not able to see in advance </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they'll do.</v>

937
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.250
<v Speaker 1>They'll have tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be things that you,</v>

938
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you kind of expect them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

939
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:08.703
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that people can always </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave out of character and you can </v>

940
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:19.480
<v Speaker 1>still make sense of it is challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

941
00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 1>The systems of taxonomy that we put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that are,</v>

942
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 1>these group of people are likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>commit crimes.</v>

943
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.493
<v Speaker 1>These group of people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people or be elevated and </v>

944
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:30.443
<v Speaker 1>respected because there's too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity for these systems to be </v>

945
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:34.964
<v Speaker 1>reliable and these categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually constructed with a particular </v>

946
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.500
<v Speaker 1>narrative in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are an just that phrase,</v>

947
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

948
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:44.563
<v Speaker 1>how dangerous does that sound when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're going to castigate a </v>

949
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:49.874
<v Speaker 1>whole group of people as though you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what they're like and </v>

950
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 1>how they're going to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the terrifying thing.</v>

951
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 1>The more that we get information from </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience in courts,</v>

952
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.663
<v Speaker 1>we see pictures of brains with areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are lighting up and of course we </v>

953
00:51:06.111 --> 00:51:07.790
<v Speaker 1>know areas don't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll light up.</v>

954
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.730
<v Speaker 1>This is just sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

955
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also how we create the pictures</v>

956
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.450
<v Speaker 1>that demonstrate where we think travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>through language,</v>

957
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 1>but the power of image and a court is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong.</v>

958
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:21.083
<v Speaker 1>A lot of studies going on recently with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura's neuroscientist showing that </v>

959
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>courts are incredibly moved by somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashing up,</v>

960
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:29.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an image inside a skull and here's a </v>

961
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.004
<v Speaker 1>little patch of activity where it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be going orange and that's obviously </v>

962
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:35.830
<v Speaker 1>why somebody behaves like that's his </v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

963
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:40.930
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course what the public don't know</v>

964
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 1>is that that image is not a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

965
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 1>It's none of a single brain never is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing scanning,</v>

966
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you get say 30 subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your scan them all performing a task and</v>

967
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:57.914
<v Speaker 1>you scan them all when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing some contrast task and what </v>

968
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:06.581
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at is a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the average brain that</v>

969
00:52:08.451 --> 00:52:13.130
<v Speaker 1>shows the average activity difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between performing one task and another.</v>

970
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's not an individual that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a statistical generalization.</v>

971
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So while you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for any 30 people,</v>

972
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>26 of them are definitely in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>

973
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:26.054
<v Speaker 1>going to behave this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be the one person who who </v>

974
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:30.944
<v Speaker 1>want and who doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when it comes to making </v>

975
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 1>decisions about people's individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

976
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not wanting to go buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>well statistically.</v>

977
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 1>People like this have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.653
<v Speaker 1>re-offended or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a study that was done in a New </v>

979
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Mexico I think where they scanned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains of a longterm inmates and then </v>

980
00:52:57.081 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Speaker 1>had follow ups of when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>

981
00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:01.004
<v Speaker 1>if they were paroled and whether the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rear fender and it turned out that </v>

982
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.920
<v Speaker 1>getting people to perform go nogo tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're,</v>

983
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:10.754
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're excited and ready to press a </v>

984
00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:12.854
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they might go to hourly and they </v>

985
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:14.181
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

986
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:15.014
<v Speaker 1>make an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who had no impulse control or </v>

987
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 1>very little impulse control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

988
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:20.283
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they very little activation in the </v>

989
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:24.590
<v Speaker 1>anterior singular singular cortex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

990
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.063
<v Speaker 1>they reoffended more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more reliably than people who had </v>

991
00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.720
<v Speaker 1>greater activation and more impulse </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

992
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Not turned out that when the study was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done over I think a 10 year period,</v>

993
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:40.903
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuro imaging scans gave something </v>

994
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:49.641
<v Speaker 1>like 66 percent reliable judgment about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether someone was lightly to refund.</v>

995
00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:52.423
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the parole board who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding it only had a success rate of </v>

996
00:53:55.011 --> 00:53:59.210
<v Speaker 1>25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what do we do about that?</v>

997
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You kinda think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

998
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd want to get better than 25 percent</v>

999
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:05.744
<v Speaker 1>of your guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we let this person out now or </v>

1000
00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:10.070
<v Speaker 1>early or should we let them complete the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence?</v>

1001
00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:13.610
<v Speaker 1>You want to do better than I'm 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent right?</v>

1002
00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:17.380
<v Speaker 1>That they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll dreadfully low.</v>

1003
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.600
<v Speaker 1>So 66 is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>

1004
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.273
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the scanning data is averaging </v>

1005
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1006
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:27.421
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:54:27.421 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 1>in general people with low activation </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the ACC,</v>

1008
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average most of them will re offend,</v>

1009
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 1>but if you're the one who's not part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that data,</v>

1010
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.593
<v Speaker 1>a summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to stop that guy from </v>

1011
00:54:44.241 --> 00:54:46.580
<v Speaker 1>being paroled?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you say,</v>

1012
00:54:46.581 --> 00:54:48.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average people do so that,</v>

1013
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:49.584
<v Speaker 1>that raises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for society that raises huge </v>

1014
00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:52.340
<v Speaker 1>moral problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1015
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.203
<v Speaker 1>this new knowledge is not neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make some really tough </v>

1016
00:54:56.571 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>decisions about how we use it</v>

1017
00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.400
<v Speaker 2>know so little is because of often where</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding comes from.</v>

1018
00:55:03.401 --> 00:55:04.234
<v Speaker 2>There's a usually a bias in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The incentives and objectives of </v>

1019
00:55:08.741 --> 00:55:13.741
<v Speaker 2>particular institutions usually vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests involved.</v>

1020
00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:18.670
<v Speaker 2>A particular picture of reality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually presented and preserved.</v>

1021
00:55:18.671 --> 00:55:21.280
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I've learned over my </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>

1022
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:22.323
<v Speaker 2>I was personally incentivized to </v>
<v Speaker 2>undertake a process of conducting these </v>

1023
00:55:24.911 --> 00:55:28.720
<v Speaker 2>interviews because I do a degree in </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

1024
00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:33.100
<v Speaker 2>in global politics so vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over the course of these interviews,</v>

1025
00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:38.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I've discovered and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of crystallizing in my mind,</v>

1026
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:38.914
<v Speaker 2>is the invisible caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless it affects the interest of the </v>

1027
00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:44.044
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must do something about climate </v>

1028
00:55:45.401 --> 00:55:48.700
<v Speaker 2>change unless it affects the interests </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the powerful.</v>

1029
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Every single conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ongoing conversation,</v>

1030
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.313
<v Speaker 2>it has this obscured never discussed </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of information that we are driven </v>

1031
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:59.223
<v Speaker 2>to conserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are driven to keep institutions </v>

1032
00:56:02.741 --> 00:56:04.750
<v Speaker 2>invested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests protected.</v>

1033
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.793
<v Speaker 2>Very seldom that they are challenged and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways I've noted that that </v>

1034
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:12.160
<v Speaker 2>happens is placing a great deal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>owners on individual choice,</v>

1035
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people have done that and that you</v>

1036
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.643
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that rather than acknowledging the </v>

1037
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:22.800
<v Speaker 2>role of states or transnational </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations in influencing people's.</v>

1038
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:24.783
<v Speaker 2>So the work that you do where in in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity and understanding the </v>

1039
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:30.334
<v Speaker 2>mechanics of the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Invokana as an individual and an </v>

1040
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:35.640
<v Speaker 2>inverted commas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1041
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.633
<v Speaker 2>reality seems quite vital because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so many modifications that are </v>

1042
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 2>altering what reality</v>

1043
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.570
<v Speaker 1>is or our perception of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not altering relative,</v>

1044
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but they're altering our view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

1045
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:52.500
<v Speaker 1>We look at climate change as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crucial one.</v>

1046
00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:56.730
<v Speaker 1>The problem with climate change is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the science.</v>

1047
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 1>The sciences in the science has done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is people.</v>

1048
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.410
<v Speaker 1>There are companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

1049
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.273
<v Speaker 1>who do not want government into </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupting their business and telling </v>

1050
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:06.724
<v Speaker 1>them they have to reduce emissions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them they'll have to do </v>

1051
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1052
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.430
<v Speaker 1>that threatens their profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's our problem.</v>

1053
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.230
<v Speaker 1>How do we do with the people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue.</v>

1054
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.153
<v Speaker 1>It's not one more paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more piece of evidence is actually </v>

1055
00:57:19.851 --> 00:57:20.684
<v Speaker 1>going to convince anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how do you deal with those sort of </v>

1056
00:57:23.091 --> 00:57:25.560
<v Speaker 1>political agents of change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you hide?</v>

1057
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You Hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you monopolize that.</v>

1058
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:29.270
<v Speaker 1>How do you get people on site to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1059
00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:32.520
<v Speaker 1>That wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder that too,</v>

1060
00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1061
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be with rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>information because as you said,</v>

1062
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 2>the affirmation is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1063
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.600
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it would need to be where </v>
<v Speaker 2>power is,</v>

1064
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:41.463
<v Speaker 2>needs to alter as long as power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability to influence remains with </v>

1065
00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:48.683
<v Speaker 2>people that are in profit rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>large number of people as long as power </v>

1066
00:57:52.261 --> 00:57:53.160
<v Speaker 2>is not disseminating.</v>

1067
00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So that will be careful with the talk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1068
00:57:56.061 --> 00:57:56.894
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people will often just sort of </v>

1069
00:57:58.101 --> 00:57:59.030
<v Speaker 1>reached for the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1070
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Tony Benn always saying,</v>

1071
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people have power,</v>

1072
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.790
<v Speaker 1>where did they get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gave it to them?</v>

1073
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.430
<v Speaker 1>How do they use it often and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how they use it.</v>

1074
00:58:10.431 --> 00:58:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1075
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:11.903
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you begin to see we've got to </v>

1076
00:58:12.831 --> 00:58:13.664
<v Speaker 1>look at those stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to look at power wasn't just </v>

1077
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:16.903
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly it was there and it was </v>

1078
00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:21.170
<v Speaker 1>exercised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had to be people who were,</v>

1079
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agents of,</v>

1080
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring it and others who gave,</v>

1081
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:28.550
<v Speaker 1>gave in and seeded and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have this power and I'm,</v>

1082
00:58:28.551 --> 00:58:29.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to grant it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where those individual </v>

1083
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:32.224
<v Speaker 1>decisions and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those judgments and those influences </v>

1084
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:36.460
<v Speaker 1>come in and they need to be looked at</v>

1085
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.840
<v Speaker 2>really carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What fascinates me is that how much work</v>

1086
00:58:39.841 --> 00:58:43.110
<v Speaker 2>goes into concealing power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now sort of live in a time where it's</v>

1087
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:43.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1088
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.800
<v Speaker 2>where is this power now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1089
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.793
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if democracy at the level of the state </v>

1090
00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:54.900
<v Speaker 2>seems to be retained within quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited borders.</v>

1091
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:55.853
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to access transnational </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations that they know that we </v>

1092
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.373
<v Speaker 2>purport to live by rationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a rational decision on discovering </v>

1093
00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:05.994
<v Speaker 2>that climate change is real and can only</v>
<v Speaker 2>be effected if agriculture altars in </v>

1094
00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:15.981
<v Speaker 2>this way and if energy and power </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies or in this way.</v>

1095
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.690
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is the resistance?</v>

1096
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you could determine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1097
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.093
<v Speaker 2>he's here</v>

1098
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.610
<v Speaker 1>until you have purchase in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevance.</v>

1099
00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.453
<v Speaker 1>No point in telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your bottles in this Bin and that </v>

1100
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:28.934
<v Speaker 1>bin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's never a good telling people </v>

1101
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:33.940
<v Speaker 1>what to what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They often don't mean think a thing of,</v>

1102
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I know more about his food and health </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

1103
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 1>people telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling others what to eat,</v>

1104
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.450
<v Speaker 1>what not to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's good for you,</v>

1105
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.284
<v Speaker 1>what's bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to keep away from these particular </v>

1106
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>types of food and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never works.</v>

1107
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So what you've got to do is incentivize </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in some other way.</v>

1108
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And with food it's always deliciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deliciousness will win out.</v>

1109
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.143
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether you tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you know this is the healthy </v>

1110
00:59:57.741 --> 00:59:58.574
<v Speaker 1>option and that's the unhealthy option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat what they prefer and what </v>

1111
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>they find delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

1112
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:07.370
<v Speaker 1>as you're trying to get messages across </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you can find delicious food,</v>

1113
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.593
<v Speaker 1>if it's Vegan or vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people becoming Vegan </v>

1114
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people resisting it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

1115
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food won't be so delicious.</v>

1116
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>So then we've got to make delicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan food.</v>

1117
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to actually convert </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say,</v>

1118
01:00:19.251 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give up lots of,</v>

1119
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:22.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1120
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads of cattle,</v>

1121
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:26.024
<v Speaker 1>which are very expensive to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can make something so delicious </v>

1122
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:29.504
<v Speaker 1>that you don't mind doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing rather than the moral </v>

1123
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are very principled,</v>

1124
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>some people are very moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do it,</v>

1125
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but we'll move them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

1126
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.363
<v Speaker 1>as you try to get people to eat better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to get people to have better </v>

1127
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:40.994
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're up against multinational </v>

1128
01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:48.521
<v Speaker 1>companies who are fantastically good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've got lots of research arms.</v>

1129
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>They are to find out how to grab people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at mark,</v>

1130
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1131
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>just jacket norris extra cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shanker's book,</v>

1132
01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:58.663
<v Speaker 1>the Dorito effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic when you see just how </v>

1133
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:01.904
<v Speaker 1>much work goes into making a Dorito so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more delicious and desirable than </v>

1134
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>any other food from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the luke of the bag,</v>

1135
01:01:08.151 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>from the feel of the bag from the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open it from the order that comes up</v>

1136
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>from the slight spiciness on your tongue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>

1137
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Multinational companies are doing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you to engage with that product,</v>

1138
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>so it's going to be a very hard fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way you're gonna be able to sort</v>

1139
01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>of wean people off things that are easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper,</v>

1140
01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.173
<v Speaker 1>a desirable and delicious to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's healthy is not telling them it's </v>

1141
01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to make better stuff.</v>

1142
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make things that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually move them at the gut level,</v>

1143
01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.013
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the smell and taste and the look and </v>

1144
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even beyond that gut level.</v>

1145
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:41.414
<v Speaker 1>Because if as soon as system in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I may say that the suggestion that </v>

1146
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>people will only act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in this example on the basis of</v>

1147
01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:51.014
<v Speaker 1>self interest of deliciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience of deliciousness is </v>

1148
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:55.664
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a moral equivalent to the delicious </v>

1149
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>as sense of beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of connection,</v>

1150
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.413
<v Speaker 1>of gut shot and fraternity for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder how we access the access </v>

1151
01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:07.274
<v Speaker 1>that you've got to have time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>patience and a certain amount of </v>

1152
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:10.394
<v Speaker 1>leisure.</v>

1153
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:11.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean the people who pay a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to but you have got rather </v>

1154
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>comfortable lives and an ability to sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of take time out and stop and be mindful</v>

1155
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and thoughtful about what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with and we,</v>

1156
01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>we didn't pick up on a point that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised but we can come back to that just</v>

1157
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.074
<v Speaker 1>briefly on matters of taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it used to be that the way that you </v>

1158
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>influence society was the idea of seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very bad taste to,</v>

1159
01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch this television show or it's </v>

1160
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>very bad taste to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat this thing or is there any,</v>

1161
01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very naf to have pineapples stakes </v>

1162
01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:42.144
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1163
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gammon stakes with a pineapple </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring on it.</v>

1164
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>The Cherry on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very knife let's,</v>

1165
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>let's aspire to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1166
01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but that was often those ideas of tastes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what people wanted to identify with.</v>

1167
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:59.300
<v Speaker 1>We're often in a dictated by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

1168
01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>a kind of elite position who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening others into saying,</v>

1169
01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:04.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know you're,</v>

1170
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not really making it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think what we eat,</v>

1171
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>what we do with our leisure time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>

1172
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we drink,</v>

1173
01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:15.663
<v Speaker 1>how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we spend any spare money that's all </v>

1174
01:03:20.321 --> 01:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>about who we want to identify with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1175
01:03:23.351 --> 01:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It is a kind of identity thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some very nice entity and otherness,</v>

1176
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:29.163
<v Speaker 1>identity and otherness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louise excluded in this group who's not </v>

1177
01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>choosing what I do,</v>

1178
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>who's making an apple.</v>

1179
01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1180
01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>one of us prawn cocktail really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
01:03:37.811 --> 01:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of wanting to identify.</v>

1182
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.693
<v Speaker 1>It's very powerful and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does come through food and </v>

1183
01:03:44.531 --> 01:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>clothing and music and all the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1184
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:47.723
<v Speaker 1>And politically there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an angle here because once </v>

1185
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:51.504
<v Speaker 1>you've decided who you identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when decisions come along that you </v>

1186
01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>haven't thought through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier to say,</v>

1187
01:03:58.291 --> 01:03:58.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did it?</v>

1188
01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the group identify with?</v>

1189
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Tend to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1190
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:02.844
<v Speaker 1>I'll go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing more and more of that </v>

1191
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:05.814
<v Speaker 1>in social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I the fact that having already </v>

1192
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:11.520
<v Speaker 1>decided who you belong to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's an issue and you haven't made</v>

1193
01:04:11.521 --> 01:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>up your mind if your group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your people decide one way,</v>

1194
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to tag yourself on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of that,</v>

1195
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are starting to get islands or people</v>

1196
01:04:21.731 --> 01:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>separated from each other because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to the people who are.</v>

1197
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.953
<v Speaker 1>You're identifying with a not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily engaging with and listening </v>

1198
01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:29.314
<v Speaker 1>to the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course will make better </v>

1199
01:04:30.401 --> 01:04:31.234
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's uncomfortable if we have </v>

1200
01:04:33.221 --> 01:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>more diversity of opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got more.</v>

1201
01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>People are kind of challenging.</v>

1202
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we don't have geo </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes.</v>

1203
01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:44.901
<v Speaker 2>Now we have an atomized online opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups to return to a point about beauty</v>

1204
01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:47.334
<v Speaker 2>there for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think of it from an artistic </v>

1205
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically the keats quote,</v>

1206
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>beauty is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth is beauty.</v>

1207
01:04:55.051 --> 01:05:00.051
<v Speaker 2>That beauty is value is only in that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is an Avatar of goodness rightness.</v>

1208
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.300
<v Speaker 2>So I don't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of other,</v>

1209
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.233
<v Speaker 2>of course I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in terms of aesthetics and perhaps </v>

1210
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:08.484
<v Speaker 2>Oscar Wilde is a good vehicle for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think of sort of like wild </v>

1211
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>initially superficial seeming sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aesthetics?</v>

1212
01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:15.903
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on examination it seems that Wilde was </v>

1213
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>particularly interested in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purity,</v>

1214
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.290
<v Speaker 2>innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1215
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>so some charming ideas around </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism in these,</v>

1216
01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 2>right in about children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1217
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1218
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:33.363
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about the senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that there are ways of dialing </v>

1219
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.430
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialing down in the bowl of yogurt,</v>

1220
01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optical illusions that we,</v>

1221
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>even when you see them in a tabloid </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper sort of dazzle you.</v>

1222
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.043
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were these things that seemed </v>

1223
01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>three d when you're standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a dinosaur was coming out.</v>

1224
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.693
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always fascinated by that because </v>

1225
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:50.463
<v Speaker 2>there's something of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what Freud would call the </v>

1226
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:52.534
<v Speaker 2>uncanny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There've been moments I've had with </v>

1227
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics when I think reality is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think it is.</v>

1228
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.320
<v Speaker 2>And this is just but one bandwidth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk for a moment of,</v>

1229
01:06:01.321 --> 01:06:01.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1230
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:02.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1231
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.873
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live within a limited spectrum of </v>

1232
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:05.974
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live within a limited range of sound </v>

1233
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 2>vibration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a,</v>

1234
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>is it pointless to speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we.</v>

1235
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.003
<v Speaker 2>There are realms of senses for which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>do not have the instruments that we're </v>

1236
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:20.973
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by waves and all or his </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights and fields for things for which </v>

1237
01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 2>we don't even have the language because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the instruments to receive</v>

1238
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1239
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could think that,</v>

1240
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1241
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more intrigued by the idea that,</v>

1242
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:36.103
<v Speaker 1>that we're already in receipt of so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory inputs that we don't pay </v>

1243
01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>attention to it we don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're influenced by them.</v>

1244
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.353
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we are not aware of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're not shaping our </v>

1245
01:06:47.911 --> 01:06:50.220
<v Speaker 1>experience conditioning what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1246
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but here's another thing that to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beauty,</v>

1247
01:06:52.981 --> 01:06:56.460
<v Speaker 1>which I think links with the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that might interest you.</v>

1248
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 1>We all operate a kind of everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics.</v>

1249
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 1>We choose which Mug to have in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

1250
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>When we're having our breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like things arranged a certain way.</v>

1251
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:14.850
<v Speaker 1>We will make little efforts to make our </v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings feel more pleasing,</v>

1252
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>happier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1253
01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:18.643
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible sign of the poverty of the </v>

1254
01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>spirit when people are really crushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they no longer even do that.</v>

1255
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:25.643
<v Speaker 1>So there was a sociologist in Glasgow in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies who went and lived in the </v>

1256
01:07:30.771 --> 01:07:31.604
<v Speaker 1>Gorbals uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had to kind of manufacture an </v>

1257
01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>accent so people didn't treat her as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsider.</v>

1258
01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to do anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
01:07:38.331 --> 01:07:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll be among the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1260
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to</v>

1261
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1262
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:46.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was able to sort of see roughly </v>

1263
01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like an anthropologist,</v>

1264
01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go and brilliant and she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she said it always struck me.</v>

1265
01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:54.944
<v Speaker 1>She said the people I was living amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were most deprived didn't even make </v>

1266
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 1>any effort to make their immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings prettier or pleasant.</v>

1267
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:05.483
<v Speaker 1>Other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it put a painter Cota and on the door </v>

1268
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>they'd have a plant part outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

1269
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.633
<v Speaker 1>There are ways in which they just wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make their environment a little </v>

1270
01:08:13.471 --> 01:08:14.304
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you saw people who couldn't </v>

1271
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>even do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so broken.</v>

1272
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:18.464
<v Speaker 1>They were so crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so beaten down that even that </v>

1273
01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.064
<v Speaker 1>attempt just to make your immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings feel more pleasing had </v>

1274
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:25.904
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that urge to have a little </v>

1275
01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>bit of everyday aesthetics to make our </v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings nicer,</v>

1276
01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>to make a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a choice about what,</v>

1277
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.060
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what spoon.</v>

1278
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>We'll use what Mug we'll use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>

1279
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>how will we just want things to look on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

1280
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.043
<v Speaker 1>That's very basic about being okay about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing and about humanity and when </v>

1281
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:48.970
<v Speaker 1>that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really in trouble in a few things.</v>

1282
01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:49.913
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to pick up like a technique for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in addiction for measuring your </v>

1283
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 1>wellness and sort of a personal wellness</v>
<v Speaker 1>index where you can sort of ask yourself</v>

1284
01:08:58.161 --> 01:08:58.994
<v Speaker 1>a series of questions and give yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>a one to 10 evaluation on how clean is </v>

1285
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:06.440
<v Speaker 1>your car at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well is your diet?</v>

1286
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.360
<v Speaker 1>How often are you arguing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse?</v>

1287
01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:10.550
<v Speaker 1>These sort of tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think myself,</v>

1288
01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:14.860
<v Speaker 1>there've been times in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would almost eat the cereal out of box.</v>

1289
01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Typically tippecanoe chew now into Udl </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've got.</v>

1290
01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I've got no demonstration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessness,</v>

1291
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.220
<v Speaker 1>no idea of the beauty of the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.100
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the beauty of the world.</v>

1293
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1294
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:26.743
<v Speaker 1>those values have totally broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I'm Grayson Perry and he's </v>

1295
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:34.700
<v Speaker 1>brilliant documentaries about taste and </v>
<v Speaker 1>class where he sort of,</v>

1296
01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1297
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.313
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose he's thesis was that like are </v>

1298
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.753
<v Speaker 1>the higher up the class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less demonstrative class structure </v>

1299
01:09:44.121 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that less demonstrative taste was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class culture,</v>

1300
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 1>big Larry vehicles with staff on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry,</v>

1301
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.143
<v Speaker 1>tatters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get into the upper </v>

1302
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:55.424
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper class is sort of everything </v>

1303
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>understated no labels in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

1304
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a wonderful way of tracking class</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1305
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>how classes exemplified and further on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasty sort of showed like there's a clip</v>

1306
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:12.730
<v Speaker 1>of warm metal work in men's club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of at the front with some kind of a</v>

1307
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.673
<v Speaker 1>crooner guy and she was all drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a wonderful emotional experience </v>

1308
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>and crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said like,</v>

1309
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>but why do we think of that as somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of vulgar?</v>

1310
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a woman generally weeping in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>box at lover him,</v>

1311
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 1>we think of the height of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication,</v>

1312
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 1>who is deciding what is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is deciding what is good tastes.</v>

1313
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Very often it's about distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1314
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.880
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people when they consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high arts at the fine arts,</v>

1315
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:38.321
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1316
01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to embrace it,</v>

1317
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but they want a kind of distance from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1318
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:45.170
<v Speaker 1>So I think our prayers like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so staged.</v>

1319
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's so artificial that you know you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise those emotions,</v>

1320
01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:50.264
<v Speaker 1>but only because it's clearly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and it's a little bit further </v>

1321
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the crooner in the club,</v>

1322
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>she's getting very near to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting you.</v>

1323
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.870
<v Speaker 1>This is her real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably some of the sadness in her</v>

1324
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:03.704
<v Speaker 1>life that you're immediately hearing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way in which some people like art </v>

1325
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>to be a safe space to exercise their </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

1326
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 1>As long as there's a bit distant from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1327
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.973
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be bad to have </v>

1328
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:15.654
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be bad to have </v>

1329
01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:17.304
<v Speaker 1>something side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be bad to have </v>

1330
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>something that's kind of powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also as a skirt.</v>

1331
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I think I can say that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristically English thing to want</v>

1332
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>to do a certain level of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1333
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.353
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living,</v>

1334
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>we're aloof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want your feelings and there.</v>

1335
01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:31.434
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott's very funny because they imagine </v>

1336
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>they're full of reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually full of passion and</v>

1337
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

1338
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>they get very wound up and worked up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel the strain between those two.</v>

1339
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:41.270
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>the English often volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of overt expression of emotions</v>

1341
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and yet we'll still go to an opera and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weep in a,</v>

1342
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's in a safe space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not,</v>

1343
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have to get up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to your neighbor immediately beside</v>

1344
01:11:56.461 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you when you were feeling a little raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotional.</v>

1345
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.633
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think also that expression of </v>

1346
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 1>exercising your taste again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1347
01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 1>people with terminal illnesses who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got limited periods of time,</v>

1348
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:13.583
<v Speaker 1>they often say they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to their everyday </v>

1349
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 1>experience and to the pattern of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The texture of it and a new way,</v>

1350
01:12:19.981 --> 01:12:20.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they instead of just putting the milk </v>

1351
01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:24.090
<v Speaker 1>bottle on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll put it into a jug.</v>

1352
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They'll want to sort of pour it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the cereal.</v>

1353
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Why make that effort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

1354
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:29.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have to wash out the drug </v>

1355
01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:34.040
<v Speaker 1>because it makes that particular moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>

1356
01:12:34.041 --> 01:12:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Brighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking after myself.</v>

1357
01:12:36.441 --> 01:12:37.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking care of each of these moments</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're precious and if we had </v>

1358
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.863
<v Speaker 1>endless amount of time to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing will be precious because we </v>

1359
01:12:44.541 --> 01:12:47.570
<v Speaker 1>could always do it later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can always do it at some other moment</v>

1360
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:48.763
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's being in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being aware of how you make the </v>

1361
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.840
<v Speaker 1>immediate environment and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment of others better.</v>

1362
01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

1363
01:12:55.931 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that makes me feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1364
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1365
01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.213
<v Speaker 2>To create somehow a kind of art </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout life to be reverential </v>

1366
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:06.234
<v Speaker 2>towards beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our our own beauty in the beauty of </v>

1367
01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:13.971
<v Speaker 2>others and that the senses can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments for measuring beauty.</v>

1368
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Not Tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

1369
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but ways in which we remediate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty in ourselves and others.</v>

1370
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And actually are really literally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with it.</v>

1371
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1372
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:26.703
<v Speaker 2>Literally in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where the external world is </v>

1373
01:13:28.151 --> 01:13:31.990
<v Speaker 2>entering our lives through these fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the portals.</v>

1374
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.570
<v Speaker 2>This is where we access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very beautiful.</v>

1375
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Just darkness and possibly a lighter </v>
<v Speaker 2>note though,</v>

1376
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:39.820
<v Speaker 2>it may not be your like a connoisseur of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>

1377
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You must be bloody good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1378
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:42.803
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always terrified of this question </v>

1379
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:45.234
<v Speaker 1>because the one thing that people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty good tasters and pretty </v>

1380
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:50.004
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about wine as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never want to say that they're </v>

1381
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>experts because they're also very easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>fooled.</v>

1382
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's from Tesco because it's two 99.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1383
01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I found this delicious tasting a belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a barrel.</v>

1384
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

1385
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Here's a nice story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about wine experts that I think is,</v>

1386
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.690
<v Speaker 1>is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1387
01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I talked to German who was a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1388
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somalia.</v>

1389
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>He won the championship world some lea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there he is looking after people in a</v>

1390
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:18.274
<v Speaker 1>restaurant with wines and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think you need to be a good </v>

1391
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Somalia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1392
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:23.464
<v Speaker 1>you probably imagined someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste any wine and tell you immediately </v>

1393
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>where it came from and who's venyard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what year or you think you're someone.</v>

1394
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>It's someone who will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1395
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Motto,</v>

1396
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>if this is what you're reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you should drink.</v>

1397
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you need is humility.</v>

1398
01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 1>You need modesty and humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1399
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:46.561
<v Speaker 1>because your job is to try to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the customer likes and wants and to</v>

1400
01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>help them to find something that's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them and good for them.</v>

1401
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

1402
01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day of the week I'll have to blind</v>

1403
01:14:54.401 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 1>taste and I will get a wine wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1404
01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 1>it will make me humble again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make me no.</v>

1405
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I still don't understand everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this world of wine.</v>

1406
01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And he talked about having a client who </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in to the restaurant,</v>

1407
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.070
<v Speaker 1>guy knew nothing about wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your does a a steak dish.</v>

1408
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:12.993
<v Speaker 1>And he picks up the wine list and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes through it and he finds a dessert </v>

1409
01:15:16.991 --> 01:15:18.650
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chateau de cam,</v>

1410
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 1>perhaps one of the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

1411
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 1>most beautiful wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

1412
01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a sweet dessert wine and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1413
01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he either knows the name or he's looking</v>

1414
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.210
<v Speaker 1>for an expensive wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he says,</v>

1415
01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the smelly lea didn't say,</v>

1416
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1417
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a dessert wine with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1418
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:35.283
<v Speaker 1>You want something from the Rhone or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Bordeaux and let me find it for </v>

1419
01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.613
<v Speaker 1>instead he came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to the sheriff and he came back </v>

1420
01:15:41.381 --> 01:15:45.000
<v Speaker 1>and he said to the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you're having the Chateau de cam,</v>

1421
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the chef thought that you might want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a for grass source.</v>

1422
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So they had changed the food to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something more acceptable,</v>

1423
01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>more suitable to go with the wine he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered and he said,</v>

1424
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.384
<v Speaker 1>and that guy now trusts me and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning more and he's becoming quite </v>

1425
01:16:00.341 --> 01:16:01.174
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost my advice and I think that's a </v>

1426
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>lovely story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't humiliate him.</v>

1427
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 1>He didn't show off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't sort of impose his knowledge.</v>

1428
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He find out what this guy wanted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was about.</v>

1429
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And then showed him gradually found ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show how do you match food and wines.</v>

1430
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I always want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>

1431
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.730
<v Speaker 1>if I'm trying to get people interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in wine,</v>

1432
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I do not want to do that thing that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>often we see where someone's standing at</v>

1433
01:16:30.161 --> 01:16:31.930
<v Speaker 1>the front of the room and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1434
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a particularly tight knit,</v>

1435
01:16:34.031 --> 01:16:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Clara it from the left bank.</v>

1436
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I think your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1437
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.113
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1438
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find it's showing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of maturation,</v>

1439
01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fantastic.</v>

1440
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And everybody in the room thinks I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what he's talking about.</v>

1441
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that and I'll never get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1442
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And they feel left out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead I think what I always want to</v>

1443
01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:54.670
<v Speaker 1>do is give people a chance to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about themselves while they're</v>

1444
01:16:54.671 --> 01:16:58.480
<v Speaker 1>having a wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hardest thing people do is,</v>

1445
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.780
<v Speaker 1>is getting a single glass and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it?</v>

1446
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.520
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1447
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

1448
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you see,</v>

1449
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.500
<v Speaker 1>can you say anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1450
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:11.240
<v Speaker 1>But now if you give people two glasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wine,</v>

1451
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>two glasses of different lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said try them both.</v>

1452
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Which do you prefer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the one on the right.</v>

1453
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Is it different from the one that left?</v>

1454
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

1455
01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:20.911
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1456
01:17:20.911 --> 01:17:21.744
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slightly more juicy or fruity or </v>

1457
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly more sour or the one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>light sour inside.</v>

1458
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:27.223
<v Speaker 1>Now they start comparing and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to understand something about </v>

1459
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:31.874
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the wine and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about what's going on in them </v>

1460
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and I love that because then when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about it,</v>

1461
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:40.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll go and pass it onto someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1462
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll get someone else to practice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try this and you say,</v>

1463
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>with our red wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of it?</v>

1464
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Or describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

1465
01:17:47.091 --> 01:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fruity and you can say,</v>

1466
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:49.664
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red fruits are black fruits and that's </v>

1467
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of an easy thing for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1468
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:57.140
<v Speaker 1>is it more blackberry black currant or </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it strawberry raspberry?</v>

1469
01:17:57.141 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 1>They can do that and now you just give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them choices and you get them to explore</v>

1470
01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:02.834
<v Speaker 1>and either exploring not just the wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're exploring their response and </v>

1471
01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:05.924
<v Speaker 1>reaction to it and you find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they like and what they don't like and </v>

1472
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 1>now they can choose better than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1473
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can now take an interest,</v>

1474
01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 1>they can go on and exploring for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1475
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1476
01:18:16.001 --> 01:18:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to give people the means to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1477
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.750
<v Speaker 2>quite early in that I realized that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>an alcoholic.</v>

1478
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:25.990
<v Speaker 2>No one do that to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take black fruit.</v>

1479
01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Red Fruit actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typically,</v>

1480
01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic.</v>

1481
01:18:32.691 --> 01:18:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1482
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.863
<v Speaker 2>a beautiful analogy for the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge in general that we have to </v>

1483
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:45.070
<v Speaker 2>invite people to have a degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority in their experience of sensual</v>

1484
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 2>world and the philosophical world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1485
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>only the things that there are words </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1486
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:51.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being described when you were talking </v>

1487
01:18:52.131 --> 01:18:52.964
<v Speaker 2>about one there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife wrote this brilliant book when </v>

1488
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:59.620
<v Speaker 2>we're before our daughter was born and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they in this book,</v>

1489
01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.513
<v Speaker 2>it was really excellent skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said it gave you the vocabulary for </v>

1490
01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>describing the types of sensation you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go through him.</v>

1491
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it burning?</v>

1492
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Is it stretching is in actually in sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of when it broke down the pain,</v>

1493
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.883
<v Speaker 2>it took away works that were very </v>
<v Speaker 2>generic and also catastrophic and </v>

1494
01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:24.821
<v Speaker 2>provided you with a means to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your experience is,</v>

1495
01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.073
<v Speaker 2>you that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think my wife certainly said it </v>

1496
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.460
<v Speaker 2>removed much of the fear around that</v>

1497
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:34.730
<v Speaker 1>probably became a connoisseur of her own</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

1498
01:19:34.731 --> 01:19:36.830
<v Speaker 1>She was interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like?</v>

1499
01:19:36.831 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Was it stinging?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was at burning?</v>

1500
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Was it stretching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it pulling in Sun and,</v>

1501
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.593
<v Speaker 1>and the more she's attending and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the particular texture </v>

1502
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:48.260
<v Speaker 1>the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just feeling the raw yuck of pain,</v>

1503
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the more you're able to cope and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>management is often about that.</v>

1504
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Getting people to actually pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

1505
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real we've and fabric and texture.</v>

1506
01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.113
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that neurologically that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because moving you to a different part </v>

1507
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>of your consciousness and possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>remove brain and uh,</v>

1508
01:20:02.991 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 2>and limiting distractions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:05.403
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's better to do that than just </v>

1510
01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 1>sedate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you kind of comatose.</v>

1511
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1512
01:20:09.261 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I really think pain management is </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult but,</v>

1513
01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:12.414
<v Speaker 2>but more attention rather than less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more discrimination rather than </v>

1514
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to manage it.</v>

1515
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:18.583
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
