00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>If you are not part of the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elite,</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>then whether you are being exploited or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you are irrelevant,</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't like those options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.133
<v Speaker 1>I would like to even increase smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still there is a big difference </v>

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>between exploitation and irrelevance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're exploited,</v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.703
<v Speaker 1>you're still powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are powerful as long as it to be </v>

7
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents in your rotation,</v>

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>they need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're exploited,</v>

9
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go on strike and they care about</v>

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>it because they need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need you to work in the factory,</v>

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>have to serve in the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're irrelevant,</v>

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>you are much less powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

13
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>People can't go on strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they go on strike,</v>

14
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't go on strike,</v>

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but you do need to organize now this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this narrative that the glorification,</v>

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.483
<v Speaker 1>the narrative where the worker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>central because their worker is </v>

17
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.013
<v Speaker 1>This narrative is constructed out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness but mainly in order to </v>

19
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>exploit the worker and whilst you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a personal sense of engagement of,</v>

20
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:04.944
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that guy with a sheaf of wheat </v>

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 1>ain't live grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still are simply a resource now,</v>

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.883
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are an important resource and have </v>

23
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saying on a spiritual level?</v>

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:19.564
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean from the point of view of the of </v>

26
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:21.794
<v Speaker 1>the political and economic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are important and the fact is they </v>

27
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:26.574
<v Speaker 1>do invest in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you live in a place like Nazi </v>

28
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're not a Jew or something</v>

29
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler would invest in your health,</v>

30
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>in your education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would build sewage systems in,</v>

31
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.961
<v Speaker 1>in the slums because Hitler needs you </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually to work in the factory and to</v>

32
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>serve as a soldier in the Wehrmacht.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

33
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Germany wants to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even within fascism,</v>

34
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.773
<v Speaker 1>aside from the obvious things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism that that needs to be rehashed </v>

35
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>because they sound sort of evidently a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>

36
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Annabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive thing about fascism,</v>

37
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>the ID,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea about us human beings </v>

38
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>functioning as a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not a lie.</v>

39
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not an exploitation that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitative in,</v>

40
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:10.804
<v Speaker 1>in the same way as a capitalist system </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploits people by selling the </v>

41
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we work?</v>

43
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>It would be good when really it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

44
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Your labor is a resource for us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism.</v>

45
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:21.354
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a sense that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>earnest belief that the included group </v>

46
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.683
<v Speaker 1>are valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not insincere and you're not being </v>

47
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.223
<v Speaker 1>duped or product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler wasn't going those stupid blonde </v>

48
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>blue eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He means he means it.</v>

49
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>It's sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

51
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the fact is it's really</v>

52
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly there is a domain,</v>

53
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>the sincerity of fascism or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sincerity of fascism,</v>

54
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:51.474
<v Speaker 1>of really caring about the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>German housewife and her children are </v>

55
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.983
<v Speaker 1>just a means to mobilize population to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit the needs of the powerful in the </v>

56
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

57
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it in fascism like in,</v>

58
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many other regimes.</v>

59
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.683
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are always the </v>

60
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>excluded excluded ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascism in order to function.</v>

61
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Fascism always needs enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And traitors.</v>

62
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>My list of potential ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

63
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of misunderstanding about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism,</v>

64
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.581
<v Speaker 1>which is I think one of the reasons you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a real resurgence of certain fascist</v>

65
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.454
<v Speaker 1>tendencies to danger for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the misunderstandings is that </v>

66
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of romanticism for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusive group and if you have enough,</v>

67
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:36.154
<v Speaker 1>this is just the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think that when we tried to and </v>

68
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.023
<v Speaker 1>after the Second World War we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a central theme in every </v>

69
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>education system in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>to warn people about fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we,</v>

71
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.373
<v Speaker 1>we didn't do a good enough job because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we presented fascism as a kind of </v>

72
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>monster and we vilified.</v>

73
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't explain what was attractive </v>

74
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was attractive about fascism is</v>

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>that he told people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

76
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>if you belong to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the right group,</v>

77
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>you are the most important thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

78
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>You are the most beautiful thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

79
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>When people looked in the Fascist Mirror</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 thirties,</v>

80
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>if a German in and looked in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did not see a monster.</v>

81
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>He sold the most beautiful thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

82
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.693
<v Speaker 1>This is why it was so attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable to the worker in the wheat </v>

83
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.864
<v Speaker 1>sheaf propaganda poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an identity that is meaningful </v>

84
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.254
<v Speaker 1>to your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your individual identity has value in </v>

85
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:38.704
<v Speaker 1>the collective identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's your area and looking in </v>

86
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>the mirror or your a communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toiling in the field or factory.</v>

87
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>You have purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have meaning.</v>

88
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.124
<v Speaker 1>They seems to be a resource that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important when organizing society or </v>

89
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

90
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and you know,</v>

91
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

92
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

93
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.003
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flatters people and people like to </v>

94
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>hear that sort of a human resource,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

95
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean when we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult,</v>

96
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.224
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when talking about extremist ideologies </v>

97
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:08.421
<v Speaker 1>such as fascism and communism as we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced it because as you just said,</v>

98
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>we extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we extract from.</v>

99
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>We don't include what must be attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and there is nothing wrong with</v>

100
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>people feeling purpose or valued in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>

101
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>There is something wrong with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecute in an but.</v>

102
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because we made this,</v>

103
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to warn people about fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did it.</v>

104
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>We didn't really explain what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>tempting about it.</v>

105
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Why do people go after it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like,</v>

106
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read Harry Potter,</v>

107
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>when I watched star wars or things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

108
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.084
<v Speaker 1>they always make the same mistake that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they depict the bed guys is just </v>

109
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>terrible and ugly and repulsive and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>are left with the sense,</v>

110
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>why would anybody follow voldemort?</v>

111
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody follow Darth vader?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

112
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>they are ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are mean even to their own.</v>

113
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>There are mean and cruel and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand what is seductive about</v>

114
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:02.804
<v Speaker 1>the dark side and the thing is the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>side is very seductive because for the </v>

115
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>people in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very beautiful.</v>

116
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look in the mirror,</v>

117
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you see the most beautiful thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

118
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
<v Speaker 1>This is something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Christian art understood </v>

119
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.333
<v Speaker 1>much better than modern science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean that the devil would be </v>

120
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The devil is beautiful.</v>

121
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

122
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.933
<v Speaker 1>who would it be tempted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have an intelligent oration </v>

123
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>that grew up with the idea of fascism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ugliest thing in the world.</v>

124
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.693
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they start to adopt fascist ideas </v>

125
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>and they look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the CS,</v>

126
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.393
<v Speaker 1>not a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they see is something very </v>

127
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

128
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they reached the conclusion we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be fascist.</v>

129
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.131
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

130
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you want people to be vegetarian,</v>

131
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say bacon tasted awful.</v>

132
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.673
<v Speaker 1>You have to go look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon's great where we just can't eat </v>

133
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You okay?</v>

134
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And the same with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look heroin,</v>

135
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.903
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sorry we can't take care of in </v>

136
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's off the agenda and what?</v>

137
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Those things are resourced by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His pleasure,</v>

138
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

139
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>These energies are attractive or these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>

140
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they move through our consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

141
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>they all have at some point interacted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with human consciousness.</v>

142
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>They are an expression of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

143
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.684
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be universal's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There seem to be perennial themes that </v>

144
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>are emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to belong to the collective.</v>

145
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 1>We want to feel valued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to feel purposeful,</v>

146
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>antithetical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

147
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.783
<v Speaker 1>the dystopia that you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a useful class will vein flight </v>

148
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>and to an unmanageable degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

149
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Then when we're looking at the systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have failed and the systems they're</v>

150
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>succeeding and what we have learned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're beginning to understand,</v>

151
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.013
<v Speaker 1>it isn't our obligation to begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>present alternative ideas that somehow </v>

152
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.114
<v Speaker 1>embrace these ideas of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a essence and where possible throw off </v>

153
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the imaginary shackles of the systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preexisting requirements I eat.</v>

154
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Your value is as a worker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single one of us in this room </v>

155
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>right now is here because of our value </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a worker.</v>

156
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>You May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenny,</v>

157
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>every single person he is being paid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be here,</v>

158
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>right one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

159
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you love your husband got your </v>

160
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.753
<v Speaker 1>husband's in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've already made these come up </v>

161
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>all the best buy beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

162
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like none of us or like the most </v>

163
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>important things in my life are not my </v>
<v Speaker 1>values as a man doing a podcast.</v>

164
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my children,</v>

165
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 1>my wife and all human beings know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

166
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>that love is something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized through work but need not be.</v>

167
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And often is it.</v>
