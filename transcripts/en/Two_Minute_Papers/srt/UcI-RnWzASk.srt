1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so why don't we get started. These,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,780
I will show you some of the small paint
contest assignments from previous years.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,300
Is this, is this visible, is this,

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,250
I think I should pull some of the current,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,940
maybe a
bit

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,523
about that.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,780
So you can see that even with a smoking
program you can be can make incredible,

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,650
incredible scenes.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,810
So this is the thanks.
So this is the state of the art lecture.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,020
Basically what we are interested in this
and the next lecture is starting from

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,440
the very first algorithm that was ever
created to solve the rendering equation,

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,600
the classical path tracer up to
the most sophisticated works,

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,010
some of them which came
out less than a week ago.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,380
And I won't go into deep mathematical
details for most of these techniques.

15
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:12,430
What I would like you to know is the
basic idea and the intuition behind the

16
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,830
method and why we are
doing the things we do.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,070
So deep mathematical details will also
be there in the form of links where you

18
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:27,181
can look behind the curtain and you will
see what is exactly going on in there.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,290
Now before we start with
the state of the art park,

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,610
there's a few things that we need
to discuss. One, this person.

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,150
So we have talked about
indices of refraction,

22
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,350
the index of refraction for
different materials. What was it?

23
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,640
It was a number.
So in every code,

24
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:53,900
in every program, in every
theory, we use numbers. Well,

25
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,260
in reality in this is of
refractions are not numbers.

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,360
They are in fact functions.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,910
What does it mean?

28
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,230
They could be functions that depend
on the wavelength of incoming light.

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,530
And what it exactly means is that there
are materials that refract incoming

30
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:19,070
light of different colors
to different directions.

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,790
And that's quite profound because

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,360
you will see the beautiful effects
of diff dispersion and second,

33
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,170
and there are also some supplementary
videos that you should take a look at all.

34
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,290
This is a good example of it.
This is a prison.

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,380
So you can see that the incoming light
is white and the prison does break down

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
to this white incoming light to
all possible parlors. There are

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,670
another good example of this is rainbows.

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,320
So whenever you are on a family trip and
they are asking what you're looking at

39
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:59,980
and if you accidentally
don't say rainbow you will,

40
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:04,690
you will maybe say this person and
they will put you in an asylum instead.

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,640
So, but don't worry, you
are correct scientifically
and that's all that matters.

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,040
You can also see and maybe
not so beneficial and not
so beautiful effect of this

43
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,740
person.
It is called chromatic aberration.

44
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,130
This means that we have a camera lens
that is possibly not the highest quality

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,330
and it can introduce artifacts like this
because different colors of light are

46
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,110
reflected into different directions and
you don't get the sharp initial that you

47
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,540
would be looking for.
Wow.

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
This is a dispersion
rendered inside lux renders.

49
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,410
So you can see that with
physically based rendering,

50
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:51,030
you can actually capture this effect
and you can also render timelines.

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,060
So if y'all have a fiance and you would
like to buy a rink but you're broke

52
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,350
because her university student,
then you can just render one.

53
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,680
Then you can also render
one with this person.

54
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,460
But see if you have a nerd girlfriend.

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,470
Because if salt and maybe she will be
happy about it and most people aren't and

56
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,520
I speak from experience

57
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,050
and you can also see this really
beautiful effect in the old old pink Floyd

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,690
album cover called the
dark side of the moon.

59
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,510
There are also some videos about this in
the internet rendered with Lux render.

60
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,440
Take a look. No. The first question is,

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,650
is the index of refraction
of glass constant?

62
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,350
Well let's look it up.

63
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,530
Obviously we may have glasses that are
made and manufactured in different ways.

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,820
There are,
most of them are not completely clear.

65
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,790
They are some kind of
some kinds of a mixture.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,980
So there are different kinds of class.

67
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:01,900
But let's just pick one randomly from
a database that gives you in this of

68
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,190
refraction and you can see
that it is actually not flat.

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,200
It is not a constant there. There's
something happening in the function.

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
So this means that there are glass tops
that have dispersion effects and even

71
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,300
only slightly because you can see that
we have between the minimum and the

72
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,540
maximum, there is not such a large
difference, but there is something.

73
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,870
So you could say that at least this
kind of glass introduces some degree of

74
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,910
dispersion.
So let's take a look.

75
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,370
What do you think about this
image that's this caustic,

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,420
have any kind of dispersion effect
or does it not? What do you think?

77
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,140
Is it a bit more colorful around
the edges or is it completely wild?

78
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,280
Exactly.
Did you read

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,640
okay, could good bit gift.
Give me one more opinion.

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,273
What do you think

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,990
it's
okay.

82
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,930
Uh, it might be a rainbow but it may be
significantly smaller so maybe you would

83
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:27,760
have to zoom in really close to seed
or angel. So this is up for debate.

84
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,820
We could see that the IOR seems to be non
constant and therefore there should be

85
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:34,510
a dispersion effect.

86
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,490
Some artists claim that they can spot
the difference between a physical based

87
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,210
render.

88
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,210
Even for materials like that and simple
RGB rendering where you cannot render

89
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,670
these dispersion affects correctly. This
is up for debate whether you can see it,

90
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,720
but science says that yes there is.
Even if there is a slight difference,

91
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,010
there is a difference.

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,330
It feel right to more know
more about this person.

93
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,130
There is this wonderful series
called cosmos, a spacetime Odyssey.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Have any of you heard of this before?
Raise your hand.

95
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,380
Okay. If you are, feel
so. This is, this is,

96
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:18,610
this is hosted by the
magnificent Neil degrasse Tyson.

97
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,930
Yeah,

98
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,160
Neil degrasse Tyson and you
should absolutely watch it.

99
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,400
So everyone who hasn't watched it yet,

100
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,690
I'd like to hear your excuse or at least
I like to hear that you will go home

101
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:33,820
and watch it.
So this,

102
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:38,821
this episode is about that this Persian
mostly and we will know all about this

103
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,210
person if you want.
Okay.

104
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,020
Now we have another question because
we have written an RGB render.

105
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,140
So we if if you look up the source
code of small paint everywhere,

106
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,550
you just see RGB, RGB, RGB.

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,480
How do we write a correct
physically based render?

108
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,000
And even before that,

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,380
how do we even represent
light in the visible spectrum?

110
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Not a good answer to this is to introduce
a function that describes how much

111
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,250
light is carried at different wavelengths.

112
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,900
Now this will be a continuous function
that we could call spectral power

113
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:20,734
distribution.

114
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,170
And you can see that at
these lower wavelength,

115
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,100
there is not too much light carried on
the higher wavelength there. There's more.

116
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,540
So you can put this
representation into your render,

117
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,040
and what you would do is that
you would just a knife solution,

118
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:43,870
you would pick a randomly
chosen wavelength and you
would trace way into the

119
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:48,520
scene using this way of life.
And if you do this,

120
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:53,521
you can actually do another kind of Monte
Carlo integration because you also add

121
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,570
one more dimension of integration.

122
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,210
And this one more dimension
would be overweight lens

123
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,450
because you would also be,

124
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,830
still has stickily taking random samples
of the rendering equation for a given

125
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,390
wave flags in a given collar.

126
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,110
And then you would need to sum it up
somehow to get a sensible solution.

127
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,470
There's more about this
in PBR t chapter five.

128
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay.
