1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's go with a simplified
version of the whole thing.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:08,070
We're gonna talk about
simplify BRDF mouse. Well,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,840
there's going to be the MBN BRDF.
How does it look like? Well first,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,710
first on the last side,
I see I,

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,460
this is intensity. Well
what is this? Well,

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,890
no one knows because we have not radiance,

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,540
not something very physical here.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,170
This is going to be the simplified
version of the whole rendering equation.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,060
Basically a bunch of packs. If you love
something that is vastly simplified,

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,020
it doesn't really have a physical meaning.
It doesn't have physical units,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,590
but it works. It's beautiful and it's a
good way to understand what's going on.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,820
So the intensity that we
measure is going to be an NBN,

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,610
the product of an MBN
coefficient of an object.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,310
This is dependent of the
object. This means that, uh,

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,910
this means something like
the color of the object

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,160
and the eye is going to be the intensity,

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,170
the ambient intensity of a scene
or the light source. And uh,

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,300
later on you're going to be talking
about why this is interesting.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,540
So this is an example.
We have a blue object over here.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,060
And it's the same color everywhere.
Why?

21
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,010
Because the farm in 1000
depends on anything.

22
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:25,011
There's just one for efficient that's
multiplied by this intensity of the scene.

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,850
So that's an NBN shading.
Uh, what else is dark?

24
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,350
There's the diffuse BRDF.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,950
This is what we compute
is a diffuse coefficient.

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,840
What is the diffuse color?
The diffuse Albido of this thing.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,510
And there's going to be a product ofL
and. M. This is what we did before.

28
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,240
Do you feels objects look like that?
Uh,

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,470
please raise your hand if you have ever
done any kind of diffuse lung version

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,050
model in graphics. Okay, excellent. Great.

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,220
And just another thing, this, uh,

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
diffuse cooperation is the very least RGB.
Okay.

33
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,841
So this is how much light is not absorbed
on every different wavelength because

34
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:15,900
I cannot describe collars in one number
at the very least RGV or a continuous

35
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,990
spectrum
just for the record.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,260
And now it's looking better because I
can more or less see where the light

37
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,220
source is with for this fuel shading.
Uh,

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,960
there's also a specular BRDF
when I compute is the V. Dot.

39
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,090
Hard times of specular coefficient.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,320
And v is the vector pointing towards
the viewer. And our is to reflected,

41
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,080
there's going to be examples of that.

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,170
So just that you see the formula and
there's an l which has a shyness factor,

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,840
uh, in the next assignment you
will play with this yourself.

44
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,940
So for now I will keep this a secret,

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,270
but this exact with us and what side we're
going to junk food is because I would

46
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,790
like to ask a question later
on and you're going to find out

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,760
the solution. Excuse me. So this is
how the specular highlights look.

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,190
And if I add up all of these things
MBL and diffused and specular,

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,370
I get some complex looking,

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,680
a model that looks something that is,

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,730
that approximates a physical reality.

52
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,550
So I just simply add all
these terms of, uh, okay,

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,580
well I have something like this here
and I have on purpose removed the light

54
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,860
source from this image.

55
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,550
But probably everyone can tell where
the light source is expected to be.

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,320
All right, so raise your hand if
you know her the lies or should be.

57
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,710
Okay, cool. Where should it be?

58
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,740
Above exactly.
Exactly.

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,760
So it's going to be above is fierce
and this is exactly where it is.

60
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,870
So these material models are
descriptive in the way he does that.

61
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,110
I get images that have some physical
meaning that resemble physical reality.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,560
Well, let's, let's take a
look at an actual example. Uh,

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,070
the question is what would
this region look like?

64
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,600
The one that I marked like this pixel,
if pixels existed in the real world,

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,123
uh,

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,900
would it look the same if I moved my head
in reality and that sound that sounds

67
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,640
like you know, this, it
sounds like a tricky question.
Yeah, I have seen the answer.

68
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,230
Yes. Uh, well, uh, let's say that
this part is purely the fuse.

69
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,700
I don't see many specular reflections
in there. The fuse is l. Dot. M.

70
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,030
So light, lighter
direction, times to normal.

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,070
Does it change if I move my head?
Well, how do I answer this question?

72
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,120
You don't really need to see what
is in an equation. You are off. You,

73
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,750
you have to be aware of
what is not in there.

74
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,010
Does it change if I move my head,
raise your hand if you know the answer.

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,940
It's very apparent on many or few.
Yes,

76
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,610
yes. The change. If I
move with them, okay,

77
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm going to change because the
specularity might move. Yes, that's,

78
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,160
that's very true. So it doesn't change
because we know that it doesn't change.

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,780
I mean the walls look the same.
Uh, if I, if I move around,

80
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,690
I mean not talking about shapes,
I'm talking about collars.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,310
They don't change and mirror.
However it does change. Uh,

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,180
and the mathematical reason for this is
that the view direction is not in this

83
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:43,691
equation.

84
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,700
I can change the view of their actual
all I want and nothing will change in the

85
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:48,550
diffuse to be out here.

86
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,910
So this is like a general mathematical,

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,010
a trick or,
uh,

88
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,200
principles that you can use in a
number of different things. Don't just,

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,590
don't just look at what
variables are in there. Uh,

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,390
tried to think of variables,
what you would imagine that
would be there and okay,

91
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,390
why are they missing? And
that's, that's also information.

92
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:18,680
That's what they're not the only one
stamp at what is missing is valuable

93
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,940
information. So what about these
regions? These are specular highlights.

94
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,680
These are described by the
specular BRDF V. Dot. R.

95
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:31,681
So view indirection times there are
reflected a light direction and let's

96
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,830
actually compute what's going on.
So I would be interested in the intensity,

97
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:41,780
this fake something of this point
where this is a delight vector.

98
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,980
This is where it points to,

99
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
it is probably reflected somewhere there
because it comes in and it's an ideal

100
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,520
reflections. So it's gonna be
reflected in this direction.

101
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,940
And this is where I am just for example.

102
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,910
So I'm interested in V. Dot. R.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,200
Well this is going to be a cosign.
Uh,

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,930
there is a small angle between the Emr.

105
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,790
So if there's a small lag
loan that's course sign of
a small number that's large,

106
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,690
that's goes to one

107
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,820
and that's going to be a huge
scalar product. Therefore,

108
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,810
this point is bright and
this is indeed broke.

109
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,760
And the question is, which is a
very easy to insert in a second,

110
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,920
is does it change if I move around,
does it change?

111
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,790
Obviously it does change
because v is in the equation.

112
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,240
And if I change this around in different,
uh,

113
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,920
for the specular BRDF,

114
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,150
this is going to be bright and just one
of my favorite intuitions of this leader

115
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,130
arm because otherwise
this is just letters.

116
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,670
This means how much am I
standing in the way of the life?

117
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,630
So a life lesson,

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,090
if you can't find the water droplets
on the floor after having a shower,

119
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,750
move your head around because that
specular if the windshield of a car is too

120
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:10,130
bright and it's, and you just can't take
it anymore, move your head around this,

121
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:14,030
this, this connects to the
physical reality around us.

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,440
And that's good tips in case you didn't
know that you need to move your hand

123
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:23,330
around, you brought down,
oh, now you're low. Okay.

124
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,920
So, uh, this is the, the,

125
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:30,800
the point where we can just for a second
stop and marvel at how beautiful things

126
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,801
we can create with such simple equations
and they're under a new equation is

127
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,180
going to be even looking to fold in
that lane infinitely more beautiful.

128
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,770
And there is some additional
beauty that you can think about.

129
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,590
And when you look at images like that,
okay, how will I shape this point?

130
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,430
Is this diffuse? If is the
specular, why does it look the way?

131
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,040
So you can,
if you nothing better to do.

132
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,360
You can think about these things
when on public transport, uh,

133
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,940
let's call this thing that
illumination equation.

134
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,940
This is the faith simpler version
of the rendering equation.

135
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,680
Now what is in there? Most of this
is familiar days and MBN chain term.

136
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,470
And then there's the diffuse l.
Dot.

137
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,471
M there is the specular veto are we add
all these together and we multiply this

138
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,950
by the amount of incoming light because
if there's no light sources in the scene,

139
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,770
there is no light.
Light is not coming from anywhere.

140
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,690
Therefore this is all divided by zero.

141
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,540
If there's a bright light
source that things get brighter.

142
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,480
So we multiply by this incoming light.

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,760
And what is important to know is that
this is only the direct effect of light

144
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:42,060
sources. Uh, this sounds a
bit esoteric at the moment,

145
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,490
but later on a few lectures down the road,

146
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,750
we're going to be all about indirect
illumination and Moody's life.

147
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:52,500
That and this is neglected and the
MBM term is used to make up for it.

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You will see examples of this in
the next lecture and this is a crude

149
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,700
approximation but it's still beautiful.

150
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:04,701
It's easy to understand and it serves
as a stepping stone to solve the real

151
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:07,140
vendor mission.
Uh,

152
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,170
but this has not done one thing is that
if there are multiple light sources,

153
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,460
the scene is expected to be brighter.

154
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,120
So I would compute the whole
thing for multiple light sources.

155
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:23,121
So there's going to be a sum in there and
the inside the some lists that indexes

156
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,550
are the number of light sources.
Basically just,

157
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,320
I just didn't want to overcomplicate this.
Uh,

158
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,450
but still something is still
missing. This is, this is not done.

159
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,500
I arrived to a point,

160
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I compute this specular ambient and
diffuse shading and I am not done.

161
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's discuss how ray tracing
works and we'll find out.

162
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,220
So the first thing is that what you see
here is non trivial because what you

163
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:54,771
would imagine is that you start shooting
grace from the light source and then

164
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,910
some of the rays would make
up to make it to the camera,

165
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,120
to your eye and,
and most of them won't.

166
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,770
So we go with a simple,
uh,

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,950
optimization that we turned
the whole thing around.

168
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,800
And then we start tracing
grace from the camera.

169
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,200
Because if I start racing from there,

170
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,050
I can guarantee that I deem it raised
that are not wasted because the,

171
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,170
I'm not interested in the light
rays to not make it to the camera.

172
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,490
So if I started from there,

173
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,520
I can guarantee that this is
not wasted to computation.

174
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,810
So how do we do this?
There is this camera plane,

175
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,410
we will discuss how to construct such a
thing and we construct race through this

176
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,130
camera plane.

177
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,200
And what I'm interested in
is the projection of the
three d world to display.

178
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,030
This is what you will see on your monitor.

179
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,810
So I should raise from this camera and I
intersect this against objects that are

180
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:58,690
in the scene. I want to know where
is the light stopping, where,

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,900
what objects does it hit and
where does it get reflected?

182
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,770
So the second is
intersection with an objects.

183
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,160
I have to realize that it hits
this sphere. Then I stopped there.

184
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,850
I compute the Basie shaming turns
like the diffuse and the rest,

185
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,580
and then I don't stop there,
but I'm interested in where
the light is reflected.

186
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,180
I need to continue from
here and this light,

187
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,080
this light lightweight,
maybe reflected or refracted,

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,700
and I need some kind of recursion
in order to come from that for that.

189
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,160
And the recursion works
in the following way.

190
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,910
I stop at this point where I hit the ball,
the sphere,

191
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,480
and what I do is that I imagined that
this is now the starting point of the rain

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,120
and I'm shooting very outwards and I
start this ray tracing algorithm again.

193
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,290
So this is how the recursion works.

194
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,590
This was missing from the formula,

195
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,800
and this is just what the text version
of what I have set for those who are

196
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:04,310
reading this at home. And you're going
to deal with reflections for stuff.
