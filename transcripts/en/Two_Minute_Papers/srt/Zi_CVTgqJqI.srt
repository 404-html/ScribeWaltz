1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,500
Okay,
let's,

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,950
let's quickly study how to compete surface
marbles because we are going to need

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,140
that.
If you remember the diagrams,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,320
we always had the surface from a diffuse
specular and the ambient shading.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,350
And just a quick remark,

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,090
in the previous lecture we have talked
about diffuse inspecting your shading and

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,070
also MBN.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,990
But these are perhaps the most important
was what does simplify the rds.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,090
The idea falls and you
can see them everywhere.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,890
So when you are on public transport you
can think about what objects could be,

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,660
what exact case I'm objects or
like a mixture of these BRDF moms.

12
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,180
It is possible that I have a diffuse
object with a glossy or respect,

13
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,840
a little coating on top of it.

14
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:50,841
And you can move your head around like I
told you before and and see how the new

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,230
cost,
the object changes.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,740
So a lot of beauty to Margo app and you
will be able to also understand that for

17
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,221
instance,

18
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:04,221
if you watch someone performing stand
up comedy is that are usually uh,

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
a law of guys seem to Morris things and
they all always we'd wear makeup and the

20
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,890
makeup artist tells them that, yes, you
need to wear makeup. And the artist says,

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,890
I'm a manly guy, I don't want to wear
makeup. And they say, well, I don't care.

22
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:26,360
You have to because otherwise
you are sparkly. Okay.

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,710
And this means that they start sweating
and if they start sweating that the skin

24
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:36,120
is going to get a bit
already and then specular,

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,270
it's more specular.

26
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:43,200
Sweet means that if I turned my head
around it go look a bit different.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,540
So there's going to be specular
highlights and if you use makeup dandies

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,630
specular highlights disappear and the
whole face is going to be almost perfectly

29
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:56,390
diffused. Therefore it doesn't
distract your audience.

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,150
So trust parties everywhere.

31
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,820
So if you ever wear makeup,

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,750
then think about this
specular reflections.

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,750
Okay? But I digress. So surface normals.
I haven't even visited equation F of x,

34
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:16,520
y zero I would like to know
the normals of the surface,

35
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:21,170
how to construct a normal well [inaudible]
is given by the 20th of the function.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,290
And just a quick,
yeah,

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,820
just a quick reminder to
Craig went off the function.

38
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,890
This is a three d function of x,
Y,

39
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:35,480
Z and the gradient when every quarter
that gives you the derivative of the

40
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:39,100
function with respect to a given quarter.
Okay,

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,390
let's see an example.
Imagine Elliptic parable out.

42
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,970
You don't have to imagine that
because there's going to be an image,

43
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,750
so this is x squared
over a squared and so on.

44
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:55,700
I'm not going to read formula and this
is how it looks like and if I would like

45
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,050
to put together something like this,

46
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,790
then I have to know that a and B are the
curvatures of this thing in different

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,880
different dimensions and therefore
these values are scalar values.

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,211
Well,

49
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:12,211
let's compute the surface normal of
this elliptic paraboloid but this would

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,580
include differentiating the whole equation
for the first coordinate with respect

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,750
to x. So let's differentiate
this with respect to x,

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,900
but x squared is going to be two x and
eight squared is going to remain there

53
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,640
because it's a Schema.
Multiply it.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,370
Why does it depend on x?
It doesn't depend on the next effort.

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,930
False off z.
It doesn't depend on x.

56
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Therefore the first quarter
will be two x over a squared.

57
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,670
What about the second term?

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,080
The second term because the function
differentiated with respect to why. Okay.

59
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,460
Does x dependent, why no, it's turn
is going to be zero. What about this?

60
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,440
Why is crime is going to be too wide over
[inaudible]? Z doesn't depend on why.

61
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,570
Therefore this is going
to be the second term.

62
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,460
What about the third time I differentiate
is function with respect to z. Z,

63
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,680
does it depend on x?
Someone let me know.

64
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,890
I mean correct. It doesn't depend
on him. Does it depend on why?

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,420
Well, what's going to be
the type of this expression?

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,110
It's going to be minus a bit louder.

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,060
It's going to be minus
one. Okay. Let's see. Okay,

68
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,980
we got this so we can cause track the
social snowman off an elliptic parabolic.

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,110
Excellent.

70
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,700
So when we do this intersection
routine in ray tracing,

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,140
I have a way,

72
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,980
and I would like to intersect this
against every single object that is in the

73
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:45,814
room.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,240
The question is what is the
first object that the ray hits?

75
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,750
Which intersection am I interested in?
So

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,030
that may be men.
So if I lose summer,

77
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,650
I may intersect many different objects.

78
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:09,651
But if things are not translucent or
things aren't transparent that I'm only

79
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,830
going to see the first
intersection and that's it.

80
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,770
And the first should be the closest.

81
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,650
So this should be easy because we
are using parametric equations,

82
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,960
they depend on t and t is the distance.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,750
So basically what we get as an output,

84
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,610
this is going to be a list of
t values that our interests,

85
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,060
I am intersecting these
objects at least of taste five,

86
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:40,890
10 miles to things like that.
What the question is,

87
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,020
which one do I choose out of this
list of teas? Simon, help me out.

88
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,990
Smiles.
I wasn't too t the smallest positive team.

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,880
Amy. So the negative ones
are not interested in like
I told you, long politics,

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,250
politics,
free zone.

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,600
And I wrote to be interested
in the smallest positive t.

92
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,670
There's those moments, true negative
teas we are not interested in.

93
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:12,410
We have discussed this and the
question is can we take t equals zero?

94
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,610
And I'm not telling this because I would
be an annoying mathematician only half

95
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,070
metal edition and Land Wunderkinder.
Okay,

96
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,310
so I'm asking this because I
would be annoyed with addition.

97
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,230
I'm asking this because this is going
to happen if you're right or a tracer.

98
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,590
So lots of people are it all something
is not working when I have no idea what

99
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,650
went wrong.

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,650
It is possible that t equals zero
and we need to handle this case.

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,530
So just a second,
raise your hand if you,

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,400
if you mow equals zero means intersection.
Okay,

103
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,870
excellent. I will have
some of my own destiny, so

104
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,900
okay. Yeah. Just a minute ago.

105
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,740
Okay. Yeah. Ask Her name. Okay,

106
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,310
so what's happening with the team to zero?
Sorry.

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,800
Yes,
exactly.

108
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:21,801
So if we have some amount
of bounces equals zero this
means that I am exactly on

109
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:27,330
the surface of the object
that I'm bouncing off of.

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,130
So if I intersect,

111
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,170
the guest is sphere and I bounced or a
bag the next after the next intersection

112
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,610
routine, I am almost guaranteed
to see machine precision matters.

113
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:43,611
But mathematically I'm guaranteed a CTO
or CEO because it's south intersection.

114
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,320
The raid comes to this direction,

115
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,170
bounces back from the table,

116
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,040
but it is for the top of the team where
there's going to be like a trivial

117
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,160
intersection which is from
the starting point of direct.

118
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,900
So we are not interested in
this so we are going to take

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,970
the smallest negative and non zero t.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,240
So in cold we usually put there in epsilon
like a very small number and we say

121
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,010
that if it's the very least this lumber,

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,550
then I will take the intersection because
it's not self intersection anymore.

123
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,640
Okay. After we buy just
a smell, beauty break,

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,780
this is an image rendered with lux render,
our glorious renderer.

125
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,200
We are going to use this
later during the course. Okay.

126
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,070
And some more motivation will be
able to compute images like that.

127
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,090
Isn't this beautiful

128
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,820
random photo that's cheating?

129
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,820
Well,
if you're in the mood to a model,

130
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,640
like an extremely high Polycarp seizure,

131
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,690
yeah, people do that
too. And yeah, but it,

132
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,040
it gives you a really
realistic lighting off to seat.

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,090
You can, you can use this thing in a later
assignment to create beautiful images.

134
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:14,310
By the way, there's a course
gallery, make sure to take a look,

135
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,630
because from previous years
people have created some amazing,

136
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:23,100
amazing, uh, seeds. Raise your hand
if you have seen in this gallery.

137
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,650
Okay. From the people who are the
people who haven't seen, it's your hand.

138
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,190
If you are going to take a look at this
after every course. Okay, excellent.

139
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,230
You know, I didn't, I
didn't see your hand.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,090
You have, you have an apple,
but you have to be serious.

141
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,460
There's some amazing things.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,420
I wouldn't say some people should have
gone artists instead because this would

143
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,290
say something about their knowledge and
it's lack of place at all because these

144
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,270
terms are really smart guys,

145
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,980
but they have some amazing artistic
skills and I'm sure that there are some

146
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,950
artists inside,
some of you as well.
