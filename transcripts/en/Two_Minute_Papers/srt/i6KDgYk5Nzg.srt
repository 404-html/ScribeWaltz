1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,120
Let's take a look at how the
exact that really looks like

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,570
I have a recursive function where what
I'm looking for first is if I have

3
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,900
reached the maximum depth
that I would like to,

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,190
if I say that I would drive to them there
by volunteers and this is going to be

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,020
fine. Did I did that? I reach
this number of policies? Yes.

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,260
Okay. Done. Just top at the time of
that and that all will be is the space

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,610
that what I'm looking for these,

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,610
the nearest intersection you
remember from the previous lecture,

9
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,580
that means I with actually before yours,
which I sold eat.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
So what I'm just did,
he said,

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,440
I am intersecting a lot of objects and
I'm only interested in the very first

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,383
intersection

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,350
and if I didn't take anything then I will
be to a black color because there's no

14
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,060
energy.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,800
Oh boy. Uh, in this room,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,200
wow.
If I have the intersection of the object,

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,540
I will be interested in the ignition
and the material of this object and we

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,540
shouldn't means that if this is a light
source that is going to happen and the

19
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,140
material can be RB,
the RDF,

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,180
it feels philosophy or some complicated

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,863
[inaudible]

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,730
material. This, I'm going to
store on that. What's up next?

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,360
Well, I went back to
construct a new, right.

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,950
You guess I would face the next grade
so I can I is that she has a low rate.

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,120
This was start wherever
I think this object,

26
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:41,121
so if I keep them feeble I will create
a new radar starts on the people and I

27
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:45,580
will set the outgoing direction
according to Samhsa, the up.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,050
Let's see that what they have here.

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,510
If it says it's random and you need to
back already he have a sphere ball where

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,700
the object was.
It sounds like it'd be a few speed for me,

31
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,640
so I generate the random
you'll need factor is,

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,460
and this is going to be the outgoing,
correct.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,950
Now let's add together the
elements of the random equation.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,040
I have the cosign that you thought
was just the light attenuation.

35
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,410
I have to be already at term.
And even the BRDF term,

36
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:18,930
it seems that here they have also
included is the the art, which is the lie,

37
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,490
that animation.
This is the veto of the material.

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,890
Okay,

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,910
how much light is absorbed
and how much it's reflected.

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,690
And then what I would like to do is I
want to call the very same function that

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,730
you see the
well number one.

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,860
So this is a recursive function.

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,660
I would start the same process again
with the new grade, those starting point

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,290
and he'd be out if I had
phrased a sufficient number
of race time exit this week,

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,193
Persia,

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,550
I collect the result of this in this
variable that's called reflected.

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,770
And in the end,
this is the elegant and patient.

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,880
Rather than get Queneisha [inaudible],

49
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,350
he l me plus the integrated option,

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,390
which is the BRDF times,
uh,

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,210
this reflected which is older,
the personal terms,

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,670
what do you mean stuff out this way?

53
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,890
We have these here and there's
going to be many subsequent boxes.

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,810
And I ended up all this energy
input reflected in family life.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,320
So this is a pseudo false,
this is not,

56
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,270
this is not something that you should
fight the file or anything like that,

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,740
but this is what we bill the code.
Do you need done next lecture?

58
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,580
This is just a schematic overview
review on what is happening exactly.

59
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,090
It's like who do you shoot away,

60
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,140
you bounce it to the scene and then we
hopefully get the light sources and even

61
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:51,200
if we hit the lights
or should we continue?

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,400
Do you think the light
source is important?

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,040
Because this is where
we short term passport.

64
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,000
Let me show you what's what's going on.
If we don't need light sources.

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,290
So is Lee is the initial
term on the left side here.

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,180
So we add this to the help
resolve every coach stuff.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,840
And a fundamental question is that if we
have a long life path that doesn't keep

68
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,650
the light source,
we are using completely random stuff.

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,930
Maybe sauce mark important.
Stop me.

70
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,990
Well yeah he never, they're
never happy submission. Okay.

71
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,480
What does this mean?
That the regions that we,

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,630
we give we get from the
program is going to be zero.

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,220
So the Corolla or you have
this is that won't be,

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,950
you won't get food from all
the lighthouse that keep alive.

75
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,670
So if you don't get the lights off,

76
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,960
you don't know where the light is
coming from. So you will be a black. So,

77
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,900
and this is obviously a really bad and
because you're computing churning out

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,100
samples out samples and samples perhaps
on your Gpu, but then it doesn't fit

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,520
the fact the QT or effect of all simple
life path crazy is that if you have a

80
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,940
small light source,
if Americans off yours,

81
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,050
you're finally just going to be slower.

82
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,373
Why

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,360
smaller light sources more Merriam's
stolen those Benito run the race,

84
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,700
the load source smaller than you
want to do this. Exactly. Exactly.

85
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Be less for a small life and up to the
extreme where we have at 0.5 source and

86
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:53,250
if we have a point back source then we'll
see that we will be in trouble because

87
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,810
what I would expect from my officers to
return something like what we imagined

88
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,330
the point light source.
Yeah,

89
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,830
but this is not what we will end up with

90
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,950
so I wouldn't expect him to
return the correct results.

91
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,060
Many people have reported many
forums on the Internet that hey,

92
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:16,410
I implemented it but this is what I got.

93
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,461
Wow,
this,

94
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:23,140
this doesn't work at all on
all these pronounced law.

95
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,680
So now it's a little tunnel inflection,

96
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,300
wanting cower individually
for a black image.

97
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,540
I mean I could generate this
with five months of c plus plus.

98
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,400
Why? Why do we even bother?
We will get nothing.

99
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,710
Why is that point light
source like image quiet.

100
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,943
Okay.

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,280
Yes,
exactly.

102
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,750
Exactly.
Sort of point

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,780
represents a location in mathematics.
He doesn't not have area,

104
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,020
so technically it is the same.

105
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
Getting appointed by the source is
impossible because you said it the same as

106
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,361
what you study statistics and probably
can feel that if you have one member in a

107
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,300
continuous scale. What is the
problem of hitting this number?

108
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,660
Zero because that's what the
point it has local service center.

109
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,460
If you smoke you cannot get it.

110
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,193
Okay,

111
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,970
so they sent the reason
off your [inaudible] fine

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,460
not.
We could also sound our findings,

113
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,500
Internet meme style if you will.

114
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,810
So if you would like to
compute or facing that source,

115
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,710
we're not a technique that is
called next amount destination.

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,520
Then usually we'll
expect a wonderful image,

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,790
but this is what you're looking at.

118
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,300
Okay.

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,780
The first question is obviously
how will you work? Calendars

120
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,030
we give you is that every
time we add something,

121
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:10,770
some object and just be it the fuse
for anything but not light sources,

122
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,970
we can view the direct effect of
the light source on this point.

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,600
Okay,

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,560
so this is a schematic to show what is
going on. So I started from the viewer.

125
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,650
I hit this theater and I don't just
start placing the luminary outwards,

126
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,000
but I will connect this point to the
light source and I compute the director

127
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:32,834
limitation.

128
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,800
This is the schematic for PAF facing
without the next event estimation and this

129
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,930
is with next event estimations sweat.

130
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,660
Every station I connect
to the light source.

131
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,210
In this case this is actually a polluted
in this case this is the biddable and

132
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:55,140
then the third bounce you will get some
contributions from the light source.

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,460
The question is how do we do this exactly?

134
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,210
Well this is the topic is what's
the talking about the silence.

135
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,690
The formula that you see
in the assignments you is
exactly the very same thing.

136
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,423
Okay.

137
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,630
What wasn't there? Well, what
were you going interested in is

138
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,420
there was the term with the four or
five because if you have a light source

139
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:28,681
that's a sphere than what you would then
be or interested in how much we answers

140
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:33,861
admitted in one direction so then you
will need to divide by the area of the

141
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:39,631
surface which is a division by four pipe
and there's going to be the attenuation

142
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,290
through which is all squared.

143
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,200
Same as in the gravitational law or
even law electric fields. It needs that.

144
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,300
The first and a way I am from the
lights or the last month is going to,

145
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,820
this is the really good technique because
of multiple reasons and one of the

146
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:05,821
reasons is that you will get contributions
every mouse to the building to life.

147
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,120
Before I proceed,
I would like to tell you that here is,

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
we are talking about this and you shutter
and we are adding this parts of this

149
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,900
admission in every boss.

150
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,640
So if I hit p one I had the something if
I need to be too. I had this something.

151
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:31,020
If I eat wheat and I also add something,
but when I hit the light source,

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,310
I don't have the initial term anymore
because I will be at me get hooked yet.

153
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,230
So this one attribute that you would
add when you get the light source,

154
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,590
by chance, this is distributed
into an individual policy.

155
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,990
Why is this great?

156
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,010
We kind of have a point light sources
because the direct effect you can actually

157
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:54,450
measure, but you cannot hit the
light sources. So that's great tool.

158
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,700
We'll have less parents because it's not
like I either eat the light source for,

159
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,600
I don't.

160
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,100
I statistically always would be the
light source unless there are computers.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I'm handling many samples with small
variances and that's what's happened.

162
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,820
And monitoring because you either
win or you don't get anything.

163
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,390
So I can lower the variance,

164
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,180
which means that my images
will convert faster.

165
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,100
And the other thing is that because
there are contributions of every bounce,

166
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,850
I can separate director the
direction of the nation.

167
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,590
So a lot of people do this
in that industry because

168
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,820
the movie industry is nowadays
using outbreaks in there.

169
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,410
Can I see that as a ball and
Karposi something statement.

170
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,970
But for instance,

171
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:52,600
Disney Disney's mouth and using it in
the nation and what he did death most

172
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,460
mostly politics. Why?
Because it looks insane.

173
00:11:56,461 --> 00:12:01,461
The good and it is very simple and took
that more than 20 years for them to

174
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:07,050
replace their old system,
which they really liked it school base.

175
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,810
Okay.

176
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,320
And that, that'll be our musical freedom
office anytime they have a long time.

177
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,970
But the benefits of global illumination,
our mouth to the professor

178
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,010
and what they aren't doing is that
they get the physical invasions result.

179
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,280
But this is that always what the artists
are looking for is if you have worked

180
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,430
together with artists.

181
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,010
Okay,

182
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,800
the name of safe. Okay. You have
to do to the beautiful image.

183
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,800
But I would like the showers
together bit brighter.

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,150
Okay.

185
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,890
Do you view as the engineer say that
this is not possible and you didn't,

186
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,320
what will happen in physical
reality and that's it.

187
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,610
But the artists are interested
in physical reality.

188
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,340
They are interested in their own thoughts
and they're all not just the condition.

189
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,530
And he would make a change the shadows.

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,400
So you could in fact be really make one
off the light sources there and that the

191
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:00,604
shadows would get,

192
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,060
but that the audience has pain but
don't change anything else in the see,

193
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,290
just take the shadows and then you
could pull out their knowledge of the

194
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,520
relevant information that look the
radiance coming out from this point,

195
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,350
it cancel the surroundings so you cannot
just need something brighter and the

196
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:22,350
nearby things, we'll also get fried there.
You cannot circumvent why do you can't,

197
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,320
what you can do with the Max amount,
because condition is that you tick,

198
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,710
you generate an image from the first box,

199
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,070
so you will get one image which is
which you deposit the radiance that you

200
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:39,670
measured in Piedmont. That's something.
And then you pay for that matter we need,

201
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,660
which will only contain
the second pharmacists,

202
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,520
[inaudible] and poppers.

203
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:49,170
So you would have multiple images and
you could then I'm going to just add up.

204
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,360
All of these images would symbolization
that you want to get a physical reality.

205
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,500
Great,

206
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,970
but if the artist says that I was
stronger and directed in the nation,

207
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,800
then you would have this bathroom is the
image that holds up the second and the

208
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,270
higher order advances and you could do
some photos off or you can do whatever

209
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,430
you want with that without
touching anything else.

210
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,930
So you have a nice separation for
direct and indirect elimination,

211
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,110
moving industry, sorry, movie industry.

212
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,160
They are all the time and in the later
you will see some algorithms that became

213
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:28,990
differently on the indirect elimination
and differently on direct examination.

214
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,010
You can only do that if
you separate these firms.

215
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,810
So let's see, part facing now
with Max demand destination,

216
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,860
I have the very first bounce
and before I continue my way,

217
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,580
I will send the classical super,

218
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:48,850
super classical show rate.
So the light source,

219
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,120
a randomly chosen point of the light
and I wouldn't have this direct

220
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:57,140
contribution of delights source to
this point. And then I come to you,

221
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,620
let's go back to the time. Sorry. We
used managers for the very same thing.

222
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,220
This is why I'm writing all of these
terms because if you at the forums,

223
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:11,810
if you read papers, you will see these
terms and they all mean the same.

224
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,810
So exquisite light,
something Max demand customization I say,

225
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,670
so I continue my rate and I also hit the
light source would just chat away and

226
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:29,141
then I continue on and on and imagine
that this third one is an odd way that

227
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,080
actually it's the light
source and you find the mood.

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,910
I don't add the healthy part because
I did in the previous policy.

229
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,183
It's very important.

230
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,240
Now you have seen the
results or one five source,

231
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,070
nothing versus something.
That's what you have to.

232
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,160
But even if you have a reasonably
big light source, the light light,

233
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,593
light sauce,

234
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,610
I old you that you'd have various
suppression effect as well.

235
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,270
So this is sign off on something for,
because I think it's two,

236
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,880
maybe three cycles per pixel.

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,600
So this means that I grew up walking
soul and my do we race so we won't be far

238
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,913
also?

239
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,613
No,

240
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,881
this,

241
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:21,750
you can do it two different ways because
if you start to use vendors that we

242
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,860
will see how this exactly happens.

243
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,280
San renderers are entering the piles.

244
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,200
So what they do is that they start with
something source and if you say I want

245
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,660
Zappos per, then we'll start off,
take one more floor or whatever.

246
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,820
Not all the threats you
have on the other sheet.

247
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,730
If we take 47 four weeks old and it was
shooting more and more Saturday school

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,100
and after you've got to
long house on samples,

249
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,190
it was stop and show you.
It would be good input version

250
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,660
and what we fall progressive
rather Amy's the opposite.

251
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,250
You pick one thing so you should to
refuel it but only one and then you go to

252
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,080
the next and then you go to the them

253
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,900
and then see you in an image that
has a lot of noise and progressing

254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,240
progressively. You look at
lesson, this is what you see here.

255
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,280
It's progressing rather
no,

256
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,800
no one asked him at destination.

257
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:26,100
So we only got contributions if
we hit this light source in here.

258
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,570
So we look at the blood
sample now closely.

259
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:34,920
This is with last demand destination.
So there's a huge difference.

260
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,530
Such a symbol that he,
yes,

261
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,940
magazines with orders of. Great. Awesome.

262
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,010
Okay.

263
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,130
You can also play with this program, by
the way. He says he did sheet, right?

264
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,430
So when you read this at home,
just [inaudible] wait a minute.

265
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,800
It's amazing, dude. Fuck.
