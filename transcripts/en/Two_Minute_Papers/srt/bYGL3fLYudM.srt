1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,963
Okay.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,150
Okay,
so the very last assignment,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,750
please go to this unofficial
lux renders seen repository.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,370
There's also a link below it that shows
you how the individual scenes looked

5
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:11,800
like.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Please choose a scene and render it with
an unbiased method several times and

7
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,150
merge the results together.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,770
I hope that you remember from the previous
lecture how you can merge together

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,660
individual runs of unbiased algorithms
and hopefully get something better than

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,330
the individual images.
Do it with other algorithms,

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,790
both biased and unbiased algorithms.

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,260
I've also uploaded a settings file to
help you with these different algorithms

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,280
and see what happens.
I don't want to spoil the fun Pat.

14
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:46,780
Obviously we expect a given class of
algorithms to perform well in this regard

15
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,120
and some of them not so much.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,110
Also tried to experiment with
photo mapping type Algorithms.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,070
Place your observations in
the observations dot txt file.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,800
Tell me what kind of
algorithm worked where,

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,720
what are the failure cases and why and
is this what you have expected or did you

20
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,710
get something different?

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,370
Remember when we were doing
mathematics in the very first lectures,

22
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:14,371
we first always listed our expectations
and then after we got the results we

23
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:18,970
discussed whether reality was in
line with our expectations or not.

24
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:22,600
This is a really good methodologies,
so please do it all the time.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,670
There will be a rendering competition
afterwards where a really prestigious

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,260
international committee will judge your
work and there are lots of valuable

27
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,070
prizes.

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,070
We will get three tickets to the next
year's see EGC conference and peak sal

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,970
Vienna. So that's a total of six
free conference tickets for you.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,980
I'm also holding a talk at the CJC so I
would be more than excited to meet you

31
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:48,814
there.

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,610
So the CGC is the central
European Games conference.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,540
This is big Selfie Cellfina.
Their flier from last year.

34
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,200
So after you handed in your work, you
may be getting one of the three prizes.

35
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:07,970
The third prize is plus half of a grade
on the exam and this provided that you

36
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,920
would already pass the course.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,580
The second prize is plus
one grade on the exam.

38
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:18,260
And the first prize is perhaps
this is the official description,

39
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:21,920
perhaps an even greater
influence on the exam grade.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,290
If you don't really have artistic veins
or you would like to do some programming

41
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:31,640
assignment instead of deluxe renders
seem contest, you're free to do that.

42
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,870
Please contact me.

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Let's cook up a realistic and exciting
problem for you that you can solve.

44
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,870
So don't just start pounding away at
your keyboard and doing something.

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,140
Please write to me so we can discuss
what you're exactly going to do.

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,640
And if you do that, you are going to be
subject to the very same price. Okay,

47
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,220
so what about the rendering contest?

48
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:55,560
A contest theme this year
is going to be fluids.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,040
It's great because we have
a great fluid simulator in,

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,060
you have to create a scene and
handling converged images, not noisy,

51
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,280
converged images of the scene.
Okay,

52
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,620
so what is the list of things
that you need to hand in?

53
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,700
We would like to get the Lux renders
scene. Please copy every asset,

54
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,570
every texture, every Mesh, everything
that you have in the scene.

55
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,610
In this Lux render seen directory
that you give to us so we can run it

56
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,140
ourselves. We need also, like I said,
a completely noise free rendered image.

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,950
We would also need the blend file or
if you're using a different model or

58
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,130
program you are absolutely free
to use that. Please be my guest.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Just please send us the project file and
also send us one text file with a few

60
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:43,780
lines on what you try to accomplish
and why you think that your work is the

61
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,690
greatest work ever created by humanity.

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,280
Third Party sources for mashes are
fine but you have to give credit to the

63
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,650
people who created it.
Important.

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
We also ask for a halfway progress report.
What does it mean?

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,280
There will be a final deadline for the
assignment and halfway through death

66
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,230
there will be another deadline where I
expect you to send me an email with the

67
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,840
very same subject as
the assignment itself.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,230
You send me one rendered
image which is just a rough,

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,560
really rough draft of
what you are going to do.

70
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,050
So I'd like to see your current progress
and at least one line of text with your

71
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,530
plans.

72
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you exactly trying to accomplish
this we do because we would like to

73
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:33,001
discourage people from trying to put
together some seen in the last two days of

74
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,990
the assignment and not have enough time
to render it correctly or to develop it

75
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,824
correctly.

76
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,480
You would just like to make sure that
you are on time and please check the

77
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:48,220
course website to see what exactly
are the deadlines for this. Okay,

78
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,970
so who will be on the committee?
First, John Phillip Commodity.

79
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,150
He is the head developer of flex render,
the kindest,

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,950
kindest person who has been on this
committee for the third year now and he's

81
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,980
always very excited to
see your work Voita chaos.

82
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,840
You hopefully remember
the name from before.

83
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,550
He's the head of the rendering group
of these new research Surrey and an

84
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,080
excellent,
a truly excellent researcher.

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,190
[inaudible] our beloved professor who is
the head of the rendering group at our

86
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:19,780
university.
What about the programming guys?

87
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,800
If you don't want to participate in
the rendering contest, that's fine.

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,580
That's perfectly fine. There's two
different things that you can do. One,

89
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,120
do something with lux render.
We have, for instance,

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,980
a bank tracker where people are asking
for features and people are also asking

91
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,770
for bucks to be fixed.
So if you're interested in this,

92
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,160
then please take a look and if you
come it something that is useful,

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,470
then you will be subject to a first prize.

94
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,920
Now note that the first price
can be won by multiple people.

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,760
If you cross a given threshold
with the quality of your work,

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,470
then you will be subjected to the first
prize and there may be many of you who

97
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:01,471
do and also the small paint line where
you can improve small pain by practically

98
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,890
anything you can add by
direction of the past.

99
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,780
Tracing multiple important
sampling, fought on mapping,
whatever you have in mind,

100
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,050
but before you decide on anything,
contact me.

101
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,940
Last year's theme was volumetric caustics.

102
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,310
I think that's an amazing theme,

103
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,610
but this year this is not what
we are going to be interested in.

104
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,400
What we are going to be interested
in is fluid simulations.

105
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,380
This scene was created in blender.

106
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,640
So you can do sophisticated simulations
like this and even much more

107
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,930
sophisticated than this.

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,560
I have prepared some blander fluid
simulation tutorials for you.

109
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,550
So please take a look

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,560
and please make sure that your simulation
is the very least 300 cube and also an

111
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,210
example video to set the tone.

112
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:52,080
This is taken from the real
flow reel from last year.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
It is absolutely amazing.

114
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,540
Make sure to take a look and the subject
of the email that we're looking for is

115
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,510
the very same. You only need to
increment a number of the assignment

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,000
and that's it.
It's been a wonderful journey for me.

117
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,470
So thanks for tuning in.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I was trying my very best to teach you
the intricacies of light transport and I

119
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,900
hope that now you indeed
see the world differently.

120
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,700
I got some student feedbacks from many
of you and I got the kindest of words,

121
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,080
so thank you very much.

122
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,410
I'm really grateful and if you're
watching this through the Internet,

123
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:31,530
then we have a comment section.
Let us know if you like the course.

124
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,850
So thank you very much.

125
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,660
And despite the fact that it
seems that the course ends here,

126
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,230
we have a lecturer from before
that we haven't published yet.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,100
There'll be some more videos with
Hamas who teaches you how to compute

128
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:47,340
subsurface scattering. So one
more time. Thank you very much,

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,570
and it's been a wonderful journey.
Thanks. I'll see you later.
