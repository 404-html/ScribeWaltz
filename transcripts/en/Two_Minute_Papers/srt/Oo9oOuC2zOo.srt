1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,123
Next time.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,970
What you will see is something that
was missing from many of the big goal

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,800
orientations of many
assignments. What, what is it?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,860
What is the complexity of
the ray tracing algorithm?

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,710
Depending on what it depends on the
resolution, the bigger the English,

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,060
the longer it takes.
Got It.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,530
It is exponential with respect to the
death at least this implementation is if

8
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:27,930
you, if you should have to raise,
there is always a branching. Damn,

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,070
this is going to be exponential, so we
have taken into consideration resolution.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,130
We have taken into consideration
depth but we haven't taken,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,200
taken into consideration how many
objects there are in the scene and if you

12
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:47,271
start running the same ray tracer on
huge thing because you don't want to see

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,500
spheres, you won't want to do
ray tracing like real men do,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,780
then what you do is you implement
a function that can load.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,270
You try,

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,100
we'll measures and then you just grab
a Nice Triangle Mesh and I seen from

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,120
somewhere loaded to your ray tracer and
you very excitedly the ray tracer and

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,070
you don't get anything
in your whole lifetime.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,780
If you lose something with millions of
and which voltages, not much nowadays. Why

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,690
someone else. Yeah, so
fixed. Wrong. That's true.

21
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:22,760
But why does it take too long?

22
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:27,450
Because you have to do a lot of
intersections lists. Exactly. So I have,

23
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,980
if I have 1 million objects,

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,660
I have to do one minute intersections
every single time. That's too much.

25
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,800
That's just way too much.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,110
So what we can do is that we can
do some kind of space partitioning,

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,630
which means that simple
optimizations I can do,

28
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,290
for instance,

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,700
I really don't care what is behind me
because I'm going to intersect something

30
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:54,780
that's in front of me. So whatever is
behind me, I can immediately throw this,

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,050
all of those polygons out,
that's immediately half of it.

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,210
And if you use smart
tricks and Katie trees,

33
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,250
smart tricks,
smart data structures,

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,630
you can go from linear while
in the air one way or objects,

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,450
one minute intersections.
So that's linear complexity.

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,240
You can go to local rhythmic complexity,

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,880
which is amazing because
the logarithm after a point,

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,590
it doesn't really increase too much.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,160
And you will learn about techniques
that will make you able to compute this

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,150
intersection with like 1 million objects,

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,170
with about four or five
intersections of leverage.

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,950
Obviously obviously it depends on the
distribution of the triangles and all of

43
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:45,060
that, but on average you can do it in
four or five intersection instead of one

44
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,090
Lillian, so it's a huge shoot. Speed up.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,190
This is going to be out the next spectrum,

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,950
and again it seems that I have been
lying to you all along regarding this as

47
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:01,951
well because I told you that
are measuring radiants for uh,

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,720
than the equation.

49
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,860
Now radiants I cannot really display on
my monitor or what can I display in my

50
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,570
minor RGB values.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,640
So there has to be some transformation
that comes from radios and converted to

52
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,650
RGB in a meaningful way.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,030
This process is called and told that
big and Thomas is going to tell you all

54
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:25,510
about that thing as well. You can
do it in a number of different ways.

55
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,280
It's happening on the trivial
and the good tone back. They,

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,130
it really breathes life
into your rendered images.

57
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,220
Yeah.

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,380
Now we haven't talked about filtering.

59
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,410
This is a bit more sophisticated recursive
ray tracing you show you should one

60
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:46,680
sample through the mid point of the big
source of leucine. You computed this,

61
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,380
you're done with Monte-carlo integration.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,240
We are going to have many samples so we
are going to have a metric that's called

63
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:59,241
samples for big soul and these samples
will not go through the mid point of the

64
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:01,284
Pixel.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,320
These are going to go through the surface
of the pixel like random samples over

66
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,980
the surface of the pixel and we are
going to integrate the valiums over the

67
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:11,814
whole surface.

68
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,520
Now you can do this differently because
you have many samples over the pixel

69
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:21,840
surface and you can take into
consideration them into consideration the

70
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,170
different ways and you can see
that different filtering method.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,560
This is what we call filtering and
different filtering methods will give you

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,590
different results and the interesting
part is that you will get anti aliasing

73
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:39,981
for free if you do filtering well because
in a ray tracer you will shoot one

74
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,080
race through the mid point of the Pixel.
Your images,

75
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,230
unless they are super high resolution,
they are going to be areas.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,250
The completely straight line
is going to be pixelated.

77
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,120
The edges are going to be pixilated.
What can you do?

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,130
Feel things like super sampling.

79
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Let's split one pixel into 400 pixels
for smaller pixels and compute the race

80
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,050
through all of them and leverage.

81
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,120
That's the Vivian method that gives
you anti-aliasing by supercenter,

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,400
but this is super expensive.

83
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,550
I mean you have HD resolutions and you
have to bump this up by even four times

84
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,290
too much. There's better solutions.
You can get this for free.

85
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,440
You global elimination
if you do feel different,

86
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,650
so this is what filtering is about.
Domestic is also going to talk,

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,940
this is not one retro is the next
three lectures it's going to talk about

88
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:38,230
participate in media.
What is this about? Well,

89
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,620
in our simulations so far we have taken
into consideration that race of flight

90
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,180
only bounce off of surfaces, but in
real life there's not only surfaces,

91
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,670
there's volumes that smoke haze.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,010
Many of these effects where array of light
can not really hit an object but just

93
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,760
small and get scattered.

94
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,990
And if you do your simulation in a way
that it supports such participate in

95
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,650
medium,
then you can get volume costs

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,360
and that's amazing because I just have
shown you the ring and whatever else kind

97
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:18,420
of costings and we'll look at,

98
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,780
you will think of those as as some two
d things that I see it on the table,

99
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,240
this diffuse material that that
diffuses this rate inspect to me.

100
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,410
So you would think that sticks and
shadows are playing are they are two deep

101
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,530
things but they are in fact volumes.

102
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,950
So the shallows exist not only
the plane but they have the volume

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,290
because the,

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,900
the set of points that are extracted from
the light source or not on the plane,

105
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,110
they are in three d.

106
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,180
Yeah

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,780
and you can get volumetric castex and
volume shuttles with participating in

108
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,950
media media because
there will be immediate,

109
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,180
immediate in terror of
which light can scatter.

110
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,490
So therefore you will
see these boundaries.

111
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,470
You can also get God rays.
Beautiful,

112
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,400
phenomenal in curriculum in that nature.

113
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,410
If you compute participating,

114
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,353
okay.

115
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,070
You can also get something like this.

116
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:33,071
This is an actual photograph just to make
sure that you see the difference that

117
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,543
the,

118
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,180
the first raid is traversing the air
or vacuum and the next ones haven't

119
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:44,990
participated in Edo which can give you
discipline, this scattering effect.

120
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,430
And another example of God rays while
apparently we have this do not disturb.

121
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,783
Okay

122
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,990
piece of paper. So there is some lacks
render and then going on in this room,

123
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:03,200
you better not enter who
knows what you will see

124
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,590
and you can get,
not necessarily suck pronounced effects,

125
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,220
but the more subtle effect that you can,
you can feel that there is some,

126
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:16,430
he's in this image but it's,
it's not super.

127
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,043
Yeah.

128
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,810
Now we don't stop there because

129
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,880
don't just think of of
smoke and atmosphere.

130
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,070
You can just look at your own skin if
you would like to see some participating

131
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,943
helium.

132
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,160
Now this is a phenomenon he called
subsurface scattering and this means that

133
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,910
some of the things that you
would think our objects are, uh,

134
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,380
surfaces are in fact volumes.
This is your skin. For instance,

135
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,380
light goes through your
skin portion of light.

136
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,700
And we don't simulate that because
when we hit the surface of the object,

137
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,090
we though you bet.

138
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,580
And if we write this innovation that
makes us evil to go inside of these

139
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,784
objects,

140
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,350
then we have a simulation with subsurface
scattering and we kind of come from

141
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,630
beautiful,
beautiful effects like this.

142
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,430
These are some simulations.
So for instance,

143
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,610
on the left side you can see probably
in the marble there's subsurface

144
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:22,720
scattering in marbles.

145
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,200
It seems heavily exaggerated to
me or either there is a really,

146
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:30,010
really strong that lighting,
but this is not a surface anymore.

147
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,990
You can see the nose of the lady light.

148
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,700
Lots of softer radiants
actually gets the food to those.

149
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,680
This is one more example.
This is not so pronounced and this is,

150
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,890
this is not so exaggerated,
but you can see this.

151
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:50,891
J Dragon clearly has some subsurface
scattering who kept the home tickling same

152
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,180
parts like the end of the tail.

153
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,080
You can see that it's much lighter and
this is because some of the light is

154
00:09:57,081 --> 00:10:02,081
going through it and the
optical [inaudible] thick
parts like the body of the

155
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,630
dragon have less subsurface scattering.
So you can see that this is a bit darker.

156
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,690
It's a beautiful phenomenon.
And we can also see lead this.

157
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,560
I look at,
look at this one.

158
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,290
Absolutely amazing that
doesn't this look amazing.

159
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,280
This is incredibly awesome.

160
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:26,040
We can ride computer programs that
can compute this reasonable amount.

161
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,210
So absolutely beautiful phenomenon.
I still kept this as well.

162
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,190
This is a fractal. It's subsurface
scattering. I mean, how,

163
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,970
how cool can someone get it's
fractals and subsurface galleries.

164
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:44,060
It's like two of the best
foods mixed together. It's is,

165
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,510
it has to be something else.

166
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,790
And another example of
a beautiful jade dragon

167
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,600
with just a bit of subsurface scattering.

168
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,313
Yeah.

169
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,380
So that's going to be it for today
and there's going to be the next three

170
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:11,450
lectures with us.

171
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,070
These are all the exciting things that
are going to be discussed and that we

172
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,770
will complete the Monte Carlo integration.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,010
I will tell you how I lied to you exactly.

174
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,380
And how do you use mathematics to see
from these lies and that maybe the right,

175
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
our global illumination program.
Thank you.
