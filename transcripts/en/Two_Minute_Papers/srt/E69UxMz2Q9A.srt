1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
So, um, as I said before, the tone my,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,600
but we will look at what's developed
and how the wall in Etsy graph 2002

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,870
presented. So it's all, it has,

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,730
it had already some time to prove
itself, so to say. Um, it's widely used,

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:22,731
so most a light simulation brotox
and also HDR photography tools,

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,070
you have it and it has both
a global and a local variant.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,840
So they were both present
here.

8
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,810
You'll see the difference between a
global and the local approach. Yeah,

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,473
you can come.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,760
Um, yes, in some way.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
I mean I'm usually
convolutions by fixed Carmel.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,430
So your kernel function
is the same. Um, here,

13
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,070
this could be a nonlinear car.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,880
So it's not that it's linear convolution
in the sense that you have one fixed

15
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,270
cargo,
the toss it,

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,070
but you have a non linear
mapping in this sense.

17
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,740
It's not really convolution,

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,720
but the implementations can are in spirit.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,780
So if you want to have it fast,
it's apparent elation,

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,670
parallelization strategies that work
for convolutions of the work for them.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,433
Yeah.

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,760
Um,
usually you,

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,180
I will go into the local approach later,

24
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,260
but you usually have to
attempt the feature size.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,500
So I don't you do multiple passes with
different discretization of your calls

26
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:48,810
size or you taking a huge call
and very different function. So,

27
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,580
okay,

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,090
okay. Here the difference between a
global and the local approach. Um,

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm not hundred percent sure how vital
this is perceivable this bro check door

30
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,320
for example.
You see that the local approach,

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,520
it's much more contrast in the
coop my path or for example,

32
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:15,260
in the, um, in the
mosaics on the judgment.

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,820
I think an older one
already works very well,

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,470
is faster,

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,040
but it doesn't give you all the
possibilities that your I would give you.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,230
So the steps,
these are just a short outline.

37
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:38,700
I will explain what this meant
with this formula does of course,

38
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,810
if we want to have in
depth details on this, um,

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,090
the references at the end of the lecture.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,760
So I'm here,
I present the global version.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So you will now have one mapping
function off the whole image or of the

42
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,470
luminance values of the whole image to Eh,
um,

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,500
color space.

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,100
So the first thing you do is you compute
some kind of average of the image.

45
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,280
So since you do not know if this is,

46
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:16,020
is this inherently a very
dark image or is it um,

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,920
globally a very bright image,

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,340
you somehow have to set
the baseline so to say,

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,020
and this is done with the log average,

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,850
so you don't just ever age the,
um,

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,330
the sun, so you don't sum up in
divide because this would give,

52
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,343
um,

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
unproportional weight to the large
values because they are some help

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,150
exponentially distribute that. You can
imagine. So this takes care of that.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,890
So you're um,

56
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,203
okay,

57
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,390
you ever h in log space and 10
convert back into explanation.

58
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,800
Okay.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,980
And then you have some kind
of average of your scene.

60
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,250
So this is the approximate
average brightness of the
image that I'm looking at.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,940
And then you met this
to a middle gray value.

62
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,400
So a is now what,

63
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:21,260
what do you define as you want to
have middle gray. This you can vary.

64
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,670
This also depends on what the
ranges you have available.

65
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,230
And this now sets the bar so everything
above this medical grade will be

66
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:37,820
brighter, everything below
would be darker. And then

67
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,183
um,

68
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,260
what you do is you take the
middle grade value and um,

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,560
skate sampled accordingly to it.

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,740
So now you don't have a input in some
kind of arbitrary range but you have it

71
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,100
relative to the middle
grade where you and Ben,

72
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:03,860
what you do is that your compress
the high Luminance's. So as, um,

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,860
if you're a member from before our
distribution division by a maximum,

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,550
which gave you just a single
bright spot in the image,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,720
this is because the high
lumen answers dominate,

76
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,660
usually dominate the scene but are only,

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,400
have very small extent in the senior
sales imagined looking at the sun.

78
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,550
I mean the son is very small when
compared to the whole skydome but it would

79
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,570
dominate it as immensely
higher uprightness values
than the surrounding blue of

80
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:43,110
the sky. So what you do here
is not that you are men,

81
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,770
you're escaped nominates values to the
final output by compressing the higher

82
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,520
Luminance's.

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,960
So in the lower right
you see the function,

84
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,960
the mapping function.
So, um, as you see that,

85
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,883
Eh,

86
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,890
a huge range save from Daniel four to
10 in the x axis is mapped to a rather

87
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,710
small part in the y axis.
That means that um,

88
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,570
a lot of uh, large Luminance's
are just compressed in a small,

89
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,400
um,
range in a say RGB values.

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,210
And what you also have is
that the small luminance,

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,760
so to the small Lumina answers in
the input file or in the input image,

92
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,740
um, are mapped to a larger
extent. On the y axis.

93
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,640
This,

94
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,640
you can see that there are slow of the
faction starts out as nearly vertical

95
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:49,384
Lee.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,393
Okay,

97
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,160
go at a 45 degree,

98
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,580
you will have a one one mapping
which is approximately a two.

99
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,020
And then you have a compression.
So well what this mapping to us it,

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,850
it compresses the high lumen answers
and enhances the low Luminance's.

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
And this thank to the mapping
and you can convert this into,

102
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,560
so I go back.
So the output lumen answers,

103
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,590
then half are in a predefined range from
zero to one and can then be mapped to

104
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:25,790
whatever color space you like.

105
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,230
Okay,

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,760
so the local version, this is now the one
that takes the neighbors into account,

107
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,320
starts off similarly.

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,560
So your computer log ever ridge to get
an estimate is the average brightness of

109
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:44,180
my scene. Then you're met
the values to average gray.

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,280
That means that the value
of one is now my, uh,

111
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,240
the middle of gray to the defined.

112
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,620
But now I do not compress the luminance
by one uniform function over the whole

113
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:05,300
image, but then locally at depth this
function by looking at the neighbors.

114
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,340
So now, um, this,

115
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,330
um, the local average, um,

116
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,850
upper case B now depends

117
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,870
not only on the coordinates in the image,
so x and y.

118
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,750
So the Pixel that I'm there right now,

119
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,950
but it also depends on some kind of scale.

120
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
The scale means how uniform and
my brightness distributions there.

121
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,970
So we are,

122
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:42,971
I am I at a say a silhouette
where half of it is very dark,

123
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:49,061
half of it is very bright or min a
homogeneous region because in homogeneous

124
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:54,570
regions I would adapt,
uh,

125
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,590
on the extent on the rate
dinner to this brightness.

126
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,750
And if it's accommodated
to this brightness, it can
differentiate details better.

127
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,180
Um, you perhaps have already experienced
that when you look at the moon.

128
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,830
So if you look quickly at the moon,
it's just a bright spot,

129
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,900
but the longer you look at it,
the more details you can discern.

130
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,730
This is an adaptation of your iTunes.

131
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,250
And this happens also at a
local sports of the retina.

132
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,840
And this is what seem related here.

133
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,890
So you compute for every pixel position x,
y,

134
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,660
and locals came.

135
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,600
Yeah.

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,290
And with this local scale your time,
um,

137
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:46,210
you compute the local average v and
this now gives you how much range

138
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:50,240
compression is going to
happen at this location.

139
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,330
Okay.

140
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,210
So, um, so how to get this came.

141
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,220
So this case is, um, the extent

142
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,550
of an area around to speak for whether
brightness doesn't change too much.

143
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,090
So in this example where
you have a colorful, um,

144
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,540
church window does,
is that is illuminated from outside.

145
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,680
You have three different
examples on how your,

146
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,500
um, Ken puts the influence
re regional for your scheme.

147
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,140
So that land,

148
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,170
how tall [inaudible] asked this
by computing to [inaudible]
and then look at the

149
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,720
[inaudible],
um,

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,090
[inaudible] them in a way that
they have a certain behavior.

151
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,570
So in the very top you'll see your assume
that the pixel is in the center of the

152
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,910
two concentric circles.

153
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,100
So this is the biggest goal
that I want to talk about now.

154
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,280
And if I lie,

155
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,760
if I bought two concentric
small circles around it,

156
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,440
then I see that, um, that the center area,

157
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,150
the smaller circle is quite smooth
in the distribution of brightnesses.

158
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,750
But the Alto Circle,
it's very smooth too.

159
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,840
So there is no significant difference
between the small and the large circle.

160
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,000
That means that my scale is too small.

161
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,190
That means that I could enlarge
my circle even more. And stealing,

162
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,400
um,
retains smoothness.

163
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,320
In the center example,

164
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,880
you see the correct
application so that the center,

165
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,610
this has smooth values.

166
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,760
So they are approximately
the same brightness.

167
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,350
But if you take now the outer
circle that intersects the window,

168
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,010
you see that suddenly in this footprint,

169
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,980
very large values are.

170
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,550
So you'll see that the
small circle is smooth,

171
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,130
but the surrounding area is not smooth.

172
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,680
And this is what you want to achieve
when you determined the local skate.

173
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,590
So the larger the local scale is the,

174
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,760
the more, um, you are looking
at the large patch of equal,

175
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,300
um, brightnesses and your,
I would adapt to that.

176
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,050
That means that for this pixel you can
improve the contrast because I will do

177
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:28,210
the same. Um, and other failure case,

178
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:32,020
what you should not do is that you
make the piece too large as the,

179
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,400
as shown in the bottom example because
your bright values already in the

180
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,253
northeast.

181
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,300
Okay?

182
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,280
So this scale,
it would be too large.

183
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,040
Okay.

184
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,060
Um, I go back. So what you get, but this,

185
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,190
when you notice k,
you know,

186
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,703
yeah,

187
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,150
how large the region is, where you
can compute your local area average.

188
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,250
And this then allows you to
locally compress your range.

189
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,280
So if it's very smooth,
you compress less.

190
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,720
If you're next to very bright boundaries,
you're,

191
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,570
so if you're there,

192
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,870
if you're next to these continuities
in the brightness and your image,

193
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,620
so they are,

194
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,620
you are at the verge of traversing from
bright to dim region or vice versa.

195
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,190
You go to the opposite.
Yeah.

196
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,770
The ratio between the larger radius.
Constance.

197
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,820
Exactly.
Yeah.

198
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,350
This is the approach that you take
there and then you have to find this,

199
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:43,120
I mean they are also show
you an implementation.

200
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:47,770
All this can be efficiently mapped because
I mean triangle all the possible, um,

201
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,030
circles is,

202
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,080
or this is not feasible so you need some
kind of approximation that gives you a

203
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,060
good estimate of that also is he goes
to the corner of the immune system.

204
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,340
Um, yeah. I mean, I mean I don't
know how they handled it is,

205
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:13,540
but I would guess that he just ignore
everything that's out of the image.

206
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,130
So you have to cope with your,
do you have there and,

207
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,800
but this is natural in
the corners of your image.

208
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,240
You get less neighborhood so you get
less information of all the surrounding

209
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:29,010
looks like. So you will get,
say less optimal tone maybe.

210
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,520
So I'm here, uh, another difference, uh,

211
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,950
assuming the image before.
So as you can see,

212
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,940
the angel fingers on the wall are much
higher contrast and this is now because

213
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,050
the brightness whale you
around or relatively,

214
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,400
so if you're calm prds with
say the window next to it,

215
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,840
then this has a very uniform brightness.

216
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,090
Even if the colors are perhaps different,

217
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,650
this is still a low range as you
saw before. Between sun and moon,

218
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,980
it was 800,000.
Between Black and white,

219
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,570
it was 100 or 1000. So, um,

220
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,700
if you have direct or
indirect illumination counts
much more than just color

221
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:27,160
variations of your surface.
So here, the Dole mapper,

222
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,000
correct, the deck clean, it's local verse.

223
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,010
She that the brightness values
are quite uniform in this region,

224
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,100
so it enhances the contrast.
So,

225
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,660
um, now this wall of this,
uh, concludes the Rialto met,

226
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,350
but there are also other,
um, told mapping approaches.

227
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:51,460
So in this,
um,

228
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,100
see graph 2002 was the year of the tone
may bus because there were three tone,

229
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,690
I think, uh, approaches presented. Um,

230
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,890
so one of those was a bilateral filter.

231
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,860
Perhaps you already heard of
Bellator filtering in, um,

232
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,490
computer vision perhaps.
Um, they are, this is,

233
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,640
you can imagine it as a Darshan
smoothing that does not move away ages.

234
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,360
So if you have a large
difference in your image,

235
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,340
then it does not smooth decently.
So this is,

236
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,880
you can also call it age
preserving smooth thing.

237
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,530
And um,

238
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,610
you can imagine that this is
somehow conception similar
to this skein estimation

239
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:46,391
of a handheld because the scale estimation
books where do the brightness values,

240
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,250
um,
define lot.

241
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,340
So these are saved my brightness ahs
in the image and then it doesn't try to

242
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,350
propagate contrast enhancement or what
his age and the bilateral fifth dose can

243
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:04,580
do the same thing because he just
stopped the filtering process at ages.

244
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,610
Then another approach by
photog great end processing,

245
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,660
um, this is, um,

246
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,840
you can imagine an image,

247
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,350
say you have only illuminates
channel of a single,

248
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:28,020
um, color. Then you can imagine
your image as a height Farfetch.

249
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,310
So bright spots,
um,

250
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
correspond to high peaks
team regions too low valleys.

251
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,200
And what they do in this work is
that the look at the gradients.

252
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,010
So Hall's deep are the slopes in my
image and then they compress ingredient

253
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,720
range does it allows them to um,

254
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
to per surf low gradients because these
are small slopes are the Arctic details

255
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:12,111
in the team layer illuminated regions
and the s and a very high slopes are

256
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,840
there. Um, Duran pops to the
bright spots. So if your chest,

257
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,520
um,
say reduce the high gradients,

258
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,310
you also get a similar
behavior that your own way, um,

259
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,350
reduce the range in non uniform regions.

260
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,450
So these are three approaches
that do approximately the same.

261
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:41,451
They have the same underlying idea but
they have different approaches to it.

262
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,500
So they're one of our Hanhardt
those more into what what's used in,

263
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,423
um,

264
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,130
in photography with their disease
exposure plates that you can use.

265
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Bilateral filtering immediately uses
are whale established filtering,

266
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,660
partaken in signal processing,

267
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,120
but it's most likely very suboptimal
from a perceptual point of view.

268
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,780
Um,

269
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,780
gradient processing allows a very fast
application but perceptionally of these

270
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:20,950
who works there and how to
make this the best and um,

271
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,140
this speed increases the
two perhaps needed, um,

272
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,200
13 years ago and not really relevant now.

273
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:33,201
So you don't need to take approximations
that we're highly relevant before into

274
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,810
account anymore and just do the and just
have something that's less efficient

275
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,260
but gives you a lot of the
box, nice solution. And uh,

276
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,580
we feel check we can be there.
Um,

277
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,950
the German version has along
the list, um, the least,

278
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,680
approximately 20 different variants.

279
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,920
Um,

280
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
the literature for debt is brand hut
not only started that but also continued

281
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,900
research and that, and he's a con, uh,

282
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,910
seen as one of the say experts that
to go to when to mapping is concerned.

283
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,080
He wrote a book about that.
So heightened emigre ng change.

284
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,290
Um,

285
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,060
and you can also see this three papers
if you want to know how to speak

286
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,300
developed, um, you just check for example,

287
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:34,980
there are and how to paper on
the Digital Library of ACM.

288
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,530
You can, uh, to lose from here, from
the university. So you get an a car,

289
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,910
you get immediate access to the whole
Digital Library of ACM and they are,

290
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,911
you can just click on site that buy and
then you get the long list of papers

291
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,760
that referenced the original work about
and hot and then you can sort them by a

292
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,280
years and look what different
approaches were used.

293
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,860
Good. That concludes the tone. I've
been parts. Are there any questions?

294
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,300
Okay. If not, oral

295
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,490
method is used cameos?

296
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,290
MMM,

297
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,700
to some extent.
MMM,

298
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,760
because I mean you're inherently
losing information because,

299
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,951
okay.

300
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:49,951
The sate of thing where you for sure lose
precision is if you have before say 24

301
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:56,410
Pete venues and then you're in
Colton in eight beat RGB values.

302
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,460
Then you have a conversation
of your brightness ratings.

303
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,310
This is unrecovered.
This is just lost.

304
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,690
The other thing is if you use
local approaches that take

305
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,890
that, take up the neighborhood information
to account and then through different

306
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:17,980
things in different regions of the image,

307
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,310
then it could be that you have some
kind of ambig curiosity if you want to

308
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,480
reverse this process because then
it could be that you're either had,

309
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,180
say in original data,

310
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,680
large brightness Barrios and as a,

311
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,690
at a small scale or a large range
compression then or the range was already

312
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:46,120
small like that and you'll just
use less compression. So you,

313
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,680
um,

314
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,680
you do not have the full information how
local approaches adapt to certain parts

315
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,720
of the image.

316
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,980
You will have to infer this somehow,

317
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,040
I would guess like a
customization approach.

318
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,740
So you've looked like that locally.

319
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:11,010
You should have the same skein that you
assume that you reconstruct and then you

320
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:16,740
can recover you're seeking,
but you will not be able to recover it

321
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,460
with global approach us. It
should be possible. Yeah.

322
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,730
Yeah.

323
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,680
Okay.
Yup.

324
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,940
Combined goal and the local
ones is the right one.

325
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,950
Tournament does any way equal
amounts within global one?

326
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
That's a local one. If you look here, um,

327
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,530
the local version has, uh,
please express she, so the,

328
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,250
um,

329
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
the scales normally names is then
divided by some kind of local average.

330
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,240
And the global version,
the first two steps are identical,

331
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,390
but then it uses the escaped venue all
way at the very center to say compute

332
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,300
this local average.

333
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,390
So the global version is a special case
of the local version that there is not a

334
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,720
certain waiting governmental if you,
uh,

335
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,640
no, no, no, no, no, uh, um,

336
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,630
that illuminates all support.
This is what you get.

337
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,030
So for each picture location,

338
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:32,810
you get a scale luminance
between zero and one,

339
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,250
but a global approach and by
the local approach. So here,

340
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,380
it also immediately gives you the
ultimate luminance so that there is no

341
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,290
combination then.

342
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,653
Okay.

343
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,130
The questions?

344
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,940
Yeah.

345
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,030
Okay. Dan, thank you for your attention.

346
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:57,720
And this concludes this [inaudible]

347
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,680
Aye.
