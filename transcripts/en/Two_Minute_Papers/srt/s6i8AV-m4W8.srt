1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,650
No to the second part,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,990
it's quite different.
So it's told mapping.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,590
This is concerned in our,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,610
so before we had a optimization
for the light simulation,

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,350
now we'll will look at the very
end of our rendering pipeline.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,470
So the issue of showing the
image output on a display

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,110
because the problem is that
alight simulation outputs
radiants so it's the how

8
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,701
much light travels along one direction
when it comes from a small surface page.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,520
So you collect radiance with your camera,

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,490
record it,

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,590
but somehow your display
expects RGB values.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,870
So the radiance can carry some
curling formation. So you could,

13
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,640
for example,
um,

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,140
trays the are the g the B value,
uh,

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,030
general independently.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,950
You can do something with more
fidelity like spectral ray tracing.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,990
So you trace rays that um,

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,400
were not only radiance is
carried along the rape,

19
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,100
but spectro radiance.

20
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:24,330
So gradients of a certain
wavelength of the light.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,550
This,
for example,

22
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,551
you can see this effect in prisons
where you split white light into rainbow

23
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,324
colors.

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,570
So if you do not perform spectral ray
tracing there and just assume we have

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,030
white radiant,

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,070
then you cannot simulate this effect
because the, then the reflection,

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,640
so the rage geometry changes with the
wavelength that's associated to it.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,500
So your refraction angles get different
and this causes the split into the

29
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,200
rainbow colors.
So,

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,360
but in some way you
have radiant as output.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,320
So to show them on this
place or to bring them,

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
you need to convert your images.

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Some are from Radians to RGP and there
is an inherent problem with it because

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,350
radiance of light simulation have a huge
range because they tried to simulate

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,190
real world physics.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,640
And in real world you have a huge
difference between dark and bright.

37
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,290
So for example, if you take, um,

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,390
the ratio between the surf
between a surface at say,

39
00:02:55,021 --> 00:03:00,021
ground level in the earth atmosphere
that is either illuminated by the sun or

40
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,390
the moon,
the differences effect of $800.

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,440
And then he mentioned that the patch
of the ground is either white or black.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
This courses and other different in
the reflected radiants quantities of

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,910
approximately a factor 100.
So if you want to do,

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,760
say,
a Chandler light simulation,

45
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
and you can expect that elimination
by Sun and moon should be in there,

46
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,250
white and black surfaces
should also be in there.

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,430
You have to somehow cold with a ratio
between the darkest and the brightest

48
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:44,230
values of 80 million.

49
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
MMM.

50
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,870
So is it relevant to do that?

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,220
So can people even see the
difference between that?

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,070
And yes, they can. So since
these are highly relevant,

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,013
um,

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,990
features of our world to differentiate
dark from bright especially and the very

55
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,800
bright and dark conditions,

56
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,250
so imagine a cave men
in the woods at night,

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,400
it will be very good to see small
contrast differences that could indicate

58
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:27,570
predators. So there
was a evolutionary, um,

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,130
forcing to develop,
to develop a visual system that,

60
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,203
um,

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,300
also can take advantage of this huge
dynamic range of radiants values.

62
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,980
So for example,
how this is built up.

63
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,850
So photoreceptors in our eyes,

64
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,910
they have a chemical bleaching when
they are hit by light particles.

65
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,670
So this can be regulated biochemical
to enable adaptation in a range of two

66
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,810
orders of magnitude.

67
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,870
So just by regulating the CPO
chemical properties of photoreceptors,

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,960
you can adapt the I to a rain.

69
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,020
The difference in dark and bright of 100
the pupil size gives you another order

70
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:19,531
of magnitude.

71
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:23,760
So a factor of 10 and the neural
adaptation is more or less the signal

72
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,511
processing.

73
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:29,511
So what to do actually with the changing
signal because your receptors get

74
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:34,650
bleached. So the dynamic range of human
vision is approximately 100 million.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,700
So that means that we can perceive in
fact the dynamic range of realistic

76
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:49,800
conditions on in our atmosphere.

77
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,763
But

78
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,010
then you have,
so the output of the light,

79
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,410
if it takes this into account can be,

80
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,540
it can have a difference of 80 million
fixed of 80 million between dark and

81
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,890
bright and 10 you want to
show this on the display.

82
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
So the technology for a standard display
gives you a dark too bright ratio of

83
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,961
approximately 1000 and if you use
eight feet in Kolding of your values,

84
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,790
then you only have 265
values for it beat chambers.

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,120
That means that somehow our technology
is immensely inadequate to show realistic

86
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:45,130
scenarios.
It's all great.

87
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:50,131
This is also good because you
get not blinded by your display,

88
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,540
but we have to somehow account for that.

89
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,110
So just taking the radiance output
and converting it trivially,

90
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:03,100
two images will carry
some problems with it.

91
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,933
Yeah,

92
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,520
usually big bitmaps files or [inaudible].

93
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,840
Um, but um, usually you'll have, um,

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,110
you split them into the different colors.

95
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,330
So you have eight weeks for our
eight weeks for g h big floppy.

96
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And you can somehow imagined that this
gives you how much red light is at this

97
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,250
pixel. And Yeah, you call 206. I mean,

98
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,240
of course for the whole color
gamut you have more venues.

99
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,150
But if you just look at the dark
brighter ratio of a single college,

100
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,920
this is approximately what you have.
So

101
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,730
now Tom mapping is the methods that
was developed to combat this problem.

102
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,600
So the output of a light
simulation as already said,

103
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,750
high dynamic range because of the of
real world dynamic range of brightness,

104
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:08,901
values and display devices
usually have a low dynamic range.

105
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,700
So what do we need to do is to
compress the range of alt book somehow.

106
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,170
And this is referred to as added
tone mapping, a tome reproduction.

107
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,770
So these are the names that
you find in the literature.

108
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,523
MMM,

109
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,680
there are two issues here.
One is range compression.

110
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,740
So how to convert high dynamic range
luminant's to load and they make range

111
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,144
luminance.

112
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,210
This is the content of this
lecture and then you still have um,

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,410
Luminance's,

114
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,880
but usually there are standardized
color spaces in which images are stored.

115
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,730
So you don't store your own,
um,

116
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,490
hold rooms format,

117
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,410
which takes certain
wavelength and thank yous,

118
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,370
the luminance values for those,

119
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,430
but they are standardized ways to do that.

120
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,380
And this is covered in a different
lecture about color. You'll see the,

121
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,510
um,
lecture number here.

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
So I refer you to this lecture if you
want to know more about color in here.

123
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,330
Now I only,
um,

124
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,550
explain range comparation to some extent.
So

125
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,443
okay,

126
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,660
now, uh, um, graphic example.

127
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,900
So here we have a bright as single bright
light source with no ambient light in

128
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,040
the scene. That means that all, um,

129
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,580
contrast comes only from this one
light source via global illumination.

130
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,100
Okay.

131
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,480
So if you take,

132
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,660
if you would photograph the
scene and take a short exposure,

133
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,640
this is what your kit.
So all the um,

134
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,610
dimly illuminated parts
completely disappear in blech.

135
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,420
Okay?

136
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,280
And, but you see, um,

137
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,120
details in previously to bright scenes.

138
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,900
So that led to over exposure
of your camera. So for example,

139
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:23,840
here you now see the um,

140
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,250
the outline. So the senior
editor of the bulb, for example,

141
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:29,870
okay,

142
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,420
a very long exposure leads to uh,

143
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,230
our overexposure of most of the image.

144
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,260
So you do not see any detail anymore
close to the lamp or ad directly

145
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,180
illuminated surfaces.

146
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
But what you see is that previously dimly
illuminated objects in the background

147
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,240
now are whale perceivable.

148
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,050
Okay?

149
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,050
So this is what you get if you take only
a small part of it dynamic range and

150
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,620
map those to an image.

151
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And what could you do to combine all this
information into one image so that the

152
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,010
most trivial thing you can imagine is I
just divide by the maximum of the scene.

153
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,020
This gives me a nice, um, Newman
ends values from zero to one.

154
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,080
And this I can make to
whatever range I want.

155
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,440
The problem with this is that usually the
maximum is not indicative of the whole

156
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,460
scene.
The maximum is usually extremely bright.

157
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,160
So when you're divided by the maximum,

158
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:42,161
the only thing you see is as a single
reflection in the close to the light bulb.

159
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,390
Okay.

160
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,450
If your Clampett,

161
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,450
so let's say I have arrange of
enters that I'm interested in.

162
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,110
Everything below is,
is clamped by a Ciro.

163
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,470
Everything above my maximum that I
decide to have is completely white.

164
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,580
This is exactly the problem that that
becomes obvious with high dynamic range

165
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,970
that parts are underexposed,
other parts are way exposed.

166
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,130
So clamping also doesn't
get you something. You have
to take the whole range.

167
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,650
You cannot just ignore certain parts.

168
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,840
So one approach that
gives you nice resources,

169
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,190
explanation mapping,

170
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,540
they are us zoom at exponential
distribution in your, um,

171
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,820
luminance values.

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,060
And then rescale is exponential
function into a linear one.

173
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,940
That means that, um, very bright values,

174
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,590
it gets cave down low. Alias
gets scaled up, but you,

175
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,460
you account for the very bright spots.

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,610
So these are the things
that gets caged the most.

177
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,800
So the pride values at the
bow get some reasonable white,

178
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,110
but they do not dominate the whole scene.
Um,

179
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,100
and more sophisticated approaches.

180
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,010
The Reinhart told mapper
developed by Reinhardt, the guy.

181
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,630
Um, and this is um,

182
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,560
this is the one example that they
will present in this lecture. Um,

183
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,920
as you can imagine,
there are many NATO members.

184
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,840
So everyone tried to um,

185
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,370
do some approach that works very
well for a certain subset of scenes.

186
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,480
Some,
um,

187
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,520
methods were optimize to four
parallel hardware or for certain um,

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,380
hardware architectures
to give more speed there.

189
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,700
Sam presented rough approximation
that work in real time.

190
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,820
So there is already a quite wide
bunch of tone may pose to choose from.

191
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,520
Um, that I end how tone may
is one of the most common.

192
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,530
So if you're look into some at our open
source or commercial rendering software,

193
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,630
this is usually one of the
things to this implement.

194
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,010
So, um, entity,

195
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,760
there is also some additional
information to put this into context.

196
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,940
Um,
there is some,

197
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,190
um,

198
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,770
some approach in digital
photography to take, um,

199
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,560
multiple exposure images.

200
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,980
So to combine,
um,

201
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,260
exposures of the same scene

202
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,780
that are taken with different
exposure times into one image.

203
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,030
So this is called high dynamic range
photography and usually to use similar

204
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,950
methodologies.

205
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,951
So the iron hot tone mapa can also be
used to combine or for HDR photography.

206
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,390
But if you put a HDR
photography into Google,

207
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,480
you usually end up with images like that.

208
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,400
And this is not for Tom may
pick is about tone mapping is a

209
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,950
perceptually and physically validated
approach that gives you realistic

210
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:38,300
impressions of the scene and
it's not an artistic effect.

211
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,990
So it's not that you take tone
mapping, look at the image and say, ah,

212
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:47,150
I would like to have it to have more
contrast in there and then you change your

213
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:51,050
tone member. I mean, this is
not, it didn't stand at use.

214
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,230
And the community of HDR
photography to a large extent over,

215
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,360
uh, uses this capability
of the system. For example,

216
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:07,361
this photograph here is a completely
botched implementation or use of Hdr,

217
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,480
uh,
range compression for example,

218
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,190
things that you see that are not correct.
Um,

219
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,150
the halos around the balloons.
So sadly,

220
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,330
why the sky is brighter around
the silhouettes of the balloons.

221
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,390
This is, um, this is, uh,

222
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,830
an effect that is present in the
visual system to some extent,

223
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,190
but not to this extent.
So this is,

224
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,050
some people think that this is nice,
nice HDR photography,

225
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,480
but this is just wrong.
Simply a state.

226
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,380
If you like that your
images look like that,

227
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,530
then this is an artist's
decision not told, met big.

228
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,160
This is just, yeah, contrast
enhancement, you can call it.

229
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,810
Also the colors in this image,
uh,

230
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,650
get screwed up because
they are not oversaturated.

231
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,090
So this is just a warning. The tone
mapping the during counter for, um,

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,300
lights in relations should not look like
that because then you have arr in your

233
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,740
application. Yeah. If

234
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,730
I mean this, this is a combination
of the forensics cultures.

235
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,160
Now it's,
I mean it,

236
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,330
it is a combination of different exposures
and it's taken with a tone mapping

237
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,410
approach and you have to
do the combination somehow.

238
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,760
It said before you can add a device with
a maximum and combined them clamping.

239
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,330
But,
um,

240
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,440
usually the toll paper give
you a more realistic result.

241
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,380
For example,
why is it obvious that here

242
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,760
already multiple exposures were combined?

243
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,750
Because in the very left
of the left,

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,760
you see that you still see some kind
of detailing the boot in behind,

245
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,620
but at the same time use,

246
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,480
you can call us direct look into the
sun without having blood off the screen.

247
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,350
So that means that already a huge
dynamic range was compressed here,

248
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,660
but it should not look like that.

249
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,110
It should look like that
if it's done correctly.

250
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,483
Yeah.

251
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,140
And this would be the correct
application for this photograph.

252
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,780
So it looks a whole realistic.

253
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,610
It doesn't oversaturate the colors.
It only has a very,

254
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,530
uh, light, uh, halo around the cigarettes,

255
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,120
which is also an effect that's
present in the visual system.

256
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,950
So this is what you
should aim for. So, um,

258
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,350
now about tone mapping itself.
Um,

259
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,540
there are two large different classes.

260
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,910
So one or the global total
Mack was and the other local,

261
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,440
so the Global Tome map was used a mapping
function that converts radiums at a

262
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:31,190
certain Pixel to say RTP value.

263
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:36,110
If you select this color space and
this mapping functions uniform,

264
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,100
what I mean here is not that it's uniform,

265
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,740
it produces the uniform output value.

266
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,700
So you don't get a image
with a single color value,

267
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,950
but the function it's safe just takes as
input the radio into certain pixel and

268
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:57,820
the old codes are Gbv and these
functions than used four pixels image.

269
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,210
Okay.

270
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,680
Um,
more complex methodologies are local.

271
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,700
Told me papers,

272
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,020
which not only take the a
single pixel into account,

273
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,050
but also it's in via its neighbors.

274
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,293
Okay.

275
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,230
Um,
this is,

276
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,960
this is perceptually motivated because um,

277
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,330
Seo have seen before,

278
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,350
that's called trust or brightness
adaptation of your eyes in the,

279
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,320
in the photo receptors for example, this
is done locally, so it single fault,

280
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:45,430
the Resectr attempts to
different brightnesses.

281
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,960
So that means that you
told mapping in the human,

282
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,370
I use a local behavior.
Um,

283
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,630
but they are, are, um,

284
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,250
there are reasons to employ both of them.
So the Global Tome mappers,

285
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,830
the are fast because they have a
single mapping function. So you take,

286
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,760
you can execute this function
parallel on each pixel.

287
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,560
So this makes it perfectly usable
for GPU approaches, for example.

288
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,160
But you're encouraged some loss of detail
because you cannot locally look as if

289
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:24,880
the,

290
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,880
is this already a dark patch of my scene
so I can enhance the country's more

291
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,630
there?
Or is it at a dark,

292
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,260
bright boundary where I
do not do it that much?

293
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,780
And the local, uh, don't mappers.

294
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:47,170
And nowadays, so they allow
a local contrast enhancement,

295
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,550
but they are slope because you're not
only have to say, look at the big four,

296
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,110
but also its neighborhood.

297
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
The neighborhood grows a quarter
ethically if you enlarge it.

298
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,710
So, um, the,

299
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,780
you incur a different
complexity in your problem.
