1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,271
Okay.

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:07,271
So we have these two guys in the ring
and we know already how to solve the

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:13,790
elimination equation. The elimination
equation, we don't measure radiants,

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,870
we measure intensity.
It's not really a unit and physics,

5
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,930
it's just some top thing
that happens to work.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,630
Okay?

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,860
In the rendering of the equation,

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,510
we measure radiants and we have to do
some kind of integration. And this is,

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,810
if you, the more you think about it,
the more impossible it will soft too.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,400
Even the thought of solving this problem.
So the first question is,

11
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:44,401
what can I earn by solving this equation
because I have to be motivated to do

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,560
it. So obviously there
is all better, be better,

13
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,050
look really good in order to be of need,

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,870
the motivation and the
resources to solve it.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,830
So this is an itch from the first
assignment and this we have computed with

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,300
recursive ray tracing. So
you can see, for instance,

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,310
hard shadows and you can see that
this is a reasonably boring image.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,060
I mean,

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,060
it's great compared to the
simplicity of the model that we have,

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,690
but it's not really the
greatest. Well, what is missing?

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,910
Let's take a look and look very closely.

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,850
Let's take a look at the very same scene,

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,810
but not with recursive ray tracing factor,
global illumination logarithms.

24
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,920
So not the illumination equation,
but the full rendering equation.

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,170
Take a look at the difference.
Look closely.

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,010
This is full global illumination.
Ah,

27
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,710
finally. Absolutely beautiful.
Let's take another loan.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,160
This is recursive ray tracing
and global illumination.

29
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:53,870
So apparently there are some effects
that recursive ray tracers cannot account

30
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,840
for. What are these events? Well,

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,230
we have talked about indirect
illumination or color bleeding.

32
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:01,580
This is the very same thing.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,690
This means that I am hitting to
diffuse objects one after each other.

34
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,340
Is this visible enough? Okay. I'm just
pulling things on this earth. Are you guys

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,470
okay? Perhaps slightly better,
right? Mm hmm. Yes. Yeah. Okay,

36
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,020
cool. So these are in this
case led parts. What's that?

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,811
What does it mean?

38
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:31,950
Everyone knows you start out from the
light source to him to diffuse objects and

39
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,784
the GTI.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,293
Excellent.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,380
Now, indirect illumination
is all around us, everywhere,

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
both in the real world and both in
the better computer games out there,

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,740
which have the approximations
of indirect elimination.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,300
And you can see that on the left
image it almost looks like Photoshop.

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
It is completely

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,863
okay

47
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,950
alien from its surroundings.

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,590
It is almost as if he didn't take
into consideration in surroundings.

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,140
They are standing in the front, in the
middle of the desert, not just somewhere.

50
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,290
You would have to have some color bleeding
effect that you get from your son and

51
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,190
this is what usually the problem is
with many of the fall shop delicious.

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,700
You just reviled the person from somewhere
and you put it in a photograph and it

53
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,010
looks super fake and yes,

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,710
mostly because of the
illumination conditions.

55
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,260
But even if you try to account for that,

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,390
even if you tried to recall to have more
at the same color scheme than than the

57
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,440
rest of the photograph,

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,670
you're still missing the interactive
combination effect and the human values

59
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,680
very keen in recognizing them.

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,980
So you recognize that something is
wrong but you don't know what exactly is

61
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,620
missing.
And it's usually indirect illumination,

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,770
but there's something else.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,310
Let's take a look at this scene
with recursive ray tracing.

64
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:02,220
So we have refractive materials.
For instance,

65
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:06,150
this plastic sphere on the left of
your spirit in the middle and they're

66
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,000
completely and a diffuse
sphere under right.

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,060
Let's take a look at how the
very same scene looks like.

68
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,070
What would the domination,

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,060
this is the difference one more
time because the freight tracing

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,360
and global illumination,

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,410
so like we have talked about this before,

72
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,110
I can see that differences
in interactive elimination.

73
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,350
So on the on the upper left I can see
that some of the rent collar is bleeding

74
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:41,320
on to the other wall and the very same
with the green wall in the background.

75
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,640
Also with case diffuse balls.

76
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:49,641
So even the simple diffuse sphere looks
much more interesting and much more

77
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,604
beautiful

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,780
with global illumination.

79
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,660
Don't say anything,
but I say something else.

80
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,160
I see something else as well.
Not only indirect elimination.

81
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:06,161
I see some other effect on this image
that I couldn't compute with ray phrase

82
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,330
search before.
Don't say anything.

83
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,000
Raise your hand if you know
what I'm talking about.

84
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,510
Excellent hours that we want and
what don't say anything. Okay.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,673
All right.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,410
I'm talking about this and this.
So this interesting

87
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,880
light effects on the wall and
being oldest, the glass sphere.

88
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,560
So raise your hand again if you know
what, what, what this is exactly. Okay.

89
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,590
Don't say anything because so many people
know you will have to say all of you

90
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:46,250
at the same time after
three. Got It. Okay.

91
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:50,510
So everyone, one, two,

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,810
three. What is this? This motion?

93
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,863
Yes.

94
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,500
Okay.
What are any other guesses?

95
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,913
Infection.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,740
That's technically your fraction. Yes,
but that's not how we call the offense.

97
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,203
Anyone else?

98
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,460
Yeah.

99
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,180
Okay. This is what we
call costings. So what,

100
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:17,540
what kind of life path is this? This is
an interesting life path in this case.

101
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,840
This is l s. S, t, e. Y.

102
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,640
Because we started out
from the light source,

103
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,690
we hit the glass sphere from the outside.
Then we have refraction,

104
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:31,691
we he did from the inside and then we
hit some diffuse object that is either

105
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,550
this checkerboard down there or the red
wall on the left and down to the eye.

106
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,460
And if we have this effect down,
we are going to have costings.

107
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,530
It's the beautiful,
beautiful phenomenon in nature.

108
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,690
Yeah.

109
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,850
That we can find the account for and it's,

110
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,083
hmm.

111
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,030
And then you can, you can see
this at many, many places.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,593
No.

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,080
Let's take a look at another example.

114
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:04,081
This is the famous school
corridor example from Luxor under.

115
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,590
Okay. We have requested rate
tracing and global illumination.

116
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,570
So you can see lots of indirect
illumination. This, this reddish light

117
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,930
on [inaudible]

118
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,510
the floor and perhaps some costings or
at least caustic looking thing in front

119
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,430
of the lockers. Yeah. So next question.

120
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,890
What is the definition of shadows again?

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,340
So what we have said before that shadows
are regions that are not visible from

122
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,530
the light source.
Now,

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,980
an alternative definition of
shadows is the absence of light.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,970
This is what definition we will using
global illumination. So there is,

125
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,220
you could say that there's no such
thing as shadows. There's no, uh,

126
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,690
but that's, that's not something,
that's just the sense of something else.

127
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,470
If there is less light somewhere,
then there's going to be shadows.

128
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,290
So this is the definition of Cheryl's
in local illumination and the enzyme

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,670
culture.
And take a look at this image.

130
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,460
We can see some beautiful,
beautiful, soft shadows.

131
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,370
And the thing is that you don't even
need to do anything to compete DC

132
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,770
illumination. So if I have
a ray tracer, what do I do?

133
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,970
I shoot out shadow raised from these
regions and I tried to approximate what

134
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:27,971
regions of the light source are visible
from this point in global illumination.

135
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:31,850
You don't need to do anything.
You just solve this equation and outcomes.

136
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:35,660
Physical reality and shadows
are parts of physical reality.

137
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,360
You don't need to do anything
in order to obtain shadows.

138
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,980
It's not like a bottom up
approach like ray tracing. So you,

139
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,970
you start from a baseline and you add
more and more hacks to account for more

140
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:47,900
and more effects.

141
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,160
And for global illumination you will see
that we will have a simple algorithm.

142
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,703
Hm?

143
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,900
Jeff can give you all this and you
don't need to account for shadows and

144
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,580
costings and all of these things.

145
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,620
Another beautiful example of costings.

146
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,070
This is caustics from the point
light source because for instance,

147
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,320
you can take a look at the shadow.
The shadows are hard.

148
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:16,910
So it's likely to be a small or a light
source. And the costings are very sharp.

149
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,080
So they have the same behavior
to large light sources as shadows

150
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,330
and another beauty with costings.

151
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,280
Okay,
so let's assess what these recursive,

152
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:36,500
very tracers that are capable of
doing and what they can as well.

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,540
Obviously they cannot compute,

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,600
interacted with Aisha in their activation
means to diffuse bounces or possibly

155
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:47,600
more this you cannot compute. Correct.

156
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,550
We'll talk about

157
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,063
why

158
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,670
and when you cannot compute
costings. Well, costings, I
have written in the future

159
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,240
scenes ago that it was l s s e,

160
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,260
so to specular PolicyCenter diffuse
because you have to go through the glass

161
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,350
ball and here I'm writing
something completely different.

162
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:15,820
I just say one specular balance is
necessary. The rest are optional.

163
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,830
Is this true or how can
we verify this is cute.

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,793
Yeah.

165
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,770
In order to find out if this is true or
not, I don't even need to say a word.

166
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,630
I can just do this.

167
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,290
You see the cost savings,

168
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,460
swollen costs in spot. Yeah. You too.

169
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:47,294
See Ya.

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,220
Yes.
Excellent.

171
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,730
[inaudible] no steal. Gets
my, it's my wedding ring.

172
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:01,560
Might be my fiance is going to kill me.
Okay.

173
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
You have to have seen it. Yep. Okay.

174
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,203
Yeah.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,033
Nice

176
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,930
in
uniform.

177
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,873
Okay.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,510
Okay,

179
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,510
so apparently rings have cost X.

180
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,800
Well, I start off from the light source.
I think one specular object. One,

181
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:39,490
we're like object, and then a
diffuse, which is the table.

182
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,510
And then Deanna and I have coffee.
So [inaudible] is enough for costs.

183
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,700
There's no need to prove
it in any other way.

184
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,150
Just take a look at physical reality
and let it be your crutch. Always.
