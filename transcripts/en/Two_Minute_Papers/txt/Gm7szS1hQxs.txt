Speaker 1:          00:00          Let's go with a simplified version of the whole thing. We're gonna talk about simplify BRDF mouse. Well, there's going to be the MBN BRDF. How does it look like? Well first, first on the last side, I see I, this is intensity. Well what is this? Well, no one knows because we have not radiance, not something very physical here. This is going to be the simplified version of the whole rendering equation. Basically a bunch of packs. If you love something that is vastly simplified, it doesn't really have a physical meaning. It doesn't have physical units, but it works. It's beautiful and it's a good way to understand what's going on. So the intensity that we measure is going to be an NBN, the product of an MBN coefficient of an object. This is dependent of the object. This means that, uh, this means something like the color of the object and the eye is going to be the intensity, the ambient intensity of a scene or the light source.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And uh, later on you're going to be talking about why this is interesting. So this is an example. We have a blue object over here. And it's the same color everywhere. Why? Because the farm in 1000 depends on anything. There's just one for efficient that's multiplied by this intensity of the scene. So that's an NBN shading. Uh, what else is dark? There's the diffuse BRDF. This is what we compute is a diffuse coefficient. What is the diffuse color? The diffuse Albido of this thing. And there's going to be a product ofL and. M. This is what we did before. Do you feels objects look like that? Uh, please raise your hand if you have ever done any kind of diffuse lung version model in graphics. Okay, excellent. Great. And just another thing, this, uh, diffuse cooperation is the very least RGB. Okay. So this is how much light is not absorbed on every different wavelength because I cannot describe collars in one number at the very least RGV or a continuous spectrum just for the record.

Speaker 1:          02:19          And now it's looking better because I can more or less see where the light source is with for this fuel shading. Uh, there's also a specular BRDF when I compute is the V. Dot. Hard times of specular coefficient. And v is the vector pointing towards the viewer. And our is to reflected, there's going to be examples of that. So just that you see the formula and there's an l which has a shyness factor, uh, in the next assignment you will play with this yourself. So for now I will keep this a secret, but this exact with us and what side we're going to junk food is because I would like to ask a question later on and you're going to find out the solution. Excuse me. So this is how the specular highlights look. And if I add up all of these things MBL and diffused and specular, I get some complex looking, a model that looks something that is, that approximates a physical reality. So I just simply add all these terms of, uh, okay, well I have something like this here and I have on purpose removed the light source from this image. But probably everyone can tell where the light source is expected to be. All right, so raise your hand if you know her the lies or should be. Okay, cool. Where should it be?

Speaker 1:          03:52          Above exactly. Exactly. So it's going to be above is fierce and this is exactly where it is. So these material models are descriptive in the way he does that. I get images that have some physical meaning that resemble physical reality. Well, let's, let's take a look at an actual example. Uh, the question is what would this region look like? The one that I marked like this pixel, if pixels existed in the real world, uh, would it look the same if I moved my head in reality and that sound that sounds like you know, this, it sounds like a tricky question. Yeah, I have seen the answer. Yes. Uh, well, uh, let's say that this part is purely the fuse. I don't see many specular reflections in there. The fuse is l. Dot. M. So light, lighter direction, times to normal. Does it change if I move my head? Well, how do I answer this question? You don't really need to see what is in an equation. You are off. You, you have to be aware of what is not in there.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Does it change if I move my head, raise your hand if you know the answer. It's very apparent on many or few. Yes, yes. The change. If I move with them, okay, I'm going to change because the specularity might move. Yes, that's, that's very true. So it doesn't change because we know that it doesn't change. I mean the walls look the same. Uh, if I, if I move around, I mean not talking about shapes, I'm talking about collars. They don't change and mirror. However it does change. Uh, and the mathematical reason for this is that the view direction is not in this equation. I can change the view of their actual all I want and nothing will change in the diffuse to be out here.

Speaker 1:          05:51          So this is like a general mathematical, a trick or, uh, principles that you can use in a number of different things. Don't just, don't just look at what variables are in there. Uh, tried to think of variables, what you would imagine that would be there and okay, why are they missing? And that's, that's also information. That's what they're not the only one stamp at what is missing is valuable information. So what about these regions? These are specular highlights. These are described by the specular BRDF V. Dot. R. So view indirection times there are reflected a light direction and let's actually compute what's going on. So I would be interested in the intensity, this fake something of this point where this is a delight vector. This is where it points to, it is probably reflected somewhere there because it comes in and it's an ideal reflections. So it's gonna be reflected in this direction.

Speaker 1:          06:52          And this is where I am just for example. So I'm interested in V. Dot. R. Well this is going to be a cosign. Uh, there is a small angle between the Emr. So if there's a small lag loan that's course sign of a small number that's large, that's goes to one and that's going to be a huge scalar product. Therefore, this point is bright and this is indeed broke. And the question is, which is a very easy to insert in a second, is does it change if I move around, does it change? Obviously it does change because v is in the equation. And if I change this around in different, uh, for the specular BRDF, this is going to be bright and just one of my favorite intuitions of this leader arm because otherwise this is just letters. This means how much am I standing in the way of the life? So a life lesson, if you can't find the water droplets on the floor after having a shower, move your head around because that specular if the windshield of a car is too bright and it's, and you just can't take it anymore, move your head around this, this, this connects to the physical reality around us. And that's good tips in case you didn't know that you need to move your hand around, you brought down, oh, now you're low.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Okay. So, uh, this is the, the, the point where we can just for a second stop and marvel at how beautiful things we can create with such simple equations and they're under a new equation is going to be even looking to fold in that lane infinitely more beautiful. And there is some additional beauty that you can think about. And when you look at images like that, okay, how will I shape this point? Is this diffuse? If is the specular, why does it look the way? So you can, if you nothing better to do. You can think about these things when on public transport, uh, let's call this thing that illumination equation. This is the faith simpler version of the rendering equation. Now what is in there? Most of this is familiar days and MBN chain term. And then there's the diffuse l. Dot. M there is the specular veto are we add all these together and we multiply this by the amount of incoming light because if there's no light sources in the scene, there is no light.

Speaker 1:          09:24          Light is not coming from anywhere. Therefore this is all divided by zero. If there's a bright light source that things get brighter. So we multiply by this incoming light. And what is important to know is that this is only the direct effect of light sources. Uh, this sounds a bit esoteric at the moment, but later on a few lectures down the road, we're going to be all about indirect illumination and Moody's life. That and this is neglected and the MBM term is used to make up for it. You will see examples of this in the next lecture and this is a crude approximation but it's still beautiful. It's easy to understand and it serves as a stepping stone to solve the real vendor mission. Uh, but this has not done one thing is that if there are multiple light sources, the scene is expected to be brighter.

Speaker 1:          10:14          So I would compute the whole thing for multiple light sources. So there's going to be a sum in there and the inside the some lists that indexes are the number of light sources. Basically just, I just didn't want to overcomplicate this. Uh, but still something is still missing. This is, this is not done. I arrived to a point, I compute this specular ambient and diffuse shading and I am not done. Let's discuss how ray tracing works and we'll find out. So the first thing is that what you see here is non trivial because what you would imagine is that you start shooting grace from the light source and then some of the rays would make up to make it to the camera, to your eye and, and most of them won't. So we go with a simple, uh, optimization that we turned the whole thing around.

Speaker 1:          11:10          And then we start tracing grace from the camera. Because if I start racing from there, I can guarantee that I deem it raised that are not wasted because the, I'm not interested in the light rays to not make it to the camera. So if I started from there, I can guarantee that this is not wasted to computation. So how do we do this? There is this camera plane, we will discuss how to construct such a thing and we construct race through this camera plane. And what I'm interested in is the projection of the three d world to display. This is what you will see on your monitor. So I should raise from this camera and I intersect this against objects that are in the scene. I want to know where is the light stopping, where, what objects does it hit and where does it get reflected?

Speaker 1:          12:02          So the second is intersection with an objects. I have to realize that it hits this sphere. Then I stopped there. I compute the Basie shaming turns like the diffuse and the rest, and then I don't stop there, but I'm interested in where the light is reflected. I need to continue from here and this light, this light lightweight, maybe reflected or refracted, and I need some kind of recursion in order to come from that for that. And the recursion works in the following way. I stop at this point where I hit the ball, the sphere, and what I do is that I imagined that this is now the starting point of the rain and I'm shooting very outwards and I start this ray tracing algorithm again. So this is how the recursion works. This was missing from the formula, and this is just what the text version of what I have set for those who are reading this at home. And you're going to deal with reflections for stuff.
