Speaker 1:          00:01          Next time. What you will see is something that was missing from many of the big goal orientations of many assignments. What, what is it? What is the complexity of the ray tracing algorithm? Depending on what it depends on the resolution, the bigger the English, the longer it takes. Got It. It is exponential with respect to the death at least this implementation is if you, if you should have to raise, there is always a branching. Damn, this is going to be exponential, so we have taken into consideration resolution. We have taken into consideration depth but we haven't taken, taken into consideration how many objects there are in the scene and if you start running the same ray tracer on huge thing because you don't want to see spheres, you won't want to do ray tracing like real men do, then what you do is you implement a function that can load.

Speaker 1:          00:57          You try, we'll measures and then you just grab a Nice Triangle Mesh and I seen from somewhere loaded to your ray tracer and you very excitedly the ray tracer and you don't get anything in your whole lifetime. If you lose something with millions of and which voltages, not much nowadays. Why someone else. Yeah, so fixed. Wrong. That's true. But why does it take too long? Because you have to do a lot of intersections lists. Exactly. So I have, if I have 1 million objects, I have to do one minute intersections every single time. That's too much. That's just way too much. So what we can do is that we can do some kind of space partitioning, which means that simple optimizations I can do, for instance, I really don't care what is behind me because I'm going to intersect something that's in front of me. So whatever is behind me, I can immediately throw this, all of those polygons out, that's immediately half of it.

Speaker 1:          01:58          And if you use smart tricks and Katie trees, smart tricks, smart data structures, you can go from linear while in the air one way or objects, one minute intersections. So that's linear complexity. You can go to local rhythmic complexity, which is amazing because the logarithm after a point, it doesn't really increase too much. And you will learn about techniques that will make you able to compute this intersection with like 1 million objects, with about four or five intersections of leverage. Obviously obviously it depends on the distribution of the triangles and all of that, but on average you can do it in four or five intersection instead of one Lillian, so it's a huge shoot. Speed up. This is going to be out the next spectrum,

Speaker 1:          02:52          and again it seems that I have been lying to you all along regarding this as well because I told you that are measuring radiants for uh, than the equation. Now radiants I cannot really display on my monitor or what can I display in my minor RGB values. So there has to be some transformation that comes from radios and converted to RGB in a meaningful way. This process is called and told that big and Thomas is going to tell you all about that thing as well. You can do it in a number of different ways. It's happening on the trivial and the good tone back. They, it really breathes life into your rendered images.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Now we haven't talked about filtering. This is a bit more sophisticated recursive ray tracing you show you should one sample through the mid point of the big source of leucine. You computed this, you're done with Monte-carlo integration. We are going to have many samples so we are going to have a metric that's called samples for big soul and these samples will not go through the mid point of the Pixel. These are going to go through the surface of the pixel like random samples over the surface of the pixel and we are going to integrate the valiums over the whole surface. Now you can do this differently because you have many samples over the pixel surface and you can take into consideration them into consideration the different ways and you can see that different filtering method. This is what we call filtering and different filtering methods will give you different results and the interesting part is that you will get anti aliasing for free if you do filtering well because in a ray tracer you will shoot one race through the mid point of the Pixel.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Your images, unless they are super high resolution, they are going to be areas. The completely straight line is going to be pixelated. The edges are going to be pixilated. What can you do? Feel things like super sampling. Let's split one pixel into 400 pixels for smaller pixels and compute the race through all of them and leverage. That's the Vivian method that gives you anti-aliasing by supercenter, but this is super expensive. I mean you have HD resolutions and you have to bump this up by even four times too much. There's better solutions. You can get this for free. You global elimination if you do feel different, so this is what filtering is about.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Domestic is also going to talk, this is not one retro is the next three lectures it's going to talk about participate in media. What is this about? Well, in our simulations so far we have taken into consideration that race of flight only bounce off of surfaces, but in real life there's not only surfaces, there's volumes that smoke haze. Many of these effects where array of light can not really hit an object but just small and get scattered. And if you do your simulation in a way that it supports such participate in medium, then you can get volume costs and that's amazing because I just have shown you the ring and whatever else kind of costings and we'll look at, you will think of those as as some two d things that I see it on the table, this diffuse material that that diffuses this rate inspect to me. So you would think that sticks and shadows are playing are they are two deep things but they are in fact volumes. So the shallows exist not only the plane but they have the volume because the, the set of points that are extracted from the light source or not on the plane, they are in three d.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Yeah

Speaker 1:          06:57          and you can get volumetric castex and volume shuttles with participating in media media because there will be immediate, immediate in terror of which light can scatter. So therefore you will see these boundaries. You can also get God rays. Beautiful, phenomenal in curriculum in that nature. If you compute participating,

Speaker 2:          07:25          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:26          You can also get something like this. This is an actual photograph just to make sure that you see the difference that the, the first raid is traversing the air or vacuum and the next ones haven't participated in Edo which can give you discipline, this scattering effect. And another example of God rays while apparently we have this do not disturb.

Speaker 2:          07:54          Okay

Speaker 1:          07:55          piece of paper. So there is some lacks render and then going on in this room, you better not enter who knows what you will see and you can get, not necessarily suck pronounced effects, but the more subtle effect that you can, you can feel that there is some, he's in this image but it's, it's not super.

Speaker 2:          08:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Now we don't stop there because don't just think of of smoke and atmosphere. You can just look at your own skin if you would like to see some participating helium. Now this is a phenomenon he called subsurface scattering and this means that some of the things that you would think our objects are, uh, surfaces are in fact volumes. This is your skin. For instance, light goes through your skin portion of light. And we don't simulate that because when we hit the surface of the object, we though you bet. And if we write this innovation that makes us evil to go inside of these objects, then we have a simulation with subsurface scattering and we kind of come from beautiful, beautiful effects like this. These are some simulations. So for instance, on the left side you can see probably in the marble there's subsurface scattering in marbles. It seems heavily exaggerated to me or either there is a really, really strong that lighting, but this is not a surface anymore. You can see the nose of the lady light. Lots of softer radiants actually gets the food to those. This is one more example. This is not so pronounced and this is, this is not so exaggerated, but you can see this. J Dragon clearly has some subsurface scattering who kept the home tickling same parts like the end of the tail. You can see that it's much lighter and this is because some of the light is going through it and the optical [inaudible] thick parts like the body of the dragon have less subsurface scattering. So you can see that this is a bit darker. It's a beautiful phenomenon. And we can also see lead this.

Speaker 1:          10:12          I look at, look at this one. Absolutely amazing that doesn't this look amazing. This is incredibly awesome. We can ride computer programs that can compute this reasonable amount. So absolutely beautiful phenomenon. I still kept this as well. This is a fractal. It's subsurface scattering. I mean, how, how cool can someone get it's fractals and subsurface galleries. It's like two of the best foods mixed together. It's is, it has to be something else. And another example of a beautiful jade dragon with just a bit of subsurface scattering.

Speaker 2:          11:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:04          So that's going to be it for today and there's going to be the next three lectures with us. These are all the exciting things that are going to be discussed and that we will complete the Monte Carlo integration. I will tell you how I lied to you exactly. And how do you use mathematics to see from these lies and that maybe the right, our global illumination program. Thank you.
