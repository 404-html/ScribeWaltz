Speaker 1:          00:00          Let's take a look at how the exact that really looks like

Speaker 1:          00:06          I have a recursive function where what I'm looking for first is if I have reached the maximum depth that I would like to, if I say that I would drive to them there by volunteers and this is going to be fine. Did I did that? I reach this number of policies? Yes. Okay. Done. Just top at the time of that and that all will be is the space that what I'm looking for these, the nearest intersection you remember from the previous lecture, that means I with actually before yours, which I sold eat. So what I'm just did, he said, I am intersecting a lot of objects and I'm only interested in the very first intersection and if I didn't take anything then I will be to a black color because there's no energy.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Oh boy. Uh, in this room,

Speaker 1:          00:58          wow. If I have the intersection of the object, I will be interested in the ignition and the material of this object and we shouldn't means that if this is a light source that is going to happen and the material can be RB, the RDF, it feels philosophy or some complicated

Speaker 2:          01:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:18          material. This, I'm going to store on that.

Speaker 1:          01:22          What's up next? Well, I went back to construct a new, right. You guess I would face the next grade so I can I is that she has a low rate. This was start wherever I think this object, so if I keep them feeble I will create a new radar starts on the people and I will set the outgoing direction according to Samhsa, the up. Let's see that what they have here. If it says it's random and you need to back already he have a sphere ball where the object was. It sounds like it'd be a few speed for me, so I generate the random you'll need factor is, and this is going to be the outgoing, correct. Now let's add together the elements of the random equation. I have the cosign that you thought was just the light attenuation. I have to be already at term. And even the BRDF term, it seems that here they have also included is the the art, which is the lie, that animation. This is the veto of the material.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:23          how much light is absorbed and how much it's reflected. And then what I would like to do is I want to call the very same function that you see the

Speaker 1:          02:36          well number one. So this is a recursive function. I would start the same process again with the new grade, those starting point and he'd be out if I had phrased a sufficient number of race time exit this week, Persia, I collect the result of this in this variable that's called reflected. And in the end, this is the elegant and patient. Rather than get Queneisha [inaudible], he l me plus the integrated option, which is the BRDF times, uh, this reflected which is older, the personal terms, what do you mean stuff out this way? We have these here and there's going to be many subsequent boxes. And I ended up all this energy input reflected in family life. So this is a pseudo false, this is not, this is not something that you should fight the file or anything like that, but this is what we bill the code. Do you need done next lecture? This is just a schematic overview review on what is happening exactly. It's like who do you shoot away, you bounce it to the scene and then we hopefully get the light sources and even if we hit the lights or should we continue? Do you think the light source is important? Because this is where we short term passport.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Let me show you what's what's going on. If we don't need light sources. So is Lee is the initial term on the left side here. So we add this to the help resolve every coach stuff. And a fundamental question is that if we have a long life path that doesn't keep the light source, we are using completely random stuff. Maybe sauce mark important. Stop me. Well yeah he never, they're never happy submission. Okay. What does this mean? That the regions that we, we give we get from the program is going to be zero. So the Corolla or you have this is that won't be, you won't get food from all the lighthouse that keep alive. So if you don't get the lights off, you don't know where the light is coming from. So you will be a black. So, and this is obviously a really bad and because you're computing churning out samples out samples and samples perhaps on your Gpu, but then it doesn't fit the fact the QT or effect of all simple life path crazy is that if you have a small light source, if Americans off yours, you're finally just going to be slower.

Speaker 2:          05:23          Why

Speaker 1:          05:27          smaller light sources more Merriam's stolen those Benito run the race, the load source smaller than you want to do this. Exactly. Exactly. Be less for a small life and up to the extreme where we have at 0.5 source and if we have a point back source then we'll see that we will be in trouble because what I would expect from my officers to return something like what we imagined the point light source. Yeah, but this is not what we will end up with so I wouldn't expect him to return the correct results. Many people have reported many forums on the Internet that hey, I implemented it but this is what I got. Wow, this, this doesn't work at all on all these pronounced law. So now it's a little tunnel inflection, wanting cower individually for a black image. I mean I could generate this with five months of c plus plus. Why? Why do we even bother? We will get nothing. Why is that point light source like image quiet.

Speaker 2:          06:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Yes, exactly. Exactly. Sort of point represents a location in mathematics. He doesn't not have area, so technically it is the same. Getting appointed by the source is impossible because you said it the same as what you study statistics and probably can feel that if you have one member in a continuous scale. What is the problem of hitting this number? Zero because that's what the point it has local service center. If you smoke you cannot get it.

Speaker 2:          07:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:27          so they sent the reason off your [inaudible] fine not. We could also sound our findings, Internet meme style if you will. So if you would like to compute or facing that source, we're not a technique that is called next amount destination. Then usually we'll expect a wonderful image, but this is what you're looking at.

Speaker 2:          07:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:59          The first question is obviously how will you work? Calendars we give you is that every time we add something, some object and just be it the fuse for anything but not light sources, we can view the direct effect of the light source on this point.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:17          so this is a schematic to show what is going on. So I started from the viewer. I hit this theater and I don't just start placing the luminary outwards, but I will connect this point to the light source and I compute the director limitation. This is the schematic for PAF facing without the next event estimation and this is with next event estimations sweat. Every station I connect to the light source. In this case this is actually a polluted in this case this is the biddable and then the third bounce you will get some contributions from the light source. The question is how do we do this exactly? Well this is the topic is what's the talking about the silence. The formula that you see in the assignments you is exactly the very same thing.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:13          What wasn't there? Well, what were you going interested in is there was the term with the four or five because if you have a light source that's a sphere than what you would then be or interested in how much we answers admitted in one direction so then you will need to divide by the area of the surface which is a division by four pipe and there's going to be the attenuation through which is all squared. Same as in the gravitational law or even law electric fields. It needs that. The first and a way I am from the lights or the last month is going to,

Speaker 1:          09:56          this is the really good technique because of multiple reasons and one of the reasons is that you will get contributions every mouse to the building to life. Before I proceed, I would like to tell you that here is, we are talking about this and you shutter and we are adding this parts of this admission in every boss. So if I hit p one I had the something if I need to be too. I had this something. If I eat wheat and I also add something, but when I hit the light source, I don't have the initial term anymore because I will be at me get hooked yet. So this one attribute that you would add when you get the light source, by chance, this is distributed into an individual policy. Why is this great? We kind of have a point light sources because the direct effect you can actually measure, but you cannot hit the light sources.

Speaker 1:          10:53          So that's great tool. We'll have less parents because it's not like I either eat the light source for, I don't. I statistically always would be the light source unless there are computers. So I'm handling many samples with small variances and that's what's happened. And monitoring because you either win or you don't get anything. So I can lower the variance, which means that my images will convert faster. And the other thing is that because there are contributions of every bounce, I can separate director the direction of the nation. So a lot of people do this in that industry because the movie industry is nowadays using outbreaks in there. Can I see that as a ball and Karposi something statement. But for instance, Disney Disney's mouth and using it in the nation and what he did death most mostly politics. Why? Because it looks insane. The good and it is very simple and took that more than 20 years for them to replace their old system, which they really liked it school base.

Speaker 2:          12:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:08          And that, that'll be our musical freedom office anytime they have a long time. But the benefits of global illumination, our mouth to the professor and what they aren't doing is that they get the physical invasions result. But this is that always what the artists are looking for is if you have worked together with artists.

Speaker 2:          12:30          Okay,

Speaker 1:          12:31          the name of safe. Okay. You have to do to the beautiful image. But I would like the showers together bit brighter.

Speaker 2:          12:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:38          Do you view as the engineer say that this is not possible and you didn't, what will happen in physical reality and that's it. But the artists are interested in physical reality. They are interested in their own thoughts and they're all not just the condition. And he would make a change the shadows. So you could in fact be really make one off the light sources there and that the shadows would get, but that the audience has pain but don't change anything else in the see, just take the shadows and then you could pull out their knowledge of the relevant information that look the radiance coming out from this point, it cancel the surroundings so you cannot just need something brighter and the nearby things, we'll also get fried there. You cannot circumvent why do you can't, what you can do with the Max amount, because condition is that you tick, you generate an image from the first box, so you will get one image which is which you deposit the radiance that you measured in Piedmont.

Speaker 1:          13:36          That's something. And then you pay for that matter we need, which will only contain the second pharmacists, [inaudible] and poppers. So you would have multiple images and you could then I'm going to just add up. All of these images would symbolization that you want to get a physical reality. Great, but if the artist says that I was stronger and directed in the nation, then you would have this bathroom is the image that holds up the second and the higher order advances and you could do some photos off or you can do whatever you want with that without touching anything else. So you have a nice separation for direct and indirect elimination, moving industry, sorry, movie industry. They are all the time and in the later you will see some algorithms that became differently on the indirect elimination and differently on direct examination. You can only do that if you separate these firms.

Speaker 1:          14:34          So let's see, part facing now with Max demand destination, I have the very first bounce and before I continue my way, I will send the classical super, super classical show rate. So the light source, a randomly chosen point of the light and I wouldn't have this direct contribution of delights source to this point. And then I come to you, let's go back to the time. Sorry. We used managers for the very same thing. This is why I'm writing all of these terms because if you at the forums, if you read papers, you will see these terms and they all mean the same. So exquisite light, something Max demand customization I say, so I continue my rate and I also hit the light source would just chat away and then I continue on and on and imagine that this third one is an odd way that actually it's the light source and you find the mood. I don't add the healthy part because I did in the previous policy. It's very important. Now you have seen the results or one five source, nothing versus something. That's what you have to. But even if you have a reasonably big light source, the light light, light sauce, I old you that you'd have various suppression effect as well. So this is sign off on something for, because I think it's two, maybe three cycles per pixel. So this means that I grew up walking soul and my do we race so we won't be far also?

Speaker 2:          16:15          No,

Speaker 1:          16:17          this, you can do it two different ways because if you start to use vendors that we will see how this exactly happens. San renderers are entering the piles. So what they do is that they start with something source and if you say I want Zappos per, then we'll start off, take one more floor or whatever. Not all the threats you have on the other sheet. If we take 47 four weeks old and it was shooting more and more Saturday school and after you've got to long house on samples, it was stop and show you. It would be good input version and what we fall progressive rather Amy's the opposite. You pick one thing so you should to refuel it but only one and then you go to the next and then you go to the them and then see you in an image that has a lot of noise and progressing progressively. You look at lesson, this is what you see here. It's progressing rather no, no one asked him at destination. So we only got contributions if we hit this light source in here. So we look at the blood sample now closely. This is with last demand destination. So there's a huge difference. Such a symbol that he, yes, magazines with orders of. Great. Awesome.

Speaker 2:          17:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:44          You can also play with this program, by the way. He says he did sheet, right?

Speaker 2:          17:47          So when you read this at home, just [inaudible] wait a minute. It's amazing, dude. Fuck.
