Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, let's, let's quickly study how to compete surface marbles because we are going to need that. If you remember the diagrams, we always had the surface from a diffuse specular and the ambient shading. And just a quick remark, in the previous lecture we have talked about diffuse inspecting your shading and also MBN. But these are perhaps the most important was what does simplify the rds. The idea falls and you can see them everywhere. So when you are on public transport you can think about what objects could be, what exact case I'm objects or like a mixture of these BRDF moms. It is possible that I have a diffuse object with a glossy or respect, a little coating on top of it. And you can move your head around like I told you before and and see how the new cost, the object changes. So a lot of beauty to Margo app and you will be able to also understand that for instance, if you watch someone performing stand up comedy is that are usually uh, a law of guys seem to Morris things and they all always we'd wear makeup and the makeup artist tells them that, yes, you need to wear makeup.

Speaker 1:          01:16          And the artist says, I'm a manly guy, I don't want to wear makeup. And they say, well, I don't care. You have to because otherwise you are sparkly. Okay. And this means that they start sweating and if they start sweating that the skin is going to get a bit already and then specular, it's more specular. Sweet means that if I turned my head around it go look a bit different. So there's going to be specular highlights and if you use makeup dandies specular highlights disappear and the whole face is going to be almost perfectly diffused. Therefore it doesn't distract your audience. So trust parties everywhere. So if you ever wear makeup, then think about this specular reflections. Okay? But I digress. So surface normals. I haven't even visited equation F of x, y zero I would like to know the normals of the surface, how to construct a normal well [inaudible] is given by the 20th of the function.

Speaker 1:          02:21          And just a quick, yeah, just a quick reminder to Craig went off the function. This is a three d function of x, Y, Z and the gradient when every quarter that gives you the derivative of the function with respect to a given quarter. Okay, let's see an example. Imagine Elliptic parable out. You don't have to imagine that because there's going to be an image, so this is x squared over a squared and so on. I'm not going to read formula and this is how it looks like and if I would like to put together something like this, then I have to know that a and B are the curvatures of this thing in different different dimensions and therefore these values are scalar values. Well, let's compute the surface normal of this elliptic paraboloid but this would include differentiating the whole equation for the first coordinate with respect to x.

Speaker 1:          03:20          So let's differentiate this with respect to x, but x squared is going to be two x and eight squared is going to remain there because it's a Schema. Multiply it. Why does it depend on x? It doesn't depend on the next effort. False off z. It doesn't depend on x. Therefore the first quarter will be two x over a squared. What about the second term? The second term because the function differentiated with respect to why. Okay. Does x dependent, why no, it's turn is going to be zero. What about this? Why is crime is going to be too wide over [inaudible]? Z doesn't depend on why. Therefore this is going to be the second term. What about the third time I differentiate is function with respect to z. Z, does it depend on x? Someone let me know.

Speaker 1:          04:11          I mean correct. It doesn't depend on him. Does it depend on why? Well, what's going to be the type of this expression? It's going to be minus a bit louder. It's going to be minus one. Okay. Let's see. Okay, we got this so we can cause track the social snowman off an elliptic parabolic. Excellent. So when we do this intersection routine in ray tracing, I have a way, and I would like to intersect this against every single object that is in the room. The question is what is the first object that the ray hits? Which intersection am I interested in? So that may be men. So if I lose summer, I may intersect many different objects. But if things are not translucent or things aren't transparent that I'm only going to see the first intersection and that's it. And the first should be the closest.

Speaker 1:          05:17          So this should be easy because we are using parametric equations, they depend on t and t is the distance. So basically what we get as an output, this is going to be a list of t values that our interests, I am intersecting these objects at least of taste five, 10 miles to things like that. What the question is, which one do I choose out of this list of teas? Simon, help me out. Smiles. I wasn't too t the smallest positive team. Amy. So the negative ones are not interested in like I told you, long politics, politics, free zone. And I wrote to be interested in the smallest positive t. There's those moments, true negative teas we are not interested in. We have discussed this and the question is can we take t equals zero? And I'm not telling this because I would be an annoying mathematician only half metal edition and Land Wunderkinder. Okay, so I'm asking this because I would be annoyed with addition. I'm asking this because this is going to happen if you're right or a tracer. So lots of people are it all something is not working when I have no idea what went wrong. It is possible that t equals zero and we need to handle this case. So just a second, raise your hand if you, if you mow equals zero means intersection. Okay, excellent. I will have some of my own destiny, so okay. Yeah. Just a minute ago.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Okay. Yeah. Ask Her name. Okay, so what's happening with the team to zero? Sorry. Yes, exactly. So if we have some amount of bounces equals zero this means that I am exactly on the surface of the object that I'm bouncing off of. So if I intersect, the guest is sphere and I bounced or a bag the next after the next intersection routine, I am almost guaranteed to see machine precision matters. But mathematically I'm guaranteed a CTO or CEO because it's south intersection. The raid comes to this direction, bounces back from the table, but it is for the top of the team where there's going to be like a trivial intersection which is from the starting point of direct. So we are not interested in this so we are going to take the smallest negative and non zero t. So in cold we usually put there in epsilon like a very small number and we say that if it's the very least this lumber, then I will take the intersection because it's not self intersection anymore.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Okay. After we buy just a smell, beauty break, this is an image rendered with lux render, our glorious renderer. We are going to use this later during the course. Okay. And some more motivation will be able to compute images like that. Isn't this beautiful random photo that's cheating? Well, if you're in the mood to a model, like an extremely high Polycarp seizure, yeah, people do that too. And yeah, but it, it gives you a really realistic lighting off to seat. You can, you can use this thing in a later assignment to create beautiful images. By the way, there's a course gallery, make sure to take a look, because from previous years people have created some amazing, amazing, uh, seeds. Raise your hand if you have seen in this gallery. Okay. From the people who are the people who haven't seen, it's your hand. If you are going to take a look at this after every course. Okay, excellent. You know, I didn't, I didn't see your hand. You have, you have an apple, but you have to be serious. There's some amazing things. I wouldn't say some people should have gone artists instead because this would say something about their knowledge and it's lack of place at all because these terms are really smart guys, but they have some amazing artistic skills and I'm sure that there are some artists inside, some of you as well.
