Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, so why don't we get started. These, I will show you some of the small paint contest assignments from previous years. Is this, is this visible, is this, I think I should pull some of the current,

Speaker 2:          00:18          maybe a bit about that.

Speaker 1:          00:29          So you can see that even with a smoking program you can be can make incredible, incredible scenes.

Speaker 1:          00:39          So this is the thanks. So this is the state of the art lecture. Basically what we are interested in this and the next lecture is starting from the very first algorithm that was ever created to solve the rendering equation, the classical path tracer up to the most sophisticated works, some of them which came out less than a week ago. And I won't go into deep mathematical details for most of these techniques. What I would like you to know is the basic idea and the intuition behind the method and why we are doing the things we do. So deep mathematical details will also be there in the form of links where you can look behind the curtain and you will see what is exactly going on in there. Now before we start with the state of the art park, there's a few things that we need to discuss. One, this person. So we have talked about indices of refraction, the index of refraction for different materials. What was it? It was a number. So in every code, in every program, in every theory, we use numbers. Well, in reality in this is of refractions are not numbers. They are in fact functions.

Speaker 1:          02:03          What does it mean? They could be functions that depend on the wavelength of incoming light. And what it exactly means is that there are materials that refract incoming light of different colors to different directions. And that's quite profound because you will see the beautiful effects of diff dispersion and second, and there are also some supplementary videos that you should take a look at all. This is a good example of it. This is a prison. So you can see that the incoming light is white and the prison does break down to this white incoming light to all possible parlors. There are

Speaker 1:          02:49          another good example of this is rainbows. So whenever you are on a family trip and they are asking what you're looking at and if you accidentally don't say rainbow you will, you will maybe say this person and they will put you in an asylum instead. So, but don't worry, you are correct scientifically and that's all that matters. You can also see and maybe not so beneficial and not so beautiful effect of this person. It is called chromatic aberration. This means that we have a camera lens that is possibly not the highest quality and it can introduce artifacts like this because different colors of light are reflected into different directions and you don't get the sharp initial that you would be looking for.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Wow. This is a dispersion rendered inside lux renders. So you can see that with physically based rendering, you can actually capture this effect and you can also render timelines. So if y'all have a fiance and you would like to buy a rink but you're broke because her university student, then you can just render one. Then you can also render one with this person. But see if you have a nerd girlfriend. Because if salt and maybe she will be happy about it and most people aren't and I speak from experience and you can also see this really beautiful effect in the old old pink Floyd album cover called the dark side of the moon.

Speaker 1:          04:26          There are also some videos about this in the internet rendered with Lux render. Take a look. No. The first question is, is the index of refraction of glass constant? Well let's look it up. Obviously we may have glasses that are made and manufactured in different ways. There are, most of them are not completely clear. They are some kind of some kinds of a mixture. So there are different kinds of class. But let's just pick one randomly from a database that gives you in this of refraction and you can see that it is actually not flat. It is not a constant there. There's something happening in the function. So this means that there are glass tops that have dispersion effects and even only slightly because you can see that we have between the minimum and the maximum, there is not such a large difference, but there is something. So you could say that at least this kind of glass introduces some degree of dispersion. So let's take a look. What do you think about this image that's this caustic, have any kind of dispersion effect or does it not? What do you think? Is it a bit more colorful around the edges or is it completely wild?

Speaker 1:          05:54          Exactly. Did you read okay, could good bit gift. Give me one more opinion. What do you think

Speaker 2:          06:10          it's okay.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Uh, it might be a rainbow but it may be significantly smaller so maybe you would have to zoom in really close to seed or angel. So this is up for debate. We could see that the IOR seems to be non constant and therefore there should be a dispersion effect. Some artists claim that they can spot the difference between a physical based render. Even for materials like that and simple RGB rendering where you cannot render these dispersion affects correctly. This is up for debate whether you can see it, but science says that yes there is. Even if there is a slight difference, there is a difference. It feel right to more know more about this person. There is this wonderful series called cosmos, a spacetime Odyssey. Have any of you heard of this before? Raise your hand. Okay. If you are, feel so. This is, this is, this is hosted by the magnificent Neil degrasse Tyson.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Yeah, Neil degrasse Tyson and you should absolutely watch it. So everyone who hasn't watched it yet, I'd like to hear your excuse or at least I like to hear that you will go home and watch it. So this, this episode is about that this Persian mostly and we will know all about this person if you want. Okay. Now we have another question because we have written an RGB render. So we if if you look up the source code of small paint everywhere, you just see RGB, RGB, RGB. How do we write a correct physically based render? And even before that, how do we even represent light in the visible spectrum? Not a good answer to this is to introduce a function that describes how much light is carried at different wavelengths. Now this will be a continuous function that we could call spectral power distribution. And you can see that at these lower wavelength, there is not too much light carried on the higher wavelength there. There's more. So you can put this representation into your render, and what you would do is that you would just a knife solution, you would pick a randomly chosen wavelength and you would trace way into the scene using this way of life. And if you do this, you can actually do another kind of Monte Carlo integration because you also add one more dimension of integration. And this one more dimension would be overweight lens

Speaker 1:          09:02          because you would also be, still has stickily taking random samples of the rendering equation for a given wave flags in a given collar. And then you would need to sum it up somehow to get a sensible solution. There's more about this in PBR t chapter five.

Speaker 2:          09:17          Okay.
