Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So we have these two guys in the ring and we know already how to solve the elimination equation. The elimination equation, we don't measure radiants, we measure intensity. It's not really a unit and physics, it's just some top thing that happens to work.

Speaker 2:          00:22          Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:22          In the rendering of the equation, we measure radiants and we have to do some kind of integration. And this is, if you, the more you think about it, the more impossible it will soft too. Even the thought of solving this problem. So the first question is, what can I earn by solving this equation because I have to be motivated to do it. So obviously there is all better, be better, look really good in order to be of need, the motivation and the resources to solve it. So this is an itch from the first assignment and this we have computed with recursive ray tracing. So you can see, for instance, hard shadows and you can see that this is a reasonably boring image. I mean, it's great compared to the simplicity of the model that we have, but it's not really the greatest. Well, what is missing? Let's take a look and look very closely. Let's take a look at the very same scene, but not with recursive ray tracing factor, global illumination logarithms. So not the illumination equation, but the full rendering equation. Take a look at the difference. Look closely. This is full global illumination.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Ah, finally. Absolutely beautiful. Let's take another loan. This is recursive ray tracing and global illumination. So apparently there are some effects that recursive ray tracers cannot account for. What are these events? Well, we have talked about indirect illumination or color bleeding. This is the very same thing. This means that I am hitting to diffuse objects one after each other. Is this visible enough? Okay. I'm just pulling things on this earth. Are you guys okay? Perhaps slightly better, right? Mm hmm. Yes. Yeah. Okay, cool. So these are in this case led parts. What's that? What does it mean? Everyone knows you start out from the light source to him to diffuse objects and the GTI.

Speaker 2:          02:34          Excellent.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Now, indirect illumination is all around us, everywhere, both in the real world and both in the better computer games out there, which have the approximations of indirect elimination. And you can see that on the left image it almost looks like Photoshop. It is completely

Speaker 2:          03:00          okay

Speaker 1:          03:01          alien from its surroundings. It is almost as if he didn't take into consideration in surroundings. They are standing in the front, in the middle of the desert, not just somewhere. You would have to have some color bleeding effect that you get from your son and this is what usually the problem is with many of the fall shop delicious. You just reviled the person from somewhere and you put it in a photograph and it looks super fake and yes, mostly because of the illumination conditions. But even if you try to account for that, even if you tried to recall to have more at the same color scheme than than the rest of the photograph, you're still missing the interactive combination effect and the human values very keen in recognizing them. So you recognize that something is wrong but you don't know what exactly is missing. And it's usually indirect illumination, but there's something else. Let's take a look at this scene with recursive ray tracing. So we have refractive materials. For instance, this plastic sphere on the left of your spirit in the middle and they're completely and a diffuse sphere under right. Let's take a look at how the very same scene looks like.

Speaker 2:          04:14          What would the domination,

Speaker 1:          04:17          this is the difference one more time because the freight tracing

Speaker 2:          04:24          and global illumination,

Speaker 1:          04:26          so like we have talked about this before, I can see that differences in interactive elimination. So on the on the upper left I can see that some of the rent collar is bleeding on to the other wall and the very same with the green wall in the background. Also with case diffuse balls. So even the simple diffuse sphere looks much more interesting and much more beautiful

Speaker 2:          04:51          with global illumination.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Don't say anything, but I say something else. I see something else as well. Not only indirect elimination. I see some other effect on this image that I couldn't compute with ray phrase search before. Don't say anything. Raise your hand if you know what I'm talking about. Excellent hours that we want and what don't say anything. Okay. All right. I'm talking about this and this. So this interesting light effects on the wall and being oldest, the glass sphere. So raise your hand again if you know what, what, what this is exactly. Okay. Don't say anything because so many people know you will have to say all of you at the same time after three. Got It. Okay. So everyone, one, two, three. What is this? This motion?

Speaker 2:          05:54          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Okay. What are any other guesses?

Speaker 2:          06:01          Infection.

Speaker 1:          06:02          That's technically your fraction. Yes, but that's not how we call the offense. Anyone else?

Speaker 2:          06:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Okay. This is what we call costings. So what, what kind of life path is this? This is an interesting life path in this case. This is l s. S, t, e. Y. Because we started out from the light source, we hit the glass sphere from the outside. Then we have refraction, we he did from the inside and then we hit some diffuse object that is either this checkerboard down there or the red wall on the left and down to the eye. And if we have this effect down, we are going to have costings. It's the beautiful, beautiful phenomenon in nature.

Speaker 2:          06:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:46          That we can find the account for and it's,

Speaker 2:          06:49          hmm.

Speaker 1:          06:50          And then you can, you can see this at many, many places.

Speaker 2:          06:55          No.

Speaker 1:          06:57          Let's take a look at another example. This is the famous school corridor example from Luxor under. Okay. We have requested rate tracing and global illumination. So you can see lots of indirect illumination. This, this reddish light

Speaker 2:          07:14          on [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:16          the floor and perhaps some costings or at least caustic looking thing in front of the lockers.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Yeah. So next question. What is the definition of shadows again? So what we have said before that shadows are regions that are not visible from the light source. Now, an alternative definition of shadows is the absence of light. This is what definition we will using global illumination. So there is, you could say that there's no such thing as shadows. There's no, uh, but that's, that's not something, that's just the sense of something else. If there is less light somewhere, then there's going to be shadows. So this is the definition of Cheryl's in local illumination and the enzyme culture.

Speaker 1:          08:05          And take a look at this image. We can see some beautiful, beautiful, soft shadows. And the thing is that you don't even need to do anything to compete DC illumination. So if I have a ray tracer, what do I do? I shoot out shadow raised from these regions and I tried to approximate what regions of the light source are visible from this point in global illumination. You don't need to do anything. You just solve this equation and outcomes. Physical reality and shadows are parts of physical reality. You don't need to do anything in order to obtain shadows. It's not like a bottom up approach like ray tracing. So you, you start from a baseline and you add more and more hacks to account for more and more effects. And for global illumination you will see that we will have a simple algorithm.

Speaker 2:          08:52          Hm?

Speaker 1:          08:53          Jeff can give you all this and you don't need to account for shadows and costings and all of these things. Another beautiful example of costings. This is caustics from the point light source because for instance, you can take a look at the shadow. The shadows are hard. So it's likely to be a small or a light source. And the costings are very sharp. So they have the same behavior to large light sources as shadows and another beauty with costings. Okay, so let's assess what these recursive, very tracers that are capable of doing and what they can as well. Obviously they cannot compute, interacted with Aisha in their activation means to diffuse bounces or possibly more this you cannot compute. Correct. We'll talk about

Speaker 2:          09:50          why

Speaker 1:          09:52          and when you cannot compute costings. Well, costings, I have written in the future scenes ago that it was l s s e, so to specular PolicyCenter diffuse because you have to go through the glass ball and here I'm writing something completely different. I just say one specular balance is necessary. The rest are optional. Is this true or how can we verify this is cute.

Speaker 2:          10:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:25          In order to find out if this is true or not, I don't even need to say a word. I can just do this. You see the cost savings, swollen costs in spot. Yeah. You too. See Ya.

Speaker 2:          10:49          Yes. Excellent.

Speaker 1:          10:51          [inaudible] no steal. Gets my, it's my wedding ring. Might be my fiance is going to kill me. Okay. You have to have seen it. Yep. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Nice

Speaker 1:          11:14          in uniform.

Speaker 2:          11:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:25          Okay, so apparently rings have cost X. Well, I start off from the light source. I think one specular object. One, we're like object, and then a diffuse, which is the table. And then Deanna and I have coffee. So [inaudible] is enough for costs. There's no need to prove it in any other way. Just take a look at physical reality and let it be your crutch. Always.
