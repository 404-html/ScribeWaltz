1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.430
And of course if we have some super long light paths that are combinations of

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.600
these that obviously the rate face or the recursive ray tracer cannot take this

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.350
into account.
Why is that?
That's the big question.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.200
Let's go back to the elimination equation and imagined that I do think the

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.840
diffuse surface,
what do I do?
I try to emphasize this earlier,

6
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.841
but I will emphasize again that I take the perfect reflection direction.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.350
It doesn't matter if it's diffused or specular.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.460
I take the perfect reflection direction.
Well,
if I do this,

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
I have no idea about the surrounding soft,
the object.

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
I have no idea what is.
For instance,
the buff,
this diffuse pain.

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.440
If there is some red object,
I don't,

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.220
I don't shoot the rate there in order to get some indirect illumination,

13
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:54.210
so I will have no idea about the surroundings of this object.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.180
No.
If I switched to global illumination,
however,

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.240
there is this integration and integral part of the integration is the income,

16
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.150
the income ingredients and how I can integrate this over the hemisphere is

17
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:15.250
basically sending samples out in every direction in this hemisphere love.

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.400
If I do this,
then I will know about the surroundings of the object.

19
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:24.401
If there's a red wall or a red object in nearby or the desert nearby,

20
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.620
then I will have samples of the incoming light and therefore it will appear in

21
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.470
the color of the object.
This is fundamental.

22
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.680
This is the very important way to understand why ray tracers are missing these

23
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.650
effects.
Now let's talk about the real deal.

24
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.640
The real physically based BRDF models.

25
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.380
How does it diffuse?
I feel like it looks like this.

26
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.240
So Fr is the BRDF Omega,

27
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.730
Omega prime or incoming and outgoing directions.

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.820
X is important on this object

29
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.030
and these are probabilities.

30
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.900
Now this is weird because I'm used to formulate,

31
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.560
so if I talk about this,
you've shinning,
I just seen l.
Dot.
That does,

32
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.270
that's a formula with variables and this.
This is a freaking number.

33
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:22.990
What do I do with this number?
It's one of our pie block.

34
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Does this even make sense?
Can someone help me out with this?

35
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.140
[inaudible] so this one of our high needs that if this is a scalar,

36
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:38.410
it is probably to distribution is a scaler.

37
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.350
Remember that this is the distribution of the possible outgoing direction.

38
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.130
So imagine this

39
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.840
scenario up here or you have an incoming direction and if I have a completely

40
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:53.500
diffused material,

41
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:57.760
it means that it will diffuse the incoming light in every direction.

42
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.090
So all outgoing directions on the hemisphere have the very same probability and

43
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.770
if they have the very same probability,

44
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
then this should be a number than the whole BRDF Cynthia number because whatever

45
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.990
directions I specify here,
I will get the same problem

46
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.920
and I can scale this one over.
Pie with a role which is the IRB Gulf,

47
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:26.090
the material,
because not a little materials reflect all lights.

48
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.180
In fact most or if not all of the materials we know absorbed some amount of

49
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.803
<v 1>light.</v>

50
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.660
<v 0>So this is again a number.</v>

51
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.030
This can be way of like dependent because it depends how much you have sort on

52
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:44.010
the rep channel,
how much or new channel.

53
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.760
But this can be potentially zero and then you have a black body,

54
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.670
something that absorbs everything so you can call it that you can,

55
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.870
you can change the color of the object.

56
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.070
If I'm not using the right term specs,
I'd like to remain intuitive.

57
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.010
So the Obo is going to give it a color of the object

58
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.230
this weekend specifying no.
Zero.
Okay.
The next question is,

59
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:12.250
is this a probability distribution function?
Of course it is.
Why?

60
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.200
Because it's because it integrates to what?

61
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.610
There are some other rules that we're going to disregard with respect to

62
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.410
property to distribution functions,

63
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.250
how much does it integrate into this interface?
To what?
Why?

64
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.210
What does the engineer guys say?
Well,
one of our pie integrated from zero to Pi.

65
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:32.350
What does it mean?
I have a rectangle that is,

66
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.380
that has the heights of one over pipe and it has the width of Pie.

67
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.640
What is the area of direct title?
Let's multiply these two sides.

68
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.650
So it's eight times via is Pi these one over Phi,

69
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:49.570
just multiply by two and do get one.
So this is indeed

70
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.770
a problem into distribution function.
Good to go.

71
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.530
What about specular brds.

72
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.860
He says these are what describe mirrors.

73
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.073
<v 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.980
<v 0>how can I write such a BRDF?</v>

75
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.430
It's a bit trickier because it is fundamentally different than just diffuse

76
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.350
materials.
Why they don't diffuse incoming lighting.

77
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.890
All possible actions.
What?

78
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.640
What is possible is only one outgoing direction.

79
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.800
I see only one thing in the mirror,

80
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.650
not the mixture of everything like on the walls.

81
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.100
<v 1>Okay,</v>

82
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.710
<v 0>so this means that one outgoing direction is going to have a,</v>

83
00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:35.340
probably do have one and every single other choices have a zero probability.

84
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.060
So this is indeed a probabilistic model that can be described by a delta

85
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:40.894
distribution.

86
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.790
That's a distribution means that one guy has a problem to deal with one and

87
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.050
everyone else says zero.
So it's like and actions in a dictatorship.

88
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.830
Is this a problem?
Is the distribution function?
It is,

89
00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:01.670
but I put an asterisk there because I'm going to talk a bit more about this,

90
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.481
but let's,

91
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.481
let's say for now that it is because is this is one for one incoming direction

92
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.410
and zero everyone else.
So we have the wonderful

93
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.313
<v 1>you're looking for</v>

94
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.560
<v 0>and there are also glossy.
The rds,</v>

95
00:06:16.561 --> 00:06:21.561
we haven't been really talking about this in the first lecture of mine that it

96
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.930
was some BRDF which was called spreads on one of these images.

97
00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:26.650
But I asked you to forgets his term.

98
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:31.110
He needed the glossy is the mixture of the two.

99
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.620
So it is not like a mirror but it's not like a completely diffuse materials.

100
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.900
So there is some view dependents in the feels materials.

101
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.100
The APP completely independent bureaus are completely dependent.

102
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.350
So it's like a mixture of the two.

103
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.550
It is possible that there are some loss in materials in this scene.

104
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.023
Can you find them?

105
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

106
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.490
<v 0>Raise your hand if you see at least one.</v>

107
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.923
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

108
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.580
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
yes,</v>

109
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.240
a couple of the cupboard.
Excellent.
Yes.
Anything else?

110
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.040
Just Charlotte.
Me?

111
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.563
Yes.

112
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.680
You mean this?
Oh,
the floor.
But the cooking,
the cooking Fieldglass slow.

113
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.190
Those little,
oh yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
That's awesome.
Awesome.

114
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.340
So there is Spanish samples that I think the question would be what is math

115
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:41.650
philosophy in this scene?
The better this will be,
the better question.

116
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.710
And the people you are sitting here is also flossing.

117
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.750
It is a bit fuel dependent,
but it's modern era but it's not completely diffused.

118
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.870
And it also transfers the costings.

119
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.220
So it has some diffusivity.
Okay.

120
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.390
Next question is if it looks good,
but the mathematician guy asks,

121
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:08.210
how accurate is this?
Oh,

122
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.780
we have this two images.

123
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.180
One of these is generated by means of global illumination solving this equation

124
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:16.530
and the other one is a photograph.

125
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.150
Do you know which is which?
Raise your hand if so.

126
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.560
Okay,
one person.

127
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.120
Okay,
I'm going to,
I'm going to spoil all the [inaudible].

128
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.230
Okay,
so look at this part.

129
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.770
So this is the difference that you can see for instance,

130
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.720
because they is the actual box that that's the guys put together at the Cornell

131
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.020
University and you cannot only see the box in the photograph,

132
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.610
but what is next to the box.
Whereas in global illumination,

133
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:11.430
the surroundings and not model just the Cornell box itself.

134
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:13.950
So we can go blue eyes.
Yes,

135
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.920
this can be distinguished from a photograph,

136
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:21.360
but if you look at the actual scene,
it is very,

137
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.493
<v 1>yeah.</v>

138
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.190
<v 0>And if everything is perfectly implemented,</v>

139
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.870
then this is so close to physical reality that it is literally

140
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.680
indistinguishable.
So this is really amazing that we can do this.

141
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.720
Whatever you see out there in the world,
we come up with this equation.

142
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.200
There are exceptions because there are wave effects such as diffraction and

143
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.880
stuff like that,
but these are very rare.

144
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.940
I mean there are butterflies looked away because of interference and then these

145
00:09:58.421 --> 00:09:58.811
effects.

146
00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:03.811
But 99% of what you see can be model did this equation and the rest can be

147
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.060
having more sophisticated methods.

148
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.300
So back to this period question,

149
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:12.850
what is the dimensionality of the rendering of equation?

150
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.703
<v 1>Okay,</v>

151
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.710
<v 0>let's try to think it through and it will see so less for just for now.</v>

152
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:25.050
Imagine that I should rape out from the cabinet and I hit the diffuse object.

153
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.800
I need to sample this hemisphere exhaustedly this is not how I will evaluate the

154
00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:35.110
algorithm,
but technically this is what I need to do.

155
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.950
All possible outcome directions have the same probability.

156
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.370
So I need to shoot these outgoing raise,
many of them.

157
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.180
Now I will hit more diffuse objects after the first bounce and I have to

158
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:51.970
exhausting this sample.
All of these as well.

159
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.360
<v 0>And if I take this other way,
I also have to do this and so on and so on.</v>

161
00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:01.840
And so until holiday balances,

162
00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:06.841
we have concluded previously that we have to take into consideration and

163
00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:08.440
infinite number of boxes.

164
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.610
So this is definitely very difficult because the incoming light that I am

165
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.730
something the hemisphere for is another good question.

166
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.250
So imagine that this tell hi,

167
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.340
you can insert another one of these equations,

168
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.550
but that equation will also contain this and this.

169
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.120
And that's a matter of rendering equation.
So it's,

170
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:36.690
it's an infinitely large sequence of the nipples.

171
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.810
Therefore this is easily a dementia.

172
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.830
Now I've told you before that this is also singular.

173
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.560
This is not such a bad thing,

174
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:55.350
but this is because of the of specular brds.

175
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.590
The specular BRDF is some kind of the data distribution and Delta distributions

176
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.080
are not really functions.
So in,
in,
in signal processing,

177
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.100
you may have studied this and the first thing that they tell you about this that

178
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.630
this is not a function.
This can be defined in terms of the limit.

179
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.520
So you can for instance,

180
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.120
imagine like a Gaussian curve and you start pushing his Garcia Clara from two

181
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:30.140
sides.
Therefore this is going to be a larger and larger and thing are getting

182
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.260
response.
Would you do this until you have an infinitive things?

183
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:39.290
Right now if you check it for the properties of a function,

184
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.810
you will get something that has nothing to do with the function that's,

185
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.860
that's a singularity.

186
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.330
There's an infinitely quick channel from zero to one in there and we need to

187
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.360
handle this somehow because we can,
we can take into consideration functions.

188
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:56.800
We can integrate phantoms.

189
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
So let's just solve this trivially by handling this specular reflection and

190
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:05.680
specifically what does it mean?

191
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.020
This means that if you have an incoming direction,

192
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.180
you're not going to play with probabilities.

193
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.100
You are just going to grab like in a ray tracer,
you are just going to grab

194
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.640
the perfect reflection of direction as allowed contraction,
no probabilities.

195
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.653
<v 1>Wow.</v>

196
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.240
<v 0>The beauty break,</v>

197
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.230
we have some scenario which is ray tracing because of different things,

198
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.720
because the image you created by means afraid facing,

199
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:39.550
but there's literally one ray of light being reflected here many times.

200
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.970
So awesome.
These are experiments with lux render.

201
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.800
We will try and things off like this.
A big layer of during in the course

202
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.900
and the lottery example.
It's amazing what we can do with these aggregators.

203
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
