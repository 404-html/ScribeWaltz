00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.970
Okay,
philosophical question,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.260
what is the definition of shadows and because Ron along,

3
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:12.190
so it was all people already,
even for an hour,
uh,
us,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.170
let's for now,
but only for now.
They can.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.190
Shadows are niches that are not visible from light sources.
And again,

6
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:24.780
if you're a how transport or if you're bored with an extra such as this one,

7
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.700
but hopefully not this one and well you can take a look at the chateau and

8
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:29.760
regions and you will,

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.480
you will immediately recognize that these are the regions that are somehow

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
included,
which respect to the light source.
Let's take a look at an example.

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.460
This small red dot on the top.
This is

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.723
a light source.

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.730
This is a point of light source and this black thing is a sphere.

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.170
And behind that,
what would respect to the light source?
We have an umbrella.

15
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.120
This is a completely shadowed region.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.640
This is the name of the completely shadowed region.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.170
And if we are able to shape these points in the ray tracer,

18
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.550
and if I want shadows,

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.120
then I need to compute whether this way when I'm shading the point is obstructed

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.810
or occluded from the light source or not.

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
But this is very simple to do.
So imagine that.

22
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.080
I would like to shake this point below on the plane and what I will do is I

23
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.480
would sand or a that I call a shadow rate towards the light source was

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.180
interested in is is it obstruct?

25
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.420
Obstructed means that it hits something before it's blocked by something.

26
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
So the first question is,
is an incredibly difficult question.

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.220
Is this whole structured or not?

28
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
It is indeed.
Okay,
what about this guy?

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.520
This is obstructed as well.
Okay.
What about these guys?

30
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.380
These guys are good.
Okay,
cool.

31
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.420
So it is for now the very simple concept shadows.

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.610
It means that I also have a visibility signal that I wanted by the intensity

33
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.400
with,
and this is finally,

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.490
obviously the rain either hits an object or it doesn't.
That's it.

35
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.550
Very simple.
This intensity that is not radiums,

36
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.100
but this is the hack that we use in ray tracing.

37
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.810
This is the simpler version of things.
Still,
I'm going to set to Ciro,

38
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:34.830
whatever showed you.
They have at that point,
I don't care.
It is in shadows.

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.730
It's going to be completely black.
So this is the simple version.

40
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.490
What about real life?
Well,
in real life,

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.550
probably cloud services don't exist because the point by mathematical definition

42
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.360
is off measures zero.

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600
It means that it's infinitely small and something that is infinitely small.

44
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.040
Well,
we call it a light source so that this is something that has infinite is,

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.240
but it has given amount of energy.
Why don't you go ask Stephen Hawking?

46
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.880
He would say that this is the definition of a black hole.

47
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.990
So we were terrible at court and if this would happen,

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.770
we would have much bigger problems than computing shadow raise.

49
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.020
So that's definitely out of our interest at the moment.

50
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.260
So we haven't had a light source and we still have the ombre because none of the

51
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.160
rays make it to the light source.

52
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
But we have a different region that we call [inaudible],

53
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.180
which are partially shadowed regions.
So thanks.

54
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.860
I wrote to that much more interesting.

55
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.970
Now I'm going to shoot to shadow raise from the surface towards different

56
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:43.960
regions of the loud source.
What about these guys?

57
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.590
What about the right shadow rate?

58
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.993
<v 1>Good.</v>

59
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.480
<v 0>Okay.
What about the left?</v>

60
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 1>Good.</v>

61
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.620
<v 0>It's not a pollutant.
Okay,
excellent.
So this is this.</v>

62
00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:02.621
Some already doesn't seem binary anymore and this visibility signal,

63
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.880
it's going to be continuous.

64
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.910
So there may be points which are visible from some part of the light source but

65
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.680
not visible from an added part of the light source.

66
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.520
And therefore we have some kind of partial occlusion.

67
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.340
And the question is how do we compute this?

68
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.630
How can we write a program that can give me a beautiful Allin Bra and not just

69
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.750
hard shadows.
So if we only have the umbrella,
this is in the literature,

70
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.290
this is called hard shadows and Penumbra is soft shadows.

71
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.640
We're going to see examples of that in a second.

72
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.790
So very simple.

73
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.990
Let's try to approximate the era after the light source that is visible from

74
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:49.770
that point.
Whoever the whole area off the light source.

75
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.680
Let's see an example of that.

76
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:57.681
But first I'm interested in how to approximate this because I'm talking more

77
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.260
areas and this sounds like some kind of integration problem and for now we are

78
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:09.360
not going to retaliate in the gloss over it.
Yes.
For instance,

79
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:13.890
what we can do is we could shoot a lot of shadow raced and tried to approximate

80
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:17.760
this area.
So the approximation is going to be the following.

81
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:22.761
I'm interested in the physical shadow raced a number of visible shadow race over

82
00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:27.030
all the shadow race that I have computed.

83
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.740
Well example,
how was this region going to look like?

84
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.970
Well,

85
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.920
I'm going to shoot 100 shadow raise from this small black dots and I'm

86
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:42.060
interested in how many of them is going to make it to the light source.

87
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.230
What do you think?
Well,

88
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.350
uh,
out of 100 chatter race,

89
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.990
does 100 heat the line source?
Definitely not.

90
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.020
Well last 50
probably not.
Okay,

91
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.400
well it's actually,
it's quite reasonably dark there.

92
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.690
So let's say that three of them is the line source.

93
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.370
It's very simple approximation.

94
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.580
I should 100 shadow raise three of them and therefore this is what I'm going to

95
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.880
multiply this intensity that I have computed with.
Okay.

96
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.810
What about the next major?
This is a bit far,
far away.

97
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.480
Out of 100 does 100 of people hit this region?

98
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.980
Definitely not half of them but do you think first time definitely.

99
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.030
Okay,
cool.

100
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.330
And if we go even more out of the Ombre then I have this white dog and I'm

101
00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:49.200
interested in how many of these could hit the light source.

102
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.870
I think that that can be,

103
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.080
there are regions where we should meet are definitely all started but it's not

104
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:57.840
too much.

105
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.840
So let's say that 95% of the shadow is hit the light source so I can let me

106
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:08.850
compute in a way self chatters,
not only shadows but now soft shadows.

107
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.880
You're going to see examples of that and what we have done here is actually

108
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.250
Monte-carlo integration and you're going to hear a lot about Monte Carlo

109
00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:23.370
integration.
It's in every list.
I don't know,

110
00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:28.371
some teenage people look up the top 10 builder list of the best music clips off

111
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:34.760
lady Gaga and the others.
What I do myself,
I can test.

112
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.700
I do have the top 10 mathematical techniques nowadays.

113
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.120
And I tell you that Monte Carlo integration is always on the beer board topless.

114
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.510
It's one of the most effective techniques to evaluate integrals.

115
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.010
And we're going to study them extensively and it's going to make your life

116
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.020
infinitely simpler.
Not a quick question.
Yes.

117
00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:00.510
Can such an image for you physically correct.

118
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:03.030
But obviously it's a drawing so it's not correct.

119
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.360
But those something that unbelievably so incorrect that it would,

120
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.090
it would need some attention.
Who can tell me that?

121
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.683
Yes.

122
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.220
<v 0>That is true.
Unfortunately this is a mind reading exercise.</v>

124
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.830
So you would have to figure out what I have thought.

125
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.440
Just getting that's absolutely true.
But that people pick yes.

126
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.430
Pissed down.
Well,
um,
as far as I know,

127
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:47.300
physics delight should spend a little bit in roads from the object,

128
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.640
but that's not the,
the,
we are very far away from that.

129
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.780
[inaudible] you are absolutely true.
So if I say in terms of shadows,

130
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.880
wait,
I would've said something funny about the shadows from the air shuttles.

131
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.940
Indeed.
Where

132
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.150
between the object and the ground like yes.
Okay.

133
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.190
What's what's up with you?
Should

134
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.290
error wouldn't technically be shadow themselves.
Which Arrow?

135
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.640
The area of art.

136
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.950
The air part between the old chicken

137
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.103
<v 1>but it's</v>

138
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.910
<v 0>at this [inaudible] between the surface of the object is empty space,</v>

139
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.703
which is,

140
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.070
what about if I ask about this transition from here to the outside.

141
00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:47.170
So if you imagine this boss that we have,

142
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.100
if I will put it in the Umbra and I will slowly move out of there.

143
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.210
Would I experience such a jump that I see here?

144
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.670
Okay,
why not?

145
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.230
Because if I start from the Ombre,
it may be that yes,

146
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.700
I cannot construct any kind of rate that he's the light source and as I move

147
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.990
outwards it will continuously increase this probability.

148
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.370
There is not going to be a jump that you see this abrupt Connor change.

149
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.220
It is going to be a perfectly smooth gradient,

150
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.260
almost perfectly smooth gradient depending on many other physical properties.

151
00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:31.270
But this is more or less what I would say.

152
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.330
And there's going to be an example of that in a second.

153
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.430
So this is what I have said for those who are reading this at home.

154
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.150
And the question is very simple question,

155
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.600
what kind of lights are still we have on this image?

156
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.690
It's a part of dried source.
Excellent.
Why?

157
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.360
<v 1>Right?</v>

158
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.540
<v 0>Because I don't see it.
I see.
Excellent.</v>

159
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.090
So this should be a point like source and what technically you could say that if

160
00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:07.390
you have a smaller airline source but only one shadow race.

161
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.040
So you don't do this integration just on one channel,

162
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.920
you can have something similar for this.
But uh,
generally these are 0.5 sources.

163
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:16.030
What about these guys

164
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.733
<v 1>forms?</v>

165
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.480
<v 0>The left one seems to be a point.
I source the right one.</v>

166
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:28.481
I can see this beautiful continuous change and this is definitely a felony.

167
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.720
But if I take a look at this region below this object that I can also see some

168
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:39.620
kind of new bro.
So it might be that it,
this is a small on the left.

169
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.540
It's a small area,
light source that is close to the object perhaps.

170
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.310
And this is why I don't see the blueprint,

171
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.020
but other places I see it and here on the right it has a really pronounced

172
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:55.180
effect.
So is definitely an area light source.

173
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.130
<v 1>Okay,</v>

174
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.130
<v 0>well the next question is that in physical reality we usually don't see</v>

175
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.630
perfectly black shadows.

176
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.080
So if I take a look around in this room I see shadows,

177
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.110
I see their region that is in this and then some kind of raw and the Lube Raj

178
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:16.690
something.
But this is anything about perfectly,

179
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.330
yes that's true.

180
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.430
So there is an effect that we are going to talk about next lecture and it is

181
00:12:31.431 --> 00:12:36.260
called indirect illumination
and this basically we use that.

182
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

183
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.180
<v 0>In a in Vra tracing program we are only accounting for the direct effect of an</v>

184
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.023
outsource.

185
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.270
But in physical reality it is possible that did the light comes in through this

186
00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:50.040
window.
He's no more.

187
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:55.041
First is wide wall and then he's the grounds in this or Asian and then it goes

188
00:12:56.551 --> 00:13:00.950
to words Maya and therefore some of the energy is going to be big type.

189
00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:05.951
So the effect of this white wall is going to make these black or dark channels

190
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.063
lighter.

191
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.450
<v 0>And this we cannot compute yet.</v>

193
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.750
This is multiple diffuse balances after each other.

194
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.150
We cannot take this into account.

195
00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:19.580
We would need to solve the full rendering equation for this.

196
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.910
So what we have is direct illumination and this is why the MBM term comes into

197
00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:26.270
place.

198
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.080
What we have been talking about this ambulance term is just basically adding

199
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:33.290
something to this intensity that I have.
Why?

200
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.710
Because this was the image of it.

201
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:40.310
So I would have perfectly black shadows and for instance,

202
00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:45.311
for this classroom I would have an ambient intensity that is a collar that has

203
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.420
greatly and therefore these regions will not be perfectly black,

204
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:51.740
but I would add the sticks,

205
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.750
great numbers and therefore it would be a bit more grip.
So this is a happy,

206
00:13:56.751 --> 00:14:00.710
this is a really crude approximation of indirect elimination,

207
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.080
but it more or less works.

208
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:08.170
At least it is an accepted way to cheat back this last energy in a ray tracer.

209
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.190
Yes.
For the,
um,
um,
um,

210
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.050
multicultural techniques casita shed the race.
Uh,
how we,

211
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:24.110
how do we determine where at the surface of the night where you're shooting the

212
00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:29.540
points because there's a surface or do we pick some random points on the

213
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:30.374
surface?

214
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.590
These are difficult details of ray tracing programs.

215
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.260
There are techniques that help you to pick a uniformly,

216
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.690
uh,
chosen random direction on a sphere for instance,

217
00:14:44.691 --> 00:14:48.710
that I would shoot or uniform directions or points.

218
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.870
So I choose a random point on a,

219
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.320
and I'm going to connect this to that other point.

220
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.880
And so perfectly uniformly chosen random points.

221
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.620
This I need to generate on the surface of the light source and this I would need

222
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:04.454
to sample.

223
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.640
And there's also organizations for that because what if a life force has a

224
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.720
nonuniform radiation?

225
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.740
So some light sources are be times in one direction but not in others.

226
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.060
How do I account for that?
And there's even optimization techniques for that.

227
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.170
And then the short beauty break,
while

228
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.550
we like plugs around there a lot and,

229
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.530
but they see us that apparently some nerds are living their dreams in our

230
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:37.370
program and creating people like that.

231
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.380
There is lots of programs that help you achieving these realistic things.

232
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:42.740
And,

233
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.740
and later on we will talk a bit about how skin realistic skin can be achieved,

234
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.360
such as the one that you can see here.

235
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.850
It kind of skin is not a surface.
Skin is a volume.

236
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.770
So not everyone knows,

237
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.830
but some amount of the light is penetrating the surface of the skin and it goes

238
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:04.784
beneath.

239
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.590
It gets scared and absorbed maybe even a thousand times there.

240
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.230
And it may come out somebody else from your skin.
And this is why the,

241
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.460
there are computer games in the older computer games.

242
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:21.200
This is why humans look really fake and plastic because they don't account for

243
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:22.034
this effect.

244
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.720
And the nurse computer games can compute this or something like this in real

245
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:29.000
time.
And this is what makes them so beautiful.
