1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.710
That is still one thing that we don't know and it's about angles.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.040
So we know about probably it is whatever you give me,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.690
I can't tell you what is the probability that light gets reflected or refracted.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.880
I know the problem is,
but I don't know about angles and what we need to know.

5
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.470
Just that light rays of light slow down.
They travel with the speed of light,

6
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:27.471
but they slow down as they enter immediately because there is a Adam's particles

7
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.320
in there and it's more difficult to get through.
So let's slow stuff.

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.220
The index of refraction tells you by exactly how much.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.740
So the index of refraction of the medium is given by this fraction,

10
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.210
the speed of light in vacuum.
That will go over the speed of light in this media.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.190
So,
uh,
this is how we can write it up.
Let's look at an example.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.580
The index of refraction of class is 1.5 so we know exactly what the speed of

13
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.370
light inside glass is.
Well,

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.840
it's a 300 million meters per second in vacuum.

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.100
And what we know is this equation.
So this is the next of reflection.

16
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.920
So I can adjust,

17
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.590
reorder this pink and conclude that a light,

18
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.000
if it travels in vacuum 200,

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.020
300 million meters per second,

20
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
but in glass it moves is the third of its velocity and it's only 200 million

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.340
meters per second.
So let's,

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.010
that's a pretty easy calculation and it's pretty neat.

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.920
And another absolutely beautiful thing.

24
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.210
Hopefully you have studied the Maxwell equations and pointing vectors in
physics.

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.790
Uh,
light is ultimately a wave.

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
So here above and below you can see some wave behavior and the rig is

27
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.510
essentially the wave front of these waves.

28
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.610
So light can be imagined as race.
If you,
uh,

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
take into consideration that I would need to compute many of these wave fronts

30
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.920
in order to take account for the way behavior.

31
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.240
And don't look at the rent only.
Look at the blue.
Uh,

32
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.250
this is above,
this is a vacuum.
And below this could be for instance,
class.

33
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.900
And you can see that the waves slow down in this meeting.
And,

34
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.050
uh,
what this means,
if we go back to the definition of the way from Stern,

35
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.170
the red lines,

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.100
that they are essentially bending because the wave fronts are going to look like

37
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:27.920
this.
So it's,

38
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.970
it's very interesting because if you imagine light as a wave,
it only slows down.

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.600
But if you imagine life as a re then events,

40
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.070
it changes direction.
So,
uh,

41
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.780
I think that's absolutely beautiful.

42
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.660
And the question is,
uh,

43
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440
why is the light refracting inwards?

44
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.540
Because what I would imagine is that it continues normally continue with its

45
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.370
way.
Uh,
this T.
Dot.

46
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:05.371
T equals p I because if we just continue its way and it doesn't continue it's

47
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.780
way,
but it the fence and the question is why.

48
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.130
And now we have cal academy time.

49
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.630
Raise your hand if you know Ken Academy.
Okay.
Awesome.
Awesome.

50
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.220
Well educated people.

51
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.850
So this is shamelessly stolen from cal academy because this is the best way to

52
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.170
describe how reflection works.
So basically,
uh,
you,

53
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.180
can you imagine that you have a large car and the air vacuum interface is now

54
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.580
road.
And what

55
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.040
I mean the road is the air and Matt is glass for instance.

56
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.650
And imagine as you are approaching this,

57
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.240
this boundary line between the two than the first wheel of the car.

58
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.270
Like the lower left on this image is entering the market but the other,

59
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.980
but on the other side,
the wheels are still on the road.

60
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.340
So therefore this wheel was slow down in the mud.

61
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.280
But this is still going as fast as it used to be.

62
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.820
So what will the car do if this happens?

63
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.950
It was starting to turn and you know exactly when it would turn because this is

64
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.030
going slowly,
this is going faster.
So therefore it would turn inwards.

65
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.800
So this is I think an amazing interpretation,
lockable thing.

66
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.670
It's easy to explain who the ways,

67
00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:30.170
because we've been the ways to slow down in the direction.

68
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.010
Then we can see that the circles are good to be here.

69
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.550
And then if you go out to the [inaudible],

70
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.070
then we will go exactly like,
like in the previous figure.
That's,

71
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.190
that's another intuition that she's going to ask if this is actually physically

72
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.300
happens because I don't think so.
No,
this is intuition.

73
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.560
That's why it's a bit,
if it's a good receding and then the,
it's a nice,

74
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.720
this is strictly an indication.
Okay.
So if you would,

75
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.150
if you would start to model a raise of lights,
uh,

76
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.110
like trucks on going [inaudible] they're going to encounter problems.

77
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.440
This part of the wave hits the media first.

78
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:11.640
Pens by the entire weight gets rotated.

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.990
[inaudible]
no,
it,

80
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.760
the,
I attempt to give multiple ways to interpret things because,
you know,

81
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:24.210
different minds work differently,
son.

82
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.560
Graphical ways are working for different people better.
Okay.

83
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.280
So Status Law and uh,
we're almost done for today.

84
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.660
Style slaw tells cob and what angle refracted raised or can you continue their

85
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:41.770
path?
And this is given by this expression,
science of the angles,

86
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.880
uh,
against velocities against that recipe.

87
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.050
Reciprocity call of innocence of refraction.
Okay.

88
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.010
So let's do the air class example of the previous image.

89
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.070
Let's say our expectations before we go.

90
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.690
So I'm interested in the relation of Fida I versus the 30.

91
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.520
So,
uh,

92
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.550
I know these expressions exactly how much you feed in degrees C is 60.

93
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.610
Okay,
excellent.
How much speed decrease?

94
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.210
Yes.
It's,
it's something around 35.
Exactly.
Okay.

95
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.250
So the light is reflected in words,

96
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.630
therefore the fida t must be less than the fee.

97
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.220
So this must be,
yes,
yes.

98
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.590
Let's compute the equation and see if this works.
And if it doesn't work,

99
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.670
we're going to call out the physicists.
So let's just,

100
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:44.130
we are there some things and let's put there the indices of refractions,
uh,

101
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.250
and the incoming light angle that we know and just some very simple reordering.

102
00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:52.960
We are almost there.

103
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.740
And if we actually compute the side of 60 degrees,
we get this.
Well,

104
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.780
this is all we can also,
uh,
carry out the division.

105
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.440
But at this point,
I'm not interested in the sign of the 30.

106
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:09.940
I'm interested in feedback tea.

107
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.160
So I would multiply both sides in vertical Asian by multiplying with the inverse

108
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:19.070
of the side.
So this data,
you should be,
uh,

109
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.710
the rx sign of this.
And if I compute everything back to the degrees,

110
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.330
then I will get this theater thing,
which is 34 point 75.

111
00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:29.530
So we're sat,

112
00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:33.760
the 35 was very close to the actual result.

113
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.680
But also not to forget that there's different kinds of glasses.
I mean,
uh,

114
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.980
there's,

115
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.980
there's multiple ways of creating and manufacturing glasses and they have

116
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:48.370
different diseases of reflection,
more or less the same,
but it's still different.

117
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.990
But we can see that this is,

118
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:54.190
this isn't in your really good agreement with what we see in your life.

119
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.110
Well,
what did we say?
Theda t should be less than DTI,

120
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.190
but 35 is definitely less than six days.
So again,

121
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.120
physics works and physicists are a smart people.

122
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.680
And,
uh,
Justin,
matter example,

123
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.780
if you think about the car example or whichever example you like better,

124
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.160
you mean,
uh,

125
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.190
hopefully immediately see that if we would be going with the Yellow Arrow,

126
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.590
this is going to bend inwards after going back from the water to the air.

127
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.680
<v 1>Nah.
Whoa.
Hold it right there.</v>

128
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.830
Uh,
what is happening?

129
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.410
<v 0>I don't see any reflection whatsoever.</v>

130
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.503
Right.

131
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.920
But it seems to me that if I go back at around how much is this in degrees

132
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

133
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.410
<v 0>that seems to decrease.
Exactly.
So something fishy happens that's 50 degrees.</v>

134
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.210
Well,
I don't know what is happening.

135
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.250
I'll tell you the name and we are going to compute better.

136
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:10.260
This is possible or not.
Well,

137
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.960
if it's not possible that our math sucks.
So,
uh,
let's see.

138
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.160
So what we,
uh,
what we call this is total internal reflection.

139
00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:23.510
There is a critical angle and after this critical angle,

140
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.360
there is no more a refraction.
There's only,

141
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.320
there is no more a refraction only reflection happens.

142
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.970
And there is many examples of that and there's many applications of that.
Uh,

143
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.830
this is one of the more beautiful examples.
So let's go get what's,

144
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:40.970
what's going on here.

145
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.750
And what I know is that I have the innocence of refractions.
I know,

146
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.180
I know this big,
this degree,
uh,
that we,
uh,

147
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:54.060
just dealt with and something interesting should happen here.
Uh,

148
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.060
and something interesting already happened.

149
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.450
So I just plugged in everything what I have seen on the savage and I get this

150
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.130
and this is awfully,
horribly,
terribly wrong.

151
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.720
Someone please help me out.
Why is that

152
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.370
okay?
Yes.
Fine.
Can't be bigger than one.
Exactly.

153
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.000
So the support of the sinus between one and minus one,

154
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.310
at least according to my experiences.

155
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.880
So it's saying that the side of an angle is more than one is mathematical enough

156
00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:39.350
possible.
So it says that there is no such angle.

157
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.250
What will be the angle of refraction?
If I would use using 50 degrees,

158
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.580
then it says something that mathematically it doesn't make any sense.

159
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.170
So math actually suggests to you if you use the right numbers,

160
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.610
it suggests to you already that this total internal reflection would happen.

161
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.910
Uh,
let's try to compute the critical I book.

162
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.910
And this I just reordered things.

163
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.890
This is hopefully the critical angle that I will be trying to compete.

164
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.230
Well,
if I have this deeper,
I one,
this is a relatively small number.

165
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.880
Diary is going to be refraction.

166
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.740
There is this critical angle on the second figure at which I have this 90

167
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:25.010
degree,
uh,
refraction.
So it sat at the critical angle.

168
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.970
This thing is going to be 90 degrees and after that,

169
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.820
so this is smaller than this,

170
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.150
after this critical angle is only going to be reflection.

171
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.160
Now lets try to compute this a note,

172
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.770
a lotus that 90 degrees here.

173
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.950
So what I put here is this is what I'm interested in and this happens when this

174
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:52.160
refraction is at 90 degrees.

175
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.400
So I put to sign to degrees specifically and I want to know this feedback that's

176
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.920
going to be that.
That's going to be into a

177
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.860
critical angle.
What if I actually uh,

178
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.060
do the computation with the 90 degrees that I'm going to get one for the
science.

179
00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:14.980
So this is n two over and long.
What?

180
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.510
I'm still not interested in the sign of this angle,
I'm interested in the handle.

181
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.020
So I have to invert the other side,
both sides of the equation.

182
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.860
And this is the definition of the critical angle.

183
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.130
And if you write it in Wikipedia critical,

184
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.770
again you are going to get the very same formula.

185
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.300
But the most interesting thing is that you can actually derive this yourself.

186
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.600
And this is not a huge deprivation.
This is very simple.

187
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.960
This is where this 90 degree refraction happens.

188
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.340
So what is our expectation for this critical angle?

189
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.380
Let's look at the reality again.

190
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.700
Watch.
So this is,

191
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.250
I'm just trying to hint without saying,
telling you the solution.

192
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:06.970
So let's try it without hints.
Uh,
what,

193
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.450
what could be the critical angle here?
Raise your hand if you know the answer.

194
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.040
Okay.
Sorry.
I will.
For pedagogical reason.

195
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.970
I'm going to ask someone who hasn't asked before that.

196
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.850
Let's see if it's correct.
I haven't asked you.
I asked you before.
Nothing.

197
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.890
Nothing important.
Okay.

198
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.200
You have an important question in smaller than 50 degrees.

199
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.373
Exactly.

200
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.000
So the usual answer I get is that 50 degrees,

201
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.940
because I see a totally internal reflection,

202
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.610
but total internal reflection means that after sun,

203
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.920
at some point after that is moving into the reflection.

204
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.280
So it doesn't mean that if it doesn't mean that this is at point,

205
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.150
because if I will be trying 60 degrees,
I will also see reflection.

206
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.610
But this doesn't mean that 60 degrees is the critical angle.
It's before that,

207
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.470
that sample.
Okay.
Well there's your answer to.

208
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.360
Okay.
Was this your answer as well?

209
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.100
Just always thinking that if it's,
if it's critical,
then you,

210
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:24.581
for example,

211
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:29.581
is the 50th grouping also reflection and then of horizontal one.

212
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.110
Exactly.
Yes.
What you have seen on the figure.
So at the critical angle,

213
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.380
you'll see this
instead of this.

214
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.760
So this is over the critical level,
so it has to be less than 50 degrees,

215
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.920
less than six and 50 degrees.
Okay?
So this is very simple from here.

216
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.170
That's just substituting.
This is off the fraction.

217
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.770
41 point 81 wonderful physics works and we are still alive.

218
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.820
So that's basically it for today.
Uh,

219
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.510
we have used reality to be our judge.

220
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:10.540
We are not just writing formula on paper and then be happy about how much we can

221
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.850
understand or how much we can memorize all of them.

222
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.060
We put everything to use and you will see all of this in c plus plus code not so

223
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.320
long from now.

224
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.530
So that would be the introductory course and a see you next week.

225
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.500
Thank you.
