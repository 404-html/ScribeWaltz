WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.610
Now there is another fundamental question which is,
uh,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.590
what makes the difference between different materials.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
And the,
the other question is how do we model well,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.900
different materials reflecting,
coming,
right,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.460
two different directions and they absorb different amounts of it in different

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.930
waivers.
Uh,
that's the answer we are,
we are going to talk a lot about this,

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.700
but this is an example.
These are different material.
So the specular,

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.331
uh,

9
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.930
in the specular case there is one incoming direction and there is one possible

10
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.130
outcome in direction.
That's it.
This is what always happened.

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
This is for instance,
a mirror because I see exactly the reflection of myself.

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
There's,
there's no,
no other thing that I see in the mirror.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.410
But for a diffuse surface,
for one incoming direction,

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.310
there's many possible outcomes in many possible directions.

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.680
And this gives a diffuse surface.

16
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.450
We are going to see examples of depth and it writes,
it writes spread.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.950
Please forget this term.

18
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.710
Let's call this whole single step because this is what it is.

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.510
This is like the mixture of these two.

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.430
So these are some basic material models that we are going to see in our

21
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:15.750
renderers later on.
Uh,
now to formalize this in a way,

22
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
let's create a function that's a probability density function with three

23
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.030
parameters.
So this is a three dimensional function.
Uh,

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.780
one variable is the incoming light direction.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.690
The other variable is a point on the surface.

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.720
And what I'm interested in is how much light is flowing out from this point in

27
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:40.230
different directions.
Now,
uh,

28
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.090
a bit more formalized this Fr is going to be disruption.

29
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
I'm interested in the income and direction and the point in space.
This is,

30
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.990
this too,
is what I have and I will be interested in the outgoing directions.

31
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.630
What is the probability of different outcomes,
directions,

32
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.980
and this is how we will,
how we will write it formally.

33
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.690
Omega is an incoming direction.
Direction x is a point in space that we choose.

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.030
And Omega prime is the outgoing direction.

35
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.630
And this we call the BRDF for,
uh,

36
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.280
bi-directional reflectors,
distribution functions.

37
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.550
So this is a very complicated name for something that's very simple.
The RDF.

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.850
Now,
uh,
what about materials that don't reflect all incoming light?

39
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.880
There are some materials that transmit some of it.
So for instance,
glass,
water,

40
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.800
uh,
gemstones and such,
but it's,
it could look like that.

41
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890
And here above you can see some brds and below you can say some some things

42
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:45.930
because it's not reflected.
It's transmitted.

43
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.920
There are some materials that let them feel.
So here's an example.

44
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.790
While everyone had seen windows and things like that,
uh,

45
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.200
well the question is why?
Like just a physical question.

46
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.080
Why are these objects,
France,
Paris,
sorry.

47
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.230
Yes.
They to the lipid.
What is happening here?
Exactly.
So just some,

48
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.730
uh,
physical intricacy that

49
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.930
did the most fundamental question.
You know,
what is inside of an APP?

50
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.150
And the best answer is nothing because an atom is 99% empty space.

51
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.980
There is the nucleus,
which is,
uh,

52
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.930
the whole anthem is the size,
for instance,
of a football field.

53
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:40.890
If you imagined that,

54
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.250
that the nucleus is a small piece of rice in the middle of the football field,

55
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
that's the nucleus.
And the electrons are also very small.

56
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:53.910
Things like small rises,

57
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.540
which are orbiting dislocate lists from very far away like the side sides of the

58
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.910
football field and in between there's nothing,
absolutely nothing.

59
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.330
So the more interesting question would be why is not everything transparent?

60
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.721
I mean,

61
00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:17.721
there's absolutely nothing in there that would divert that or absorb delight,

62
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.310
right?
Everything,
just everything should go through.

63
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.730
Why is not everything transparent,
not only us but everything.

64
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.640
And the reason is uh,
absorption.

65
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.730
So these electrons are orbiting the nucleus.

66
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.470
And what essentially is happening is that electrons,

67
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.550
Kendo Sword,
four months,

68
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.740
four months are if you imagine a life as master raise or not waves,

69
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:49.410
but particles,
then following is the basic particle of light.

70
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.880
So electrons,
steak,
absorb photons.
And if they do,

71
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.500
they go from an owner or a bit like a lower energy level,

72
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.550
they jump to a higher energy level because it's,
it's basically you after lunch,

73
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:06.090
you eat something,
you get more energetic,
you get,
you get more jumpy.

74
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:10.650
So it jumps to an outer orbit,
uh,
from the nucleus.

75
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.410
It's a bit further away.
So it's,

76
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.470
it's sourced the light so the light doesn't go through.

77
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.310
So this is why most things are not transparent.

78
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.030
But the question is why is stem glass transparent?

79
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.160
And the answer is that these Barbie's is different.
Uh,

80
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.960
places around the nucleus.

81
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:36.420
They are so far apart that in the visible light spectrum,

82
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.300
if the electrons to absorb it for them,

83
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.680
they don't get enough energy to jump to the next orbit.

84
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.750
And this is why all this is why most of the light is going through this last

85
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.460
materials.
And

86
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.240
this is not always the case is the case for visible light spectrum.

87
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.710
There is a matter of spectrum which is absorbed.
So if you have a spectrum,

88
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.740
that gift that is a higher energy spectrum that it may give enough energy for

89
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.900
this electron to jump to a different orbit.
And uh,

90
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.990
we can easily find out,
uh,

91
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.610
what spectrum it is because for instance,

92
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.750
we use glass for a number of different beneficial things.
Well,
for instance,

93
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.930
you cannot get sunburn if you are inside of the house and you have your windows

94
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:34.421
closed and we are wearing sunglasses in order to protect our eyes from

95
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:36.800
something.
So,
uh,

96
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.490
is there someone who tells me what this spectrum is that exactly,

97
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.900
uh,
just a bit louder.
Ultraviolet.
Exactly.

98
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.901
Sahil Trevalla is a heart as a spectrum with a higher amount of energy is,

99
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.950
uh,
and,
and if you absorb it,
then this job is possible.

100
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.330
So this is why it is absorbed.
So just some physical intricacies.

101
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.110
So,
uh,

102
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.810
lights may get reflected if we have a material that most of the time reflects

103
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:13.310
light and we call it the BRDF.
The art is,
the interesting part is to reflection.

104
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.440
And if it transmit on is possible with the material model,
we have the BTDF,

105
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:22.040
which is divided reaction of transmittance distribution function.

106
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.990
And uh,
as an umbrella term for both of these,

107
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.410
this is basically the,
whatever term is BSDF.

108
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.780
So by direction of scattering distribution function,

109
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.750
I'm not saying this because this is lots of fun.

110
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.000
I'm saying this because you're going to find this,

111
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:40.370
these terms in the literature all the time.

112
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.240
So BSDF is basically things that reflect and things that transmit,

113
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.770
okay,
what other properties of brds.
And after this week,

114
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.940
we'll suddenly put together something beautiful very rapidly.

115
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.430
So there's townhalls.

116
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.270
Reciprocity means that their direction of the Ray of light can be reversed.

117
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.350
When it means mathematically is that I can swap the incoming and outgoing

118
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:10.620
directions and I'm going to get the same probabilities.

119
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.650
So the probability of going here to there is the same probability as coming from

120
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.660
there to here.
If I look at things,

121
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.243
<v 1>uh,</v>

122
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.800
<v 0>from both sides,
I will get the same problem.
So that's,</v>

123
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.310
that's often useful.
Uh,
in physics positivity,

124
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.030
this is a suffix.
We're not dory.
Well,
uh,

125
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.320
it cannot be less than zero are probably the two cannot be less than zero.

126
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.790
For every outgoing direction there is some positive probability or their zero.

127
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:46.320
That's it.
Nothing else is really possible.
So formula,

128
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.770
this is how it looks like and it makes some met in additions awfully happy

129
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.480
and there's energy conservation.
The most important property,

130
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.410
uh,
an object may reflect or absorb incoming light,

131
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.680
but it is impossible that more is coming out.

132
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.360
And the incoming amount,
well,

133
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.890
obviously we have light sources and things like that,

134
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.930
but we are talking about sweet material and models.
Uh,

135
00:09:13.931 --> 00:09:18.931
so this means that if I integrate this function for all possible incoming

136
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.470
directions,
uh,
then I get,

137
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.690
if I take into consideration light attenuation that we have talked about this,

138
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.780
this,
uh,
why it is so hot,
uh,

139
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.530
noon and why it is so cold at night,
then I'm going to get one or less.

140
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.530
And this is because if you take most one,

141
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.670
and this means that this kind of material,
uh,

142
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.980
reflects all the light that comes in and if it's less than one than this means

143
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:49.980
that some of the flights is absorbed.
Okay?

144
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:52.560
We are almost there at the rendering equation.

145
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.890
Generally what we are going to do is that we pick a point x and this direction

146
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.130
is going to point towards the camera.

147
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:06.120
Or my eye is just basically means the same thing.
It's just an obstruction.

148
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.540
And what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to sum up all the possible incoming

149
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.660
directions where light can come to this point.

150
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.710
And I've interested in how much has it impacted towards my direction.

151
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.040
And let's not forget that objects can emit light themselves.

152
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.370
<v 1>Okay?</v>

153
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.600
<v 0>And we will also compute this refracted amount of fluff.
So,
uh,</v>

154
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.400
just intuition,

155
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.670
light exiting the surface towards my eye is the amount that it is itself.

156
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.660
It's a light source and the amount that it reflects from the incoming light that

157
00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:46.280
comes from is zero things.

158
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.320
And this is how we can formally write this with this beautiful uh,

159
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.080
integral equation.
Let's see,

160
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.210
let's tear it a Sandler and see what happens.

161
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.930
Well this is the amount of light.

162
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.080
So this is light from point going towards my eye,

163
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.040
how much it did while the amounts that is in point x and knitted towards my,

164
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.000
if it's a light source like that one,

165
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.630
then I definitely have this amount and there is an amount,

166
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.160
the barrier flat that that is reflected.
Let's see what's going on.

167
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.100
It says what I just told you and again,
and this is the integration,

168
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.460
this is the interesting part.

169
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.420
So I am in integrating this Omega prime,

170
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.850
so all possible incoming directions.

171
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:36.590
What you have seen the hemisphere on the previous image hemisphere means

172
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:38.960
basically halls,
one half of a sphere.

173
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.690
We are integrating go her hemisphere,
not over here,

174
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.550
not over a full sphere because if we're taking into consideration the co sign,

175
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.160
if the light comes from the bath that's cosigned,
zero degrees is one.

176
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.100
And as I rotate this light source around this point,

177
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.670
then this code sign we'll get to the 90 degrees.

178
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.590
So from here to there and the cosign of 90 degrees is zero.

179
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.160
Therefore it is going to be no throughput if it comes from that direction.

180
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.080
And if I have something that's higher that would be negative.

181
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:18.490
We don't deal with these cases.
So this is why I'm integrating over a hemisphere.

182
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.470
So sunlight is coming to this point in different directions.

183
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.270
And what I'm interesting in interested in is how much is this of this light is

184
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.680
reflecting towards my app.

185
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.080
This is multiplied by,
uh,
the incoming radiance.

186
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.400
There is the BRDF and light attenuation.
That's it.

187
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.480
Uh,
this is still a bit difficult.

188
00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:48.950
This is still a bit and do safe.

189
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.190
So first we are going to train ourselves like bodybuilders on smaller weights.

190
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.830
So we are going to create it an easier version of this.
Uh,

191
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.720
because apparently this is terribly difficult to solve.

192
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.400
If you take a look and if you would sit down and try to solve it for a difficult

193
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:11.401
scene where you have objects and geometries and and different brds different

194
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.850
material models,
you will find that this is impossible to solve analogy.
Cool.

195
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.730
And one of the first problems is yes,

196
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.000
this is the question is just for one point.

197
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.920
So we are looking at one point and then you want to exactly.
Yes.

198
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.410
And and here it comes to cash.

199
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.820
So I'm interested in how much light is going towards my iPhone.
This point,

200
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.170
how much is it?
Well it depends.
If I turn on,
I don't light sources,

201
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:47.700
then this point is going to be brighter because the radiance coming out of this

202
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:52.170
point depends on its surroundings.
Is the window open?

203
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.860
Are The curtains pulled or an office.
So x,

204
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.790
this point x depends on this other point why for instance,

205
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.890
all other points.
Then we can say,
okay,
let's not compute this x first.

206
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:08.760
Let's compute this y point in steps first.
Because then I will do x.

207
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.230
Okay?

208
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.230
But this why also depends on x because how bright light is on the other side of

209
00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:18.480
the room also depends on how bright it is in this side of the,

210
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.840
so there is some uh,

211
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.860
recurrent there and it's if you,
if you don't think out of the box,

212
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:30.740
this is impossible to solve because you don't know where to start.

213
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:32.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.880
<v 0>This integral is hopeless to compute enclosed form because there may be shapes</v>

215
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.350
and different objects in there and this will make integration in mass and

216
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:43.184
difficult.

217
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:44.800
<v 1>Okay?</v>

218
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.570
<v 0>Integral is in financial law.</v>

219
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.020
Later you will see that if I compute one bounce,

220
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.730
this x that I have been talking about,
that's okay,

221
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:56.090
but I need to compute multiple bounces.

222
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.420
I need to start tracing race from the camera and see how much light is entering

223
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.240
the lens of the camera.
That one balance is not enough.
Is Two pounds is enough.

224
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.380
So after the x,
I can I continue somewhere else?
Is this enough?

225
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.700
Say something.
Okay.

226
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.250
But I think maybe three is a half is three enough?

227
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.160
It's not enough.
Okay.
Well you guys are very picky.
Okay.
Uh,

228
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.750
is it bounces enough?
Okay.
Why not?

229
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.280
Because there's still some amount of energy laughed that if I would continue

230
00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:40.770
this life path,
I would encounter other objects.

231
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.330
I don't have any knowledge of that.

232
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.500
We need to compute an infinite amount of bounces.
Even the 1000 is not else.

233
00:15:47.501 --> 00:15:48.210
So,

234
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.210
and this render in the equation is going to be 1.1 and if I want to compute the

235
00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.280
second bounce that's going to be embedded,

236
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.160
there's going to be embedded in another integral equation on other rendering the

237
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.580
equation.
And this goes on infinitely.

238
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:05.060
This is the biggest equation in the whole university.

239
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:08.520
It's impossible to solve and it is often singular.

240
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:13.260
I knew later show you why.
So even if you would want to integrate it,
you could.

241
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.580
So,
uh,
this is far too difficult.
It seems impossible.

242
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.900
And the Pantry at this point,
we cannot solve it.

243
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:27.060
So this is the end of the course and we have an impossible problem.

244
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.710
There is no reason even to try and goodbye.
See you.

245
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.670
Never,

246
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.960
because there's never going to be any more lectures back in order to understand

247
00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:38.520
what's going on.
Uh,

248
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.450
firstly we're going to put together a simpler version of this equation that we

249
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:46.140
can understand and we can work our way up.
Uh,
there,

250
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.510
there is another formulation of the render in the question.

251
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.090
I'm not going to deal with this too much.
Uh,

252
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:56.270
you can imagine this other version as moving points around.

253
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.510
So,
uh,

254
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.680
there is a light source and beef meat and there is the sensor at p zero.

255
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.410
And this is one example life path.

256
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.330
And what I'm doing is I'm not stopping at one point and integrating all possible

257
00:17:09.331 --> 00:17:13.590
in coming directions because this is what I did with the original formulation.

258
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.140
What I do is I compared to one life path,

259
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.690
I compute how much light is going through.

260
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.710
I add that to the sensor and then I moved this p two around,

261
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.830
I move into up bit,
I computer new like that.

262
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.890
How much is going to move this Peter around again?

263
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.040
So imagine this movie everywhere and imagine also p one movie and we were,

264
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:39.110
so all of these points are moving everywhere and I compute the contribution of

265
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.040
this light source to the sensor.
So this is another kind of integration.

266
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.100
I'm not going to go through this.
Uh,

267
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.860
what is interesting is that there is a geometry in there,

268
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.080
and,
uh,

269
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.400
this describes the geometry to relation of different points of light attenuation

270
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:00.060
between them.
Uh,
I'm not going to deal with this too much.

271
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.190
I just put it here because,
uh,

272
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.900
if you're interested then true your way through it.
And in literature,

273
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.210
they often write it this way.
