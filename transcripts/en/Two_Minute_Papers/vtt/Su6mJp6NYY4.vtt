1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.610
We had gone through some problems.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.350
So we wanted to integrate this puncture to task science,

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:12.351
Clara's ex from CEO to fire and through engineering or through mathematics,

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:17.160
we realized that it should be part.
And what we did is that we,

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:17.994
the ramp,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the code that would integrate this through Monte Carlo integration and the

7
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:27.060
garden wall and stuff.
So there is some problem,

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.800
there is some insufficient knowledge that we have that we have to remedy in some

9
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.530
way.
So why don't you take a look at the lottery example.

10
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:37.890
We should reveal what would evolve.
So that seems a great,

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.980
this unbelievably difficult function from one to zero.

12
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.300
Obviously this is x squared over pool and the brackets showing your dad.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.470
We have to substitute this form of the fire.
What we get in me on the spot

14
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.490
now let's do Monte Carlo integration plan that we can integrate this function as

15
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.780
we would like to not medically.

16
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.890
So I think three completely random samples of this function.

17
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.480
What does it mean that I desire it?
F of x at wall.

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.080
Now if I evaluate this exit one,
I obviously yet are you evaluated?

19
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.010
We,
and I also get that sweet.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.820
So I have free samples now and what I do is I see the average that,

21
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.910
so this is one plus three plus five over three to Andrew's office suite.

22
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.630
I've,
it shouldn't be that right because the address old Phil and how that,

23
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.140
the integration is exactly four times that.

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.220
So something that gives back on people,
this multicolored integrations.

25
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.060
So what we know is that three is exactly one for 12 so we see that there is a

26
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:51.100
difference file off the factor of forum and if you take a closer look at the

27
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:55.080
integration domain that he will see that four is exactly the size

28
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.270
in fall.
So just empirically,

29
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.360
if we don't,

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.060
this is one angle to look at a problem and to solve it you will see multiple I

31
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.490
was,
this is more like the engineering,
the way of solving things.

32
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800
You don't know how to derive the forehand correct solution that you see that

33
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.390
there is a factor of four.
Four is the size of the integration domain.
Well,

34
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.500
why don't we move to bottle that and see what happens?
And I'll be asleep.

35
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.970
So you can multiply with the size of the integration domain we get the result

36
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:33.390
that they're looking for.
So let's change the quote.

37
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.360
I want to buy the previous function with integration domain,

38
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:44.740
which is five zero two five and this is what I will do.
Fine.

39
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.010
And obviously I haven't yet.
I saw that result,
which is the correct some stuff,

40
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.340
whatever it is.
Now this is great and this looks very simple

41
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.680
and just technique seems to work,

42
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.070
but we still have bomb to really know what is happening here.

43
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.610
So we should use some black magic or mathematics,
if you will,

44
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.650
to see what is going on down here.

45
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720
So imagine that we sample a function with the uniform distribution on cdot.

46
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.380
What does it mean?

47
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.680
I have an interval from zero to Pi and I generate random numbers on it and every

48
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.620
single number has the very same property.

49
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.570
So this function would look like one of her pipe regardless of x in the,

50
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.030
in the parameter it gives.

51
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:39.400
If that's a matter we spark off the domain.
I choose,

52
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.520
it will have the same problem would be chosen not

53
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.080
what we are essentially doing is integrating your function f of x multiplied by

54
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.390
this salvation.
Why?

55
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.930
Because imagine that some regions of the Faxon would have zero problem needed to

56
00:03:58.691 --> 00:03:59.410
be supple.

57
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.340
So imagine that by integrating from zero to Pi,
the Bible,

58
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.760
all the examples from zero to two.

59
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.040
So there's a region in the function that I'm never going to visit and I don't

60
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.874
integrate.

61
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.763
<v 1>Right.</v>

62
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.020
<v 0>So that's one intuition.
Intuition is that if I draw samples,</v>

63
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.640
not with uniform you stupid person,

64
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.760
but with a different distribution that in the average to buy computer,

65
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.340
some regions off the fashion,

66
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.920
we would be over because I have a higher tensile stuff that you goes.

67
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.630
So what we are doing is multiplying is apoe facts with the salmon.

68
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.090
Probably Pee pee of X.

69
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.600
I'll just feel facts is in this case to one of our pilot uniform is to

70
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.100
commission,
which is obviously a constant.
So get out of line at all.

71
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.230
<v 0>And India,
we have the funding in general,</v>

73
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.650
the fashion over pile.
But this is not what I'm looking for.

74
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:58.080
I just wanted to make the function itself,
so I need to make it disappear.

75
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.240
So I have this one over pilot to buyer,

76
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.570
what do I need to multiply with to get all in his function?

77
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.090
What should the question mark be?

78
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.060
Excellent.
Exactly.
So I just killed this one of our pie will get louder,

79
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
which is is the effect something distribution and if you'd take a look that yes,

80
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.060
this is also the size of the depression,

81
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.930
so this is a bit more rigorous.

82
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.570
It'd be boring or swayed to understand what is going on.

83
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.210
This is through a delegation that just empirical stuff,

84
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.990
what should I learn to fly with?
We know that'd be more about what is happening.

85
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.980
I have a sampling distribution that I need to get it done.

86
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.260
So if I have the one over five multiplier,

87
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.350
I got the one incorrectly and if I lose this scanner multifier that I'm looking

88
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.870
forward for that I will get to the correct.

89
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.070
Let's the whole thing

90
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 1>could be 40 feet different.
The Anglos,
I would like to solve the problem,</v>

91
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.560
solve the same problem.
It won't.
It will be put back.
So it's super quick.

92
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.960
Probably the theory,
we have an expected value.

93
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.560
This is what we're looking for.
What is an expected value?

94
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.350
The expected value means that there's a value of something and there's a

95
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.210
probability of getting these values.

96
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.620
So let's take the expected time of the Gospel doesn't work.

97
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.710
I can roll from one to six and they all have the same power or roles have seen

98
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.170
probably p one six

99
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.800
so the values are one to up to six and the probabilities were all the same

100
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.050
losses.
And if I'd have to stop that,

101
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:47.051
this says that the expected value of the dice roll 3.5 well this means that if I

102
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:50.870
need,
if I would need to guess

103
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.800
what the next by Saul would be,

104
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.070
that this will be the best value in order to minimize the error for dates back.

105
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.930
<v 0>No.</v>

106
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.670
If we would like to compute the expected valuable something that this means that

107
00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:13.030
I think the values that is something can pay and I won't divide the problem.

108
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.110
What is it that for instance,

109
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.810
it is impossible possible to the whole seven with the dice.

110
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.020
So theoretically you could put as the something the Saturday there by people,

111
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.950
perhaps it or probably we matters one

112
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.670
and this is the district pays for the continuous case.

113
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.400
We don't really need to do anything very serious.

114
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.740
We just change the summation to integration.

115
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.980
So we are not using the speedy stop you to me continue to stock shelves and

116
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.450
maybe using continuous self distributions.

117
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.820
Now let's introduce this notation.

118
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.240
What I'm looking for is the expected value of this function f of x after an m a

119
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:58.490
model because it won't be out of the operation.

120
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.570
You need to add more and more samples to get more or is that

121
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.230
not,

122
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.970
what this means is f is the something and he is the sampling distribution

123
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.500
we can do is that we cannot create a discrete some that takes samples of this

124
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.950
fox run and that multiplies with the size of the domain.

125
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.600
And obviously since we are taking the salmon need to divide it by that because

126
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.600
the more sample,

127
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.720
and it was the natural step was the more samples would they fund the function

128
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.490
the larger the number of yet.
So this is yeah.
Region.

129
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.713
No,

130
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.510
you have to take a look at always the key looking at the relevant quantities.

131
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.270
So the expected value of this f of x.

132
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.400
It doesn't mean that in integration I won't apply as with this something

133
00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:53.760
probability and a lot of the right side and the Monte Carlo has to me,

134
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.750
I will have the same as on the left side.

135
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.600
So if I'm looking for the expected way a little x,

136
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.180
I will sample apple profiles.

137
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.950
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

138
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.540
<v 0>no.
If you,</v>

139
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.790
if you'll take a look that you can see that this is just an approximation.

140
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.380
This is not be segregated to gold looking forward,

141
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.560
but there is a multitude of theory Reps.
Yeah,

142
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.910
computer science that showing you that if you could use an infinite amount of

143
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.310
samples,
then you will get poached.
The actual

144
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.830
mold courses all want to call it integration,

145
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.420
show you different ways of proving this.

146
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.860
That's this is not what the art leads us to do.

147
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.770
He would just believe that this is what is happening is actually very this,

148
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.980
why does this happen?

149
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.310
You remember seeing his sideway that'd be saddled with all these blue and all.

150
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.100
So you can see that if you have the law of samples,

151
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.300
you look at the destination on Aaron.

152
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.663
<v 1>Perfect.</v>

153
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.220
<v 0>Nah,
let's try to use different [inaudible] in a few minutes.</v>

154
00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:00.910
You will see why this would be a good idea in some cases.

155
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.240
So I would like to integrate this f of x and I am out doing the transformation.

156
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.780
That is the identity,
fast relation,
but I didn't do anything to why the facts.

157
00:10:10.781 --> 00:10:14.180
I moved to buy it by p of x and then I divided by,

158
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.440
so this is almost like a scalable the buyer and that might be by him just same

159
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.160
number.
I get the very same thing.
But

160
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.160
if I would like to write that this is the expected value or something,

161
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.670
then this will look a bit different because f over p is the salt thing and he'll

162
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.870
ask perception problem.

163
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.080
So what we have now is the expected value of that.

164
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.660
<v 0>The question is what is the Monte Carlo Escondido for this and what we can put</v>

166
00:10:47.171 --> 00:10:51.160
it in the previous slides that you should be the very same quantity as what I

167
00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:54.950
see in the expected value.
So I will be something f over.

168
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.700
So not only something I'm sadly,

169
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.800
sadly over arbitrarily chosen deep distribution.

170
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.970
Now there are some good meetings on how to do this well and why this is useful.

171
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.010
So if you would like to know more about this,

172
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:17.011
please leave some of these documents and that's a bad thing nowadays because

173
00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:23.851
I've seen lots of muscle them guidance on all of the power in Russia for a very

174
00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:29.980
long time to find something that has the quality that I shouldn't evolve rather

175
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:30.814
than people to study.

176
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.230
That's all of the actual examples that we have for use with this form though.

177
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.210
So app over bead times speed.

178
00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:45.211
So I am still integrating Boomi F and a sounding distribution was this two times

179
00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:48.940
science square x.

180
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.720
This was the function that we wanted to integrate and one of her eyes are

181
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.020
stocking distribution,
probably t sorry,

182
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.890
uniform distribution over one.
So

183
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.050
getting back into the original function.

184
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.700
So I'm looking forward to expected value.
That's f over g.

185
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.330
So I'm going to sample in my fault that over.

186
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.850
Let's put this in source code.
If you look here,

187
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.940
I know if I buy the something is to do so.

188
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.920
So it's one over B minus eight so this means one of the Pi e eight is a should

189
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:30.990
have begun seeing in this case.
So I apologize for that.

190
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.080
The facets of the bowl,

191
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.490
I put the 2.5 in there because if you always,

192
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.830
he is always,

193
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:43.831
you know that you may light poles that works for integration from zero to

194
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.060
something but not one to someday.

195
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.690
So this is a cool thing to check if you have devoted to this.

196
00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:52.990
So I apologize this age should be zero,

197
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.330
but if you compute the actual results that you would be looking for that need to

198
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:01.280
look at your pile.
So this is the APP.
Okay.

199
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.560
The first term and the Tommy Line 36 and after the vision we have,

200
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.051
okay,
wonderful.

201
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:14.051
So is worse and from multiple angles we now understand how exactly this thing

202
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:18.520
gets work.
Not if you write the goods.

203
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.600
One thing how integration with team and his saw that rendering equation with

204
00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:28.340
this,
what you want to see is that as you add more samples,

205
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.350
we'll see first you're really noisy

206
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.640
and that as you add more and more samples,

207
00:13:34.641 --> 00:13:38.190
this noise will slowly and do you feel,

208
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.780
if you think back either is that her mine we have talked about over and other

209
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.390
destinations off the liberal and this is exactly what shows up.

210
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.560
Also he images.
We are five to Sapele Fatia.

211
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.670
I would like to be interested in the radio spots as I have one more samples

212
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.600
before I converge.
I will get,
I use that are larger,

213
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:05.260
that'd be excellent at this and I didn't have to use that are smaller.

214
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.620
So this is what shows up initially as malls.

215
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.300
So what you are looking for is always is samples from pixel metric and when you

216
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.430
have a noisy image you would need to know how many cycles I have used for basal

217
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.570
and if it's still noisy Danny,
we need to add more samples.

218
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.720
This is also some visualization on on the evolution of the image after hundreds

219
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:37.051
and then 100,000 samples depending on the algorithm is multiple ways of solving.

220
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.140
You could have smarter algorithms that take longer to complete one sample

221
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.310
because they are doing soft,

222
00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:51.311
smart magic that this would mean that you will need less samples will be sold,

223
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.820
we'll get reimbursed yet.

224
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.330
And the first I heard from that is actually the naive out off any needs.

225
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.890
Usually it's a tremendous amount of samples,
computer language,

226
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.100
but since he is a simple algorithm you can use your GPU or cvs would dish out a

227
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.040
lot of samples for pixels it ever since.

228
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.850
<v 1>No.</v>

229
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.060
<v 0>Oh Pete Dawson beauty break.</v>

230
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.030
This is what we can get if we buy and slash or off base on

231
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.410
this was rather than last founder and some recent example.

232
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.850
Does anyone know who this is?

233
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.233
<v 1>Please?
Your hand?</v>

234
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.820
<v 0>Any of the people.
Excellent.</v>

235
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.340
So this is actually Marjorie materiel from the game of Thrones.

236
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.660
Eddie.
Anyone who tells me as boilers,
I was born on that page.
Okay,

237
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.960
so Jeez and this is actuality because the game of false is running.

238
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.780
Obviously we all love the show and there's also steam the,

239
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.120
so there's Thomas all soft surfaces salary.

240
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.480
And you can solve this with a simple office are definitely going to put together

241
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.510
the theoretical part in the second half of this lecture,

242
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.840
the last lecture.
So when I see renders like this,

243
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.890
what I feel is all income parable to religious spiritual wonder.

244
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.720
It is,

245
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.700
it's absolutely amazing that we can confuse something like this using only

246
00:16:27.701 --> 00:16:31.020
mathematics.
He's very simple tools that I assume.

247
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.590
And the other really cool thing is that we are writing these algorithms,

248
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.130
we are creating products that use these algorithms and these aren't,

249
00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:46.131
he's up to world class artists who are just as good as an artist as we are

250
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:49.154
engineers.

251
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.220
And they are also giving it their best to pre more at four feet or miles and we

252
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:58.820
can work together to create stuff like that.
So this is absolutely.
