1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.993
Oh,

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.450
how was the Easter break with lice too short?

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.333
Come on.

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.380
What would be an appropriate lens for

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.930
52
curriculum?

6
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.050
So every time by just two more weeks or something?
Yeah.

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
Well,
uh,
I don't know about about uh,
Austria,

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
but in Hungary,
people usually uh,
go to their friends,
you know,

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.110
many people are coming over and we are hanging out with other people and you

10
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.730
always have to drink their stuff.
So if you go there and,

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.880
and,
and we have this drink that's called the filing cup.

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.110
It's something like the snaps but,
but way stronger.

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.790
And I told this to Samsung Austrian people and they were like,
oh my God,

14
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.380
stronger than the synopsis.
How can that be very easily.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.300
At least they are hungry.
So that's how it works.
And you,
you go to the,

16
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:14.301
to the very first place and you have to drink from their homeroom or full card.

17
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
Usually it's very helpful and even as to say something good about it.

18
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.160
So you drink it and it's like,
ah,

19
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.270
but you have to say something good about this because they are,

20
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:27.750
they're looking at you and you know what,
what would be the reaction?

21
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.670
So you say that it would,
that's,

22
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
that's really strong

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.700
and then most people seem to be satisfied with that,
so,
right.

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310
This is usually what I say.
But then when,

25
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.820
when you are at like the fifth station for Debbie Day and,

26
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.230
and some people just don't take no for an answer,
unfortunately.
So this,

27
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.410
this is how it goes is it is better in Austria.

28
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,

29
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.050
that's the family part is actually that the nice part.

30
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
So we can decide if we drink our own stuff or not.
But,

31
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.900
uh,
I mean my fiance,
his grandfather attempted to make some brooms,

32
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.780
some highly card home and while he did something,
so I mean,

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.640
something was created in the process,
but,
uh,
after,

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.200
after tasting it,
even,
even the postman didn't want to drink it.

35
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.660
I don't know about postman in Austria,

36
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.380
but in Hungary,
they are like really hardly people.
So they,

37
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.670
they drink whatever they find because,
because obviously you don't,

38
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.690
you don't give the good stuff for the postman.
You,
you give them the leftovers.

39
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:45.760
So it's like no,
no one dragged out.
So it could be good for the postmark.

40
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.020
And this happened with that.
Imagine that.

41
00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.160
Yeah.
Well they are.
Oh they are.

42
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.090
They,
they seem to like alcohol according to my experiences.
So,

43
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.260
um,
and even the postman didn't want to drink that anymore.

44
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.530
So like next time we have seen him around the house and he just came like in,

45
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.520
in front of the main main door and,
and,
and we waved to him.

46
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.410
Hey,
come when we have some for you.
I tell them that.
No,

47
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.850
I'm just going to put them in here immediately.

48
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.290
Okay.
So regarding the assignments,
uh,
you guys are guards have done really well,

49
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:37.291
so I'm very happy to see that or realize that there is some exponentiality with

50
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:42.301
respect to the depth of the singing lessons or the more deep ego,

51
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.720
then the more exponential things become.
But this is after like,

52
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.830
I mean it's exponential all along but you don't notice because it starts off

53
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.640
slow.
But after like 10 to 15 boxes,
you can can't,
you can see a very,

54
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.560
uh,
Tommy characteristic of this export control distributor ship.

55
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.863
And,

56
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.300
and many of you have recognized correctly that this is because a refraction and

57
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:11.230
reflection are sampled all the time.
So whenever I have a bounce,

58
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.600
I am going to,
uh,

59
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.520
compute an intersection and then there's going to be two res perhaps that

60
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:22.240
continue their way because one is going to be doing the reflection direction and

61
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:26.980
one is with fractions.
And this quickly gets out of hand because forever ray,

62
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:30.340
you have to work.
That's the definition of something.
Excellent.

63
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.810
So,
well done.
Let's proceed a bit.

64
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.680
I'm going to talk just a bit about some advanced,

65
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.220
a bit more advanced BRDF models that are mostly used me facing.

66
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.130
So you remember this one version,
the RDF that you see on the right.

67
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.630
And this is the scalar product between Al and Dan.

68
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:53.680
So the light factor and the normal,

69
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.310
and obviously you can't scale this with Katie,
which is some kind of diffuse up.

70
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.323
<v 1>No.</v>

71
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.850
<v 0>Now if you put it next to a really Mitch often diffuse material,</v>

72
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.710
obviously it is a question,
you know,

73
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.030
what do we call it diffuse material or where was this photograph?
How exactly,

74
00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:13.650
but let,
let's disregard this and let,

75
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.430
let's accept that we have this difference between the two.

76
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.180
And if you take a good look then it's becomes apparent that in grazing gambles,

77
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.150
<v 0>does simulated diffuse material seems to be completely taught.</v>

79
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.360
And if you take a look at the formula update and this,

80
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.390
this is a self explanatory because the normal and the light direction and the

81
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:42.440
normal and the light direction can get perpendicular and then you will,

82
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.330
you will see this darkness.

83
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.440
So there are some advanced BRDF models that try to be a bit more realistic in

84
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.980
this regard.
Such example is the oral nay or model,

85
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.070
which is much closer to what you would it.
You can be locked.

86
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.380
But next notes that all of these simplified BRDF,
smart Dvr,

87
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:08.330
dof models,
these are all tax.
This is not what physical reality is.

88
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.510
People write up the actual equations that relate to physical reality and trying

89
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:13.660
to simplify in a way,

90
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.480
but the simple range or can capture and we are going to talk about global

91
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.490
defects and what the real diffuse material looks like in three minutes.

92
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.120
So this RNA or model seems much better and what's even more,

93
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.240
it can take into consideration these Microsoft thick imperfections in different

94
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.080
materials and

95
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.030
you can get a rough nest parameter that can model these imperfections.

96
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.480
What about specular models where the Ford Model T.
Dot.

97
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.930
Our that we have talked about is not the only way to do it.

98
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.810
There is also the phone plane model,

99
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840
which is a more advanced model and uses this age is how factor it LMP and it

100
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.840
produces different results.
I think this,

101
00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:11.150
this image is maybe not the best because yes the highlights are different,

102
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:16.151
but one of the main advantage advantages of this material model is that the

103
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:20.950
shape of the specular reflections can get a bit more elliptic depending on the

104
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:23.590
viewing direction and the surroundings.

105
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.700
So here you have the very same circular thing.
So it's,

106
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:31.240
it's not the best example,
but you can see that it's different.

107
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.650
It looks more realistic.

108
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.570
And we still have to think about the fact that these are still really good

109
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:40.140
models,
that the fees are still,

110
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.773
<v 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.290
<v 0>there's also the Cook Torres model that's basically phone blend that can model</v>

112
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.770
also Microsoft office.
And uh,

113
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:55.090
here maybe with the projector of,
maybe it's not so visible,

114
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.140
but you can see that a specular reflection here is a bit more easier.

115
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:03.100
So it's not a completely,
uh,
rounds here.

116
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.510
It's not a perfect sphere.

117
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.540
There are these small imperfections that are characteristic to reinforcing

118
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.580
materials.
So this is what this model can capture.

119
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.480
And there are some other advanced BRDF models,

120
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.610
some of which are more easy to understand them implement than it is to pronounce

121
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:26.260
the name of the authors of the BRDF models.
This is one of those examples.

122
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.100
And this is some kind of in the year model where you have a diffuse substrate

123
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.640
and you have like the coating,
a specular coating.

124
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200
So there are also be rds for car paint where you can have these sparkly effects.

125
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.590
And there are many BRDF models that capture given.
Perfect.

126
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.633
<v 1>It's</v>

127
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.880
<v 0>okay.
Uh,
what if one would like to play with this?</v>

128
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.920
The Disney guys have implemented this program called the BRDF explorer and you

129
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:06.591
can move many local BRD of models and change the light source positions.

130
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.910
Look at the actual brds and I think Paul's responses.

131
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.553
Give it a try.

132
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.300
So we have always been talking about cameras.

133
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.480
So we are trying to model real world cameras.

134
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.440
If you have a handheld camera you will see a setting that's called the f stop

135
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.820
and the f stop is related to the size of the aperture.

136
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:36.821
The aperture is the opening of the camera where the light goes in and you can

137
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:41.480
set this to different values.
And you will notice that if,

138
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.690
if you set this f stop to high value than the aperture of the camera is going to

139
00:09:46.941 --> 00:09:48.050
become smaller.

140
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.940
And if it's smaller than this means that less light is that in and more of the

141
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.610
image that you get is going to be

142
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.650
and vice versa.
So if you have the low f stop setting,

143
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.570
then you will have bigger aperture.

144
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.200
More light is let in and more regions we'll be able to focus.

145
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:10.640
And this is what gives you this depth of field effect because whatever images we

146
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:15.641
have seen and created with ray tracers yet don't have this that fulfill the

147
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.990
fact.
But if you use a handheld camera,

148
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:22.460
then somehow you have to model this effect as well because this is how an image

149
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:23.294
will be created.

150
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.300
So this is a nice chart made by photograph first

151
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.880
<v 1>two</v>

152
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.810
<v 0>see how exactly these f stops relate to aperture size.</v>

153
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.200
What are the typical settings and all of these interesting things

154
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.440
and an actual example.

155
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.030
So let's take a look at the bottom right here.

156
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:48.810
<v 1>Okay,</v>

157
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.760
<v 0>you can see that the whole image is info</v>

158
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.310
and as he adjusts the f stop accordingly.
You can see the top left.

159
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.470
You can see here immediately that the background is heavily blurred.

160
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.510
So this is a more pronounced that fulfilled the fact and it would be wonderful

161
00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:10.660
to have a ray tracer that can take this effect into account.

162
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.650
And this is a ladder,
maybe a bit more beautiful under big,

163
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.920
more visible example.

164
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.760
So at the last time you can see a very pronounced that fulfill the fact that on

165
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:25.770
the right everything close to everything is in focus.
Yes.
Um,

166
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.100
do you also use the word [inaudible] for computer graphics?
Yes.

167
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.543
Yes.

168
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.330
And there's also a bunch of papers on how to assimilate this effect.

169
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:40.540
Some people even try to compute the same your time.

170
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.840
So you have like a computer game,
you would like to see this bouquet effect.

171
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.890
How did you do this?
And you have to take into consideration the depth.

172
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.210
If you know what objects are wearing exactly how far away,

173
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.280
then you can a bunch of trees to,
to,
to get something like that.

174
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.580
And approximation realtime.

175
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.140
<v 0>And if you do this something that I'm going to show you in a second,</v>

177
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.510
then you will have the very same effect in your age,

178
00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:10.950
race or so on the left completely old focus image on the right you can see again

179
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.550
the depth of field,
the fact,
especially in the background,

180
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.630
the further away you go,
the more you see.
So how do we do this?

181
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.033
Very simple.

182
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.770
Let's skip the text and I just put this here because people who read this at

183
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:27.420
home,
uh,
we'll know more about this.

184
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:32.421
So mostly most of what we do is we should or rate through the mid point of the

185
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.850
pixel in Ra tracer and this is going to touch this focal point and then hit an

186
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:43.710
object.
What we could do is that we will also take samples from nearby.

187
00:12:43.711 --> 00:12:45.420
So not only this big solar,

188
00:12:45.421 --> 00:12:50.421
not only the midpoint but from nearby and should all of these various food,

189
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:55.020
the same focal point and compute the very same samples.

190
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.580
But these samples will be nearby.

191
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.500
And what we do with the samples is we have reached them and this is what is

192
00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:03.530
going to give you this depth of field.

193
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.890
So this is already some kind of integration.

194
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.100
This means that which if you run a ray tracer and we were going to get a

195
00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:16.680
completely converged image without any noise,

196
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.400
without any problems that that image you can consider dumb.

197
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.160
But this will not be so involved.
Illumination.

198
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.690
This is a speciality of rage racers.
But if you have such an effect,

199
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.990
then you may have to wait until more and more of these samples are computed and

200
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.830
the worst move image you will get,
we will talk about this effect extensively.

201
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:41.700
It's going to be very important.
And just an important question,

202
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:45.900
what kind of material model can this be?
Obviously this is some quick,

203
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.160
perhaps open gr preview,
but it's very apparent what I see.

204
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.110
What kind of shading is this?

205
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.590
<v 0>Is it spiking?
Are,
no,
these are definitely not yours.
Okay.
What else?</v>

207
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.080
<v 0>Yes,
exactly.
So this is the long version model,</v>

209
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.290
and you can also see this effect that it's goals completely black in the space

210
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.314
and capitals.

211
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>
