WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.760
No,
we have some image from physical reality.

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.570
We have an interface that is air and glass.
Uh,

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.550
what I see here is that there is reflection and there is reflection.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.000
So in case my mother,
everyone understands the term,
uh,

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
reflection is a least reflect seawall and refraction is right with why Cory

6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.030
liberal can sure,
thank God discourse is not injured and everyone would cry.

7
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380
But you guys and girls have it easy because uh,

8
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:40.920
in Hungary and you would say theme about every dish and fainter ish.

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
So I think reflection and refraction is much better at that.

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.320
At least much more convenient question.
We're just stronger.

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.870
Which effect is stronger?

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.740
Raise your hand if you think that we a fraction that this is,

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.010
this effect is stronger.
This is the question about

14
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.890
in this exactly.
Yes.

15
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
So I can see that the refraction has a more pronounced effect as reflection
here.

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.850
Okay.
Because we will deal with this in a second.

17
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.150
<v 1>And uh,</v>

18
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.130
<v 0>what can we can do is we can actually write up the vectors that we have been</v>

19
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.410
talking about for a case like that.

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.760
This is towards the direction of the light source.
There is a surface level.

21
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
It looks like this or the normal,
it looks upwards.
This is where it's reflected.

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.220
This is where it's transmitted.

23
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:40.110
We don't have a vector for that and we have the different angles for this.
Uh,

24
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.363
wonderful.

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.660
So let's take a look at the simplified version of friend Al's equation.

26
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.600
At a simplified version of finance equation.
This one,

27
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.010
at least it's called slicks approximation.
We have no idea what this,

28
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.160
of what this is about.
This is not so complicated thing.

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.550
What this gives me is the probability of reflection.

30
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.180
So hard with Fita is the probability of reflection.

31
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.030
So as I have seen the image,

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.090
I am interested in what is the probability of reflection and refraction because

33
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480
I imagined that the probability of refraction is higher in this case and I would

34
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:19.860
like to compute it in some way in my computer program.
Well,

35
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.920
let's take a quick look at this are of theater is the probability of reflection.

36
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.460
And this is important to remember because during our calculations,

37
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.440
I will forget this approximately 15 times.
So,

38
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.600
uh,
may I ask her name?
Lisa.
Lisa.
Okay.
Uh,

39
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.000
well if I ask you,
uh,
what is arthy talk,

40
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.890
you will tell me that this is the probability of reflection.
Yes,

41
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.650
exactly.
Because I seriously,
I will,

42
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.710
I be forgetting all the time are zero is the probability of reflection on normal

43
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.050
incident.
So this means that light is coming from,

44
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.950
if it would be coming from the off,
what are the chances that it gets reflected

45
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.360
<v 1>and</v>

46
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.490
<v 0>RCO can be given by this expression.</v>

47
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:13.050
We will be talking about this and one and m two are basically in this is of your

48
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:16.620
fraction.
Uh,
we will have examples with that too,

49
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.590
but let's quickly go through this and and see if physics make any sense.

50
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.310
Makes listens well.
For an air vacuum medium,
we have,
uh,

51
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.370
let's say the index of refraction of care is one and this animal is the medium

52
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.230
that we go into.
So for instance,
here glass

53
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.083
<v 1>and</v>

54
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.200
<v 0>let's see what happens there.
But before we do that,</v>

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.000
t is the probability of transmission.
Uh,
obviously if the light is not,

56
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.410
we forget absorption for now.
Uh,
if light is not reflected,

57
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.110
then there is refraction.
It's simple as that.

58
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.850
So if I add up these two probabilities,
I get one.

59
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.440
So let's play with it.
Uh,
are at zero degrees is RCL.

60
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.160
Why?
Because cause sign of fever.

61
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.170
So the cosign of zero degrees is one.
So on the right side I have one minus one.

62
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.440
So the second term is killed by the zero.

63
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.680
Therefore I will have more zero and are at zero degrees.

64
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.760
This is the theater is the decrease the angle of the incoming light zero

65
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.570
degrees.
So it means that it comes from outwards.
What is it?

66
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.670
This is the probability of refraction of normal incidents.

67
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.230
So this is basically the very same thing.

68
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.850
So if it comes like this,
what is the,

69
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.840
what is the probability of it coming back?
Bouncing off of that last,
Eh,

70
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.080
what's up with 90 degrees while 90 degrees,

71
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.890
the cosign of theater is zero.
Therefore,

72
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.690
I will have both of these terms,

73
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.800
very simple and this is going to be one.

74
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.450
So the probability of reflection at 90 degrees is one.

75
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.200
Because imagine that I'm coming from above,

76
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.630
then this means that there is a very likely chance that I'm going to get
through.

77
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.870
So imagine a super crowded bus in the morning and you just cannot fit in there.

78
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.050
How would you like to go in?
And if you,
if you don't care about the,

79
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.400
the health and the intact,
less of the other people,

80
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.750
what you will just running there and you know,

81
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.740
hopefully they will make some space.

82
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.010
I have the best probability if I ran towards them,

83
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.260
if I will be running from the side,

84
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.140
it would be very likely that they would just push me back.

85
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.640
There's a high chance that I will be reflected.
So I want refraction,

86
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.990
I want to get on the bus.

87
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.770
It's so as I raised this and go from normal incidence,

88
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.070
the more probability there is for the rate to bounce back.

89
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.360
So this for now seems to make some yes reflection at night.

90
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.900
The reason look chose the dimension itself.

91
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.200
You have to think in terms of limits.

92
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.380
So what is the probability at 89 degrees?

93
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.470
It's going to get reflected if you just raised that you are going to approach

94
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:18.210
the problem with the deal for this is a bit of linkedin.

95
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.960
By that we can see that there is like a continuous transition.

96
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.210
<v 0>From here there's high probably into for your fraction.</v>

98
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.820
As I go to two worst 90 degrees,

99
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.590
there's more probability for reflection and we defined that at 90 degrees.

100
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:40.580
We say that it is reflection because I am moving along the boundary.

101
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:44.710
I'm not entering the class by the way.
That's a great question.

102
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.280
I was thinking about this too before.

103
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.700
So let's say that a index of refraction of glasses 1.5 let's compute this thing

104
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.994
quickly.

105
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.210
It's 1.5 over 2.5 squared and I do the very same substitution for the rest of

106
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:04.460
the equation.
Uh,
but before I get this,

107
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.950
what do I expect from the blood?

108
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.450
That's the another important mathematical principle.

109
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:16.310
Do this all the time before you compute the result stage,

110
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:20.270
what you would expect from the result because this gives you a much higher level

111
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.104
of understanding.

112
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.540
What I'm interesting in our,

113
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.210
of what does our of Teton,

114
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.200
excellent.
Okay.
Liza male sit again.

115
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.530
So at the probability of reflection at zero degrees I would say

116
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.760
is something very low.
All right.
Okay.

117
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:48.560
So I have written this year that are of zero is less than 0.2 up because it's a

118
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:49.394
probability

119
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.320
is the probability off.
Oh,
so

120
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.690
yeah.
So the problem is your reflection is low.
I would say less than 10%.

121
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.910
So if I come from upwards,
a refraction is likely,

122
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.780
I'm very likely to get on the bus if I ran into the people from the front.
Uh,

123
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.420
okay.
Uh,
what's up with,
for instance,
uh,

124
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.340
60 degrees.

125
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.580
What we know exactly what happens at 60 degrees because how many degrees do we

126
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:28.000
have here?
What is the incidence?
Mouth?

127
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.430
It's 60 and we can see that at 60 degrees there is a chance for reflection and

128
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:37.520
reflection and refraction.
Chance.
Yes.

129
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.730
Higher.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So what I would imagine,
yes,

130
00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:49.110
that at 60 degrees there is a higher chance of reflection.

131
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.550
That is then the previous one I'm in.

132
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:57.660
But refraction is still stronger as you can see on the image and we,

133
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.390
we are going to compute this and we are going to be lat.

134
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.650
You're going to let nature be our judge whether the calculation is correct or

135
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.590
not.
So 60 degrees,
I quickly uh,

136
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.820
uh converted two radios,
that's more or less one.

137
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.980
And so our of one is all point to this means 20% chance of reflection,

138
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.450
80% of refraction.
It seems to be in line of what I see here.

139
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.550
But this is just my expectation

140
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.560
and what we have been talking about Pi over two this means 90 degree angle.

141
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.740
I would expect it to be one.
So if I converted to radio stuff,

142
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.060
this is 1.7 so our of one point seller pay expecting to the month,

143
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.230
let's put all of these together and let's do what engineers do all the time.

144
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.350
We'll put involved from all thought and try to plot this.

145
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.620
So I imagine that our of zero is less than 0.1 so getting on the bus easily well

146
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.780
are at zero is less than 0.1 so far so good

147
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.610
are at one is less than 1.2 this is the 60 degrees mostly refraction well are at

148
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.130
one is less than awkward too.

149
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.160
So checkmark and are at around 1.7 is indeed around one.

150
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.350
So apparently physicists are small people and physics makes sense.

151
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.150
So pretty good.
But there is something fishy about this.

152
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.630
So this,
this,
this is correct.

153
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.810
I mean what we see here is in line with our expectations,

154
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.750
but there's something fishy about this plot.

155
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.490
Raise your hand if you know what it is.
Okay,

156
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:46.350
I'll give you a hint.
This plots are of FIFA,
which is,

157
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.420
this is the probability of reflection.
Okay.

158
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.780
What happens after,
I don't know if I would just extrapolate what would happen.

159
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.550
That's not 1.5 but two what would I measure?

160
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.990
I think it would be something like the very least minus.
All right.

161
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.320
It's going upwards,
but it will be at least three.

162
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.540
I don't know about you,

163
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.520
but I don't know problem about probabilities that can be larger than one.
Right?

164
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:21.750
So this would give me some fishery results if I would substitute something like

165
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.790
that.
Uh,

166
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.830
so let's try to shed some more light on what if I have a vacuum vacuum

167
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.640
interactions.
So below I don't have glass anymore.

168
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.230
I have vacuum.
Well,

169
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.930
a index of refraction off vacuum is long.

170
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.180
So let's just substitute one here.

171
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.910
So this is going to be zero and I'm going to have the second term,

172
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.230
one minus cosign of theater to the fifth.
Why?

173
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.200
Because this is zero and this is one minus zero.

174
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:57.550
So I will keep this tart.
Okay.
Engineering mode.

175
00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.560
What do we expect from this plot?

176
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.240
I have vacuum or air if you wish,
if you will.

177
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.720
<v 1>And Becky.
Okay.</v>

178
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.770
<v 0>I started may of life.
What will happen</v>

179
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
<v 1>with</v>

180
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.640
<v 0>probability of walk,
reflection or refraction?</v>

181
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.230
<v 1>Raise your hand if you know</v>

182
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.240
<v 0>there should be the reflection.
Exactly why.</v>

183
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.750
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

184
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.440
<v 0>exactly.
So the definition of vacuum is,
again,
nothing.</v>

185
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.730
There's nothing in there,
there's nothing that could reflect the slide.

186
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.230
This ray of light back.

187
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.150
If there's vacuum with expect rays of light to travel in vacuum indefinitely,

188
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.250
there's no way that it could be reflected.

189
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.970
So since our zero is the probability of that list are a,

190
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.530
sorry,
our data,
what do I think this should be?

191
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.010
If there's only refraction than Desarro,
Thedo will be

192
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.840
fantastic.
Okay,
well let's,
let's plot this.

193
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:10.380
This looks like one minus because scientists up to the fifth.

194
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.710
This is already efficient,
but that's the globe,
uh,
blah,
blah,
blah.

195
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:18.820
This is what I've been talking about.
So I expected it to be zero.
Uh,

196
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.080
let's plot it.
And this looks like this,
which is,

197
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.640
uh,
not constant.
Zero by any stretch.

198
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.470
So the question is,
what went terribly wrong here?

199
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.600
And it's very easy.
The sleek approximation is an approximation.

200
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.390
It's good for interfaces,

201
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:45.391
which are vacuum or air and something and not something,

202
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:50.570
something.
Okay,
so a and B,
it works well,
but it's,

203
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.600
it's a quick approximation because this is the original [inaudible] equation and

204
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.850
this is much more expensive to compute.
And this other one was much bigger,

205
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.180
but it's,
it's a bit limited in use.
So

206
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.230
let's give it a crack.
So,
uh,

207
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.610
what would they say about the vacuum back in interaction?
Well,

208
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.750
uh,
I would substitute Antwan and then two equals one.

209
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:20.760
This is the index of refraction of vacuum.
Again,

210
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.660
the very same thing back,
just the handle once and then tools are gone.

211
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.360
I'm going to use chicken and metric identity,

212
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.550
which says that the square root of one minus the sinus square something is a per

213
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.500
side.
Okay.
So let's start it to these four.

214
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.200
The consigns got it.

215
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.650
So when I see here is the sign of feet on my just cosign theater.

216
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:49.360
So what is this expression exactly?
How much is it?
Eight zero.
Exactly.

217
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.310
And this is what I was expecting.
So apparently physicists,
again,

218
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.780
are smart people.
