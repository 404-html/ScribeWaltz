WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.020
Yeah,

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.210
<v 1>no,
let's jump back to recursion.</v>

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.130
So if I would like to compute multiple bounces,
I need to handle this somehow.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.310
And we have talked about this briefly.

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.650
If I intersect the first object,

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.860
I need to reflect the rate off of this object in some way.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.410
And after the shading is done,

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.230
if you specular MBN shading them,
we can trace the light further.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630
And this chasing step can be both reflection and refraction.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.370
You remember finance law and snail slow.

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.530
We are going to put them in in use in a second.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.070
But what I need to tell you is something's super weird,

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.410
but you won't feel why this is weird.
So either a tracer,

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.880
recursive ray tracer,
global illumination,

15
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.450
the indirect in relation and these goodies that we're going to start next sector

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.100
in the ray tracer.

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.350
If you encounter and mirror the ideal specular reflector,

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.830
you will balance the way back in the ideal reflection direction.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.310
So we exactly what you would see in the mirror.
It's 35 degrees.

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.370
It is 45 degrees back and you do the same with diffuse surfaces as well.

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.880
So you continue the [inaudible] in Ideo deflection direction and now the sound

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.350
reasonably okay.

23
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.460
But when you were studying global illumination and how the whole thing is done,

24
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.810
how real men compute the rendering equation and images,

25
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.410
you will see that this is a super,

26
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.540
super huge simplification.

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.800
I remember the faces of students when they think back,

28
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:45.690
when they know all about global elimination of,

29
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.500
you're talking about simple reverse it for you,
Tracy.
And I asked them,

30
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:51.730
how is this reflected?

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.820
And there's silence because they,

32
00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.821
you know that in wobbly elimination is going to be so natural that the DFU

33
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.740
surface means okay,

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.390
that it will reflect light in every direction with the very same probability.

35
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.860
So the perfect reflection direction has the same probability as coming back the

36
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.100
same direction.
Wait,
enter the surface.

37
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.920
They all have the same probability all directions,

38
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.500
and then suddenly a ray tracers faster.

39
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.500
Even a diffuse object I'm going to treat as in Europe.

40
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.230
So this is going to be super weird.

41
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.960
And please do remember when I say this later on,

42
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:32.690
if you take a look at Ray tracers after global elimination.

43
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.360
No.
How'd the recursion,
Brooke,
I hit something.

44
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.620
I reflect the road [inaudible] he chose her,

45
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.810
arose the perfect reflection direction and I moved to restart the whole process.

46
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:49.390
I'm going to start to trace a new rate that starts on the object.

47
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.800
Remember this is when you get the staff intersection tico zero.

48
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980
I incremented this maps maximum depth value to show how many balances I have so

49
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.310
far and let's start again.
So I started to new way.

50
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.720
I imagined that this object is now the camera and this is whether literally

51
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.800
starting from
is there a question or,
okay,

52
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.570
so we got everything called does it look like in terms of mathematics,

53
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.840
the sister illumination equation without repercussion.

54
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.730
But now I need to add one more term.
Let's quickly recap this.

55
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.580
The first term is the ambient term.

56
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.000
This just to warm up the completely black shadows.

57
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.440
This is basically a bunch of hacks,
but that looks good.

58
00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:38.720
So we are going to be okay with this for now.

59
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.990
Then we scaled the amount of incoming light with the material properties.

60
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.540
So diffuse and the specular shading model.

61
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.230
These are weighted by Katie and chaos.
This,

62
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:56.180
these are values that tell you how to use this

63
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.000
object.
And not only how of it is,

64
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.370
but what colors does it absorb?
What colors does it

65
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.593
<v 0>reflect?</v>

66
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.460
<v 1>So what is the color of the object?</v>

67
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:13.810
What is diffused and specular Obito of the object.
I'm using so many terms,

68
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.120
not because I'm inconsistent,

69
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.110
but because people use all of these terms and therefore you should be familiar

70
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:20.890
with this.

71
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.820
And there's some weird stuff that I now added and this is the recursion part.

72
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.380
So Katie is the front out transmission coefficient.

73
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.680
This is the probability of refraction because you remember that I hit this aired

74
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.090
last interface from different directions and if I hit them from different

75
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:44.470
directions than the probability of reflection and refraction is different.

76
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.160
So depending on the incoming direction,

77
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.190
you have seen this loser is stronger in one direction than the other.

78
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.040
And we have to account for this with this transmission coefficient.

79
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.240
And the it is the intensity that is coming from that direction.

80
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.270
The Kr and I are,
or the other way around.

81
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.510
So if there is reflection refraction that I'm very to go in that direction

82
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.560
and I'm going to scale this with the intensity of the incoming lights from the

83
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:19.460
reflection direction.

84
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.530
A quick example when if I have a glass that's blue,

85
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.190
so some kind of glass that that looks almost entirely blue,

86
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.160
done this for now transmission coefficient is going to describe the collar

87
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.190
that's bluish.

88
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.280
Therefore all the energy that comes through this ball is going to be colored to

89
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:43.954
blue

90
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.690
and the final reflection coefficient can be whatever.

91
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.450
So we are now interested in that transmission.

92
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.100
So this is how I can define materials like that.
This is the recursion part.

93
00:05:56.101 --> 00:06:01.101
And for this I need to start perhaps multiple rates.

94
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.990
So if I hate this object and I say,
Hey,
but this is a transmissive object,

95
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.450
this is grass,
what do I do?

96
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.440
Because there is a probably the positive probably to usually for reflection or

97
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.620
refraction.
Do I start to recursions who I started two new race,

98
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.340
what do I do exactly?
And then the assignment about going to talk about,
uh,

99
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.110
you will see a piece of code that does something and then you will see the

100
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.320
effect of something.
I'm not going to spoil it.

101
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.000
And just a quick introduction to help personal [inaudible].

102
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.920
This is important because if you know this kind of notation,

103
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
then you will be able to discuss what kind of ray tracing algorithm can render

104
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.280
what kind of flight paths.
So as I started school,

105
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.590
all light paths go between light sources and the eye.

106
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.890
If it doesn't hit,
if it doesn't hit the lens of the camera,

107
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.840
it's not going to be recorded in the image.
So every light source is,

108
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.350
every light path is going to be written as owl,
something,

109
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:11.240
something II or as this is by reaction or you can imagine the other way around.

110
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:13.820
So you can see he something,
something else.

111
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.680
The denote was one diffuse into reflection during the way as is one specular

112
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:23.030
into reflection during the way.

113
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.100
And the asterisk means any amount of diffuse bouncers,

114
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.300
perhaps even zero.

115
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.540
So LD he means that either I hit that the eye from the light immediately or

116
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:42.230
there is one diffuse balance or maybe an arbitrary number of the few spouses.

117
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.260
This is what the asterisk tells you and we can also denote the choice.

118
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
The choice means that there is only one either specular or one diffuse spots and

119
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:56.120
with this smell,
that parcel notation,

120
00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.440
we can discuss all the algorithms there are to render photorealistic quality

121
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:01.274
images.

122
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.650
So for now some of this will be intuitive,

123
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:10.490
some of this will be not so intuitive because we don't know global illumination

124
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.180
yet,

125
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.160
but first recasting means that we hit at most one diffuse object.

126
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:20.810
That's all it can render,
no recursion,
nothing.
I just hit one diffuse object.

127
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.140
I do the diffuse shading and Dubai radio city can compute something like

128
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.370
indirect illumination because multiple diffuse balances are possible.

129
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:33.170
So remember the example,

130
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740
the light comes in to the classroom through the window wall and then you see

131
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:42.790
over and therefore the ombre is not going to be perfectly blunt.

132
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.880
This is called indirect in relation radio city Scott.

133
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.670
That covered recursive ray tracing.

134
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:54.110
What we are doing with this final transmission and reflection thing.

135
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.790
We know that what we can do is indirect illumination,

136
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:04.791
definitely not because we treat a diffuse object also as a mirror,

137
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.100
we just use a different shading function for it.

138
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.340
So we don't trace rays allow the hemisphere of the object because it collects

139
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:18.630
light from every direction.
This is why it doesn't change.
If I move my head,

140
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.920
this is why the sight of it doesn't change,
but we cannot account for that.

141
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.090
This would be a huge dimensional integration problem that we're going to solve

142
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.810
in the rendering equation.
So atmos one diffuse balance,

143
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.370
but you may have as many specular balances as far as you need.

144
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.040
So this is why,

145
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.100
because if ray tracers usually show you mirrors and glass balls and reflective

146
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.981
things like that because it is capable of rendering it that not so much more and

147
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.070
global illumination,

148
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:54.420
that's the full package and arbitrary number of diffused or specular dances.

149
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.130
This can also be glossy.

150
00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:00.220
Whatever kind of complicated material model you have here.
This,

151
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.500
the ask can be anything.
And in any amount,
what,

152
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.510
let's take a look at an example with the Hagberg notation.

153
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.980
So here we have life paths and they start out from the light source.

154
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.930
So on the right I have something like LDD.

155
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.160
That's exactly what I have been talking about.
So I start from the lighthouse.

156
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.070
I hit a diffuse wall,
I hit the diffuse ground,

157
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.250
and then I hit the camera afterwards.
So that's led.

158
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.540
Let's take a look at for instance,
our S.
S.
E.

159
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.640
So I start from the light source.
I hit the glass ball from the outside,

160
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.830
this left glass ball,

161
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.960
and then I go inside the boulders stern to be reflection at least.

162
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.960
Let's imagine that there's going to be earth refraction.

163
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.980
And then I hit it on the other side as well and they come out.

164
00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.180
So this is two specular balances,
l.
S.
S.
E.

165
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.930
So we can denote flight paths and understand what are the rhythms can render

166
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:09.770
what exactly.
So here,
if we imagine that this is a ray tracer,

167
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.570
this is an image with the ray tracer.

168
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.760
The question is what did they do?

169
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.150
And this is a rather low quality image,
but let's,

170
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.780
it seems to me that the shadows are not completely black.

171
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.940
Therefore in their shading novels,
they definitely use the what kind of term?

172
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.890
Raise your hand if you know the answer.

173
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.390
Okay.
That's still not too many.

174
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.570
So normally this would be completely black because I showed a shadow read

175
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.260
towards the light source and it is going to be uprooted by the table.

176
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.630
So intensity zero,

177
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.310
<v 0>imagine</v>

178
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.450
<v 1>that like all possible shadow race are blocked,</v>

179
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.840
but this is still not completely black because I'm having a term to it in order

180
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:06.790
to work and make the image should be organizing.
So this would be which turn,

181
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.580
this would be the ambient.
Excellent.
