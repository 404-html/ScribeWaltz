1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.650
Excellent.
So this was the heat armies.
Why hit or miss?

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:09.390
Because the ball that I throw is either below or the boss,

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.233
their function,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.760
not what we will actually use is the sample mean sample mean is different.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.240
I would like to integrate this function and I can take samples of it.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.110
Sam was here mean that I have f of x and two X.

7
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.310
I can substitute a number and I can evaluate the function there.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.580
So I don't know the integral of the functions too complicated,

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.460
but I can evaluate it.
I can evaluate it at zero,
at all points,

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.720
15 to and values like that.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.340
How do I compute the actual integral from these fashion,
from this,
these samples?

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.040
Well,
we will take a look through an extremely difficult example,

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.490
which is integrating x.
Okay,
so let's,

14
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.090
let's solve this with multiple different methods.
Method one,

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.150
what does the mathematician do?
Find a really did function.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.470
What is the primitive function of x x squared over two all we have to do is

17
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:07.430
substitute one and zero and therefore we get one half off.
Excellent.

18
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.940
So I know that I'm looking for one half.
What does the engineer do?

19
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.120
The engineer knows that this is a linear function.

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.690
Therefore this is going to be the area of a triangle.

21
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.230
What are the lengths of the triangle?

22
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.850
The base is one because I'm integrating from zero to one.
The height is also one

23
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.440
because if I go one to the right,

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.130
I'm going to go on upwards as well because this is x.

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.370
So the area of the triangle is the base times the height over two so this is one

26
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:46.370
half again.
Now we have the mathematician and the engineer.

27
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.130
What does Monte Carlo Guy Do?

28
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.580
A Monte Carlo Guy didn't study mathematics and also he can't do any of these.

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.280
So what Monte Carlo Guy is going to do is he's going to take samples of this

30
00:01:58.281 --> 00:01:59.114
function.

31
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.150
So I evaluate f of x and o 0.2 how much is it at all point to,

32
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.780
well obviously or point to sip as possible.
Example,

33
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.200
what about a low 0.4 but at o point for this is awkward for him

34
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.793
and so on.

35
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800
So I have taken four randomly chosen samples from dysfunction and this is called

36
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.400
sample beam.
This means hemorrhaging.

37
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.140
So let's take the average of all of these are the average of all of these

38
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:30.420
islands is exactly one half.

39
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.630
So this gives me the actual result for an integral than I could otherwise not

40
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.370
solve.
Now we can coat this very easily.

41
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.253
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

42
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.540
<v 0>just a few lines of code and there's already access lines of code because of</v>

43
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:53.070
printing and whatnot.
But you can,
we can see how small disease,

44
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.430
this is the actual function,

45
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:58.990
this double f that I'm interested in and f of x,

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.080
x.
So it's not really that difficult.

47
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.500
What is the output of this program?
After many samples,

48
00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:12.390
I approach direct calls to one half up to quite a few digits.

49
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.520
So this works really,
really well.

50
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.960
<v 0>But there's something really interesting about this.</v>

52
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.820
So if I draw one sample from this Intergraph

53
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.470
<v 1>yeah,</v>

54
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.410
<v 0>then I have an overestimation off the result.
Why?</v>

55
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.800
Because I'm looking for all 0.5 and I have four point in December.

56
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.220
What about 10 samples?
Is this an overestimation or underestimation?

57
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113
10 samples

58
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.040
wasn't paying attention to the sentence before because it was thinking about 10

59
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:51.800
samples.
Tickets,
dammit.
Okay.
So the question is,
is all points 61 more?
Nope,

60
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.693
I'm fine.

61
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.713
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.550
<v 0>So tell us a good approximation because it's 1.6 more than what?</v>

63
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.220
It's more than what?
Google workbook one five.
Yeah,
exactly.

64
00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.690
So this is an overestimation.

65
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.380
<v 1>Okay,</v>

66
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.870
<v 0>excellent.
What about 100 samples with happy hour?</v>

67
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.370
Hopefully it's

68
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.170
almost perfect.
That's an underestimation.
Okay.

69
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:20.770
What about 1000 samples?
Who will be happy?

70
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:25.170
Well maybe may I ask her permission?
Pizza.
Her.

71
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.750
Okay.

72
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.640
Marco knows that this is an underestimation and this is a weird behavior,

73
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.031
right?

74
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:37.031
Because I have over estimations and underestimations of this interim role.

75
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.040
<v 0>But in the end it seems that they are going to,</v>

77
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.740
the deviations are going to be less and less.

78
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.730
So this almost looks like a side.
So it's like jeopardy.

79
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.280
The convergence is something like a sign of x times x,

80
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.160
is it?
No,
because it's going to get large side effects over bags.

81
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.580
So this is like a sign that starts off with large deviations of large aptitude

82
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:06.140
that it gets smaller and smaller.

83
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.940
This is how the convergence of Monte Carlo investigators goal,

84
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.810
and this we call by the way still has to convergence.

85
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.930
So it means that it can be over and under the integral,

86
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.140
but as you add more samples,
it's guaranteed to be closer.

87
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.190
Let's have another example.
Let's integrate this function two times.

88
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.540
Science Square of X.
Yeah.

89
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.330
<v 2>The function in the country,
uh,</v>

90
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.193
results were,

91
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.020
<v 0>yes,
I can do all those two samples.</v>

92
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.900
<v 2>What are the frequencies fight then you get to compete with them.</v>

93
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.440
<v 0>There's a probability to having such that once you could say that,</v>

94
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.060
yes,
this can happen.
One,

95
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.360
that this has very low power because why would you keep the same region over and

96
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.194
over again?

97
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.270
And you can also do smart things.

98
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.610
Slide like putting a grid on the function and sampling that.
So that's,

99
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.444
that's one thing.

100
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.673
<v 1>But</v>

101
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.620
<v 0>what you will see later that we'll have unbiased estimators and this means that</v>

102
00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:22.830
you can expect the error to shrink in time,

103
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.540
but this will be a couple lectures down the line.

104
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.280
This is everything fine regarding that.
That wasn't going be mark,

105
00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:35.500
that's exactly how it goes.
Okay.
What does the mathematician guy,

106
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:37.980
I do look for primitive functions.
Excellent.

107
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.220
What is the primitive function for the science part of x?
What?

108
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.170
It's one half of x minus the assigned times the cold side.

109
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.350
Let's do the actual substitution.
We have our and Pie and apple.

110
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.520
What as the engineer do or these are not triangles anymore.

111
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.230
So you better look it up on

112
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.540
more from off phone and you ain't got something like this.

113
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.520
And there is all these again pie.
So wonderful engineering works.

114
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.030
Okay.
What does Monte Carlo,

115
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.260
I do Monte Carlo Chi doesn't the war from Alpha doesn't know math,

116
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.360
mathematics that doesn't know anything.

117
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:17.310
But this hat he has his 20 whatever line c pass pass program.

118
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.950
<v 1>Okay,</v>

119
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.610
<v 0>let's take samples of this.
What are we looking for?
What was the number?</v>

120
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.110
What was the end result?
Because pot.
Okay,

121
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.820
so let's substitute dysfunction.
Where this double f is now,

122
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.400
uh,
the science corner of X.

123
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.060
And I have also this multiplier of two in line 35.

124
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.050
So this on the right side,
you see that this is what I'm looking for.

125
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.790
This is what we have changed.
Not just one more time.
What?

126
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.150
What am I looking for?
What would be the perfect result?

127
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.430
Okay,
excellent.

128
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.840
And they run this program and it starts out maybe three dyl 3.6 okay.

129
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.140
And as I add more samples,
I would get one

130
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.140
<v 1>up high.
I get one.</v>

131
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.270
<v 0>Okay.
So I have been lying to you.</v>

132
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.940
I have been lying to you all along.

133
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:20.941
This doesn't work at all and we don't have the slightest idea why this doesn't

134
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:22.024
work.

135
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.050
That's one of the most important lessons during this course.
Not,

136
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.110
not because of this thing.
Who Cares?
We'll pull,

137
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.220
study this thing and then sorted out.
But you start out,

138
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.750
if you have a difficult problem,

139
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.650
you start out trying to understand it with your intuition.

140
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.780
You don't start throwing multidimensional in Nicole's everywhere.

141
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:47.740
You start out thinking of what is going on.
Then there is a diffuse interaction.

142
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.080
There is scattering in the advocacy.

143
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.880
How does it look like you use your intuition and your intuition can get you very

144
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.090
so in the integration of this f of x,
the intuition of the sample mean could,

145
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.530
could get us the perfect solution.

146
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.130
There may be more complicated cases where your intuition fails.

147
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.700
And this doesn't mean that intuition is not useful,

148
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.960
but it means that he can only take you so far.
So if you,

149
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.560
if you have barriers like this that you cannot go through intuition,

150
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.160
Dan is the point when you start using mathematics and you start to evaluate what

151
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.850
is going on.
You start to look at the details.

152
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.750
So use the intuition to get an idea of what's going on.

153
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.020
And then if you run into obstacles,

154
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.600
use mathematics to sort out the details.

155
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.140
That's one of the most important lessons out there for you when you will go out

156
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:50.720
there and try to study really complicated theories.

157
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.240
<v 1>Okay,</v>

158
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.330
<v 0>so this doesn't work.
I have been lying to you all along.</v>

159
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.920
How can we sort it out?
Well,

160
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.950
after the commercials with a little bit more,

161
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.000
the commercial will come in the form of Tomas.

162
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.640
<v 0>Because,
uh,</v>

164
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.990
he is going to travel to Japan for a house a year long,

165
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.440
half year long research project.
So he has a few lectures left,

166
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.700
three,
all of them in particular.

167
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.830
And he has to hold them now because he's going to take the plane afterwards.

168
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.040
So the next three lectures are going to be held by thoughts and uh,

169
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.170
I mean the timing is a bit suboptimal because I have to cut this lecturer in

170
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:39.004
halls.

171
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.050
That's at least you know how Monte Carlo Integration Works and he is going to

172
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:46.400
tell you more about this.

173
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.150
And then we will complete the student and at the end of this unit.

174
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.720
So before I get too complicated,
three lectures from Thomas,

175
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.270
then I come back,

176
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.350
we complete this lecture will be know how to ride the global illumination

177
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.080
program.
So this is exactly what we were going to do.

178
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.070
I have implemented the whole global illumination.
Think it is beautiful.

179
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.510
It's kind of everything.
It can be too beautiful.
Indirect elimination costings.

180
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.490
I think it's in 250 lines.
It's readable,
it's understandable.
And many,

181
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.300
many people have learned how to a limitation from this program.

182
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.670
So after three lectures from Thomas,
then I finish this.
That's one lecture.

183
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.160
The next section is going to be a cold through.
So we are going to take into,
uh,

184
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.570
we are getting our news through the cold.
What I have really,
how this works.

185
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.360
How is front of House Law in sergeant here?
Where do I use house long?

186
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.530
How do I do all these things?
You will see everything in Code.

187
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.280
It's going to be very practical.

188
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>
