1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.820
Terrorism is very scary,

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.110
especially when it happens close to home and not in some far away place.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.580
Nobody likes to be afraid and we were eager to make the fear go away,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.930
so we demanded more security in the last decade.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.010
It's become increasingly normal for civil liberties to be eroded and for

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.570
government agencies to spy on citizens to collect and store their personal

7
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.950
information.
Regardless of whether you're a fan of right or left wing policies.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.630
This affects every one of us,

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.860
so we have to take a look at the data and ask ourselves honestly,

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.440
has all of this actually made us safer?

11
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.000
In the aftermath of nine 11 the u s government concluded that the law had not

12
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.260
kept pace with technology.

13
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.580
It created the terrorist surveillance program initially to intercept

14
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.790
communications linked to al Qaeda officials.

15
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:04.000
We're confident that if the program had been in place before nine 11 the

16
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.530
hijackers could have been stopped,

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.000
but soon the new powers were also used to prove guilt by association.

18
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.430
The FBI used immigration records to identify Arab Muslim foreign nationals in

19
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.990
the u s on their spaces.
80,000 individuals were required to register.

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.770
Another 8,000 were called in for FBI interviews and more than 5,000 locked up in

21
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:25.750
preventive detention.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.010
Not One terrorist was found in what's been called the most aggressive national

23
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:35.011
campaign of ethnic profiling since world war two how colon pace it's since

24
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.530
become for government agencies to collect and store the personal data of

25
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.440
citizens was made plain by the leak of the Snowden documents.

26
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.440
In 2013 they showed how the NSE can demand information about users from firms

27
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:48.160
like Microsoft or Google.

28
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000
In addition to that daily collection of data from civilian internet traffic such

29
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.130
as email content and contact lists.

30
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.070
So instead of focusing on criminals,

31
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.880
governments are increasingly turning their attention to everyone.

32
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.940
But if you're looking for a needle in a haystack,

33
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.780
adding more hay to the stack isn't going to make it any easier to find the

34
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:09.640
needle.
On the contrary,

35
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.730
every recent success announced by the NSA has come from classic targets

36
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.000
surveillance,
despite high hopes,

37
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.510
the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any major terror attack.

38
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.310
For instance,
one of the Boston marathon bombers was already a target of the FBI.

39
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.510
So what we need is not even more random data,

40
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.050
but better ways to understand and use the information we have.

41
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.040
Spy agencies are also pushing to cripple encryption.

42
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.230
In early 2016 the FBI asks apple to produce her backdoor program to disabled the

43
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.850
encryption of a terrorist.
Iphone.

44
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.110
Apple publicly declined not only because there's tool could be used to

45
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.380
permanently weakened the privacy of law abiding citizens worldwide,

46
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.920
but a fair into open the floodgates for governments requesting access to a

47
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:58.720
technology used by billions of people,
a fair shared by security experts,

48
00:02:58.721 --> 00:02:59.554
and

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.750
a few weeks later the FBI revealed that they had had the phone themselves

50
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.320
basically admitting that they lied to the public about the need for a backdoor.

51
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.730
Which questions?

52
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.720
How trustworthy spy agencies are in the debate about privacy and security,

53
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.690
especially considering that the NSA,
for example,

54
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.770
already has the capability to turn on your iPhone microphone or activate your

55
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.840
laptop camera without you noticing.

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.460
Concerns about this are often met with the argument.
If you have nothing to hide,

57
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.900
you have nothing to fear that this reasoning only creates a climate of

58
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.470
oppression wanting to keep certain parts of your life private.

59
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.210
It doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong right now.
We live in a democracy,

60
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.890
but imagine the damage the wrong person could do with all our data and such.

61
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.540
Easy access to our devices.

62
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.520
Antiterrorism laws allow the authorities to investigate and punish and lawn

63
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:53.830
terrorism related crimes more aggressively.

64
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.700
If you give law enforcement powerful tools,
they will use them.

65
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.880
That's why democratic oversight is so important.

66
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.880
Even if those tools and laws aren't used against you today,

67
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.860
they might meet tomorrow.
For example,
following the November,

68
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.810
2015 Paris attacks,
France expanded.

69
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.770
It's already extensive antiterrorism laws by giving law enforcement greater

70
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.270
powers to conduct house rate and pace people under house arrest.
Within weeks,

71
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.410
evidence emerged that these powers were being used for unintended purposes such

72
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:27.550
as causing climate change protests.
The governments of Spain,

73
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.210
Hungary and Poland have introduced more restrictive laws on the freedom of

74
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.850
assembly and speech,
freedom of expression,

75
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.960
and the press in Turkey has been seriously undermined in the last few years with

76
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.870
people sentenced to prison for criticizing the government.

77
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.470
None of this is effectively helping us fight terrorism.

78
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.400
The motivation behind this might be good,
even noble,

79
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.730
but if we let our elected governments limit our personal freedom,

80
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.140
the terrorists are winning.
What's worse?
If we're not careful,

81
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.990
we might slowly move towards a surveillance state.

82
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.540
The data is pretty clear.

83
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.220
The erosion of rights along with mass surveillance hasn't led to significant

84
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:10.120
successes so far,
but it has changed the nature of our society.

85
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.580
Terrorism is a complicated problems.
Without simple solutions,

86
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.050
no security operators can prevent a few guys from building a bomb in that

87
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:23.890
basement.
We should keep the principle of proportionality in mind.

88
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.570
Creating master keys to enter millions of phones is not the same as searching a

89
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:31.240
single house in most countries.

90
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.820
The law already permits a wide range of actions,

91
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.990
including targeted surveillance to take full advantage of this existing

92
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:38.650
potential.

93
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.060
We need better international corporation and more effective security and foreign

94
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.933
policies,

95
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.550
better application of our present laws instead of new and stricter ones that

96
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.240
undermine our freedom.
Let us not out of fear,

97
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.400
destroy what we are most proud of,

98
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.370
democracy and our fundamental and the parties.
