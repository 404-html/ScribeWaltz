1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Hold around the world is marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legal,

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.930
but is this really a good idea?
In the online debate,

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.270
the harmful sites are often downplayed,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.040
so let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.410
argument.
Number one,
in the last few decades,

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.700
marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent.
Today,

7
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:36.960
marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause

8
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.250
psychosis.
The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC,

9
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.490
and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis regardless of other

10
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.364
risk factors.

11
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.590
Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract for as a

12
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.424
fax.

13
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.020
It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety,

14
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.240
but because it doesn't make you high,

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.370
growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana of the last few

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.770
decades while increasing THC levels.

17
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
Sample testing showed the THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to

18
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:19.071
nearly 12% in 2014 shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from one to 14 in 1995 to

19
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.661
about one two 80 and 2014 it's unclear how precise those tests were.

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.523
However,

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.120
overall recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the

22
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.690
stronger it is,
the higher your risk of developing psychosis.

23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.890
But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?

24
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.480
A study from Brett and found that while marijuana use has risen significantly

25
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:50.481
between 1996 and 2005 the number of schizophrenia cases a type of psychosis

26
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.890
remain stable.

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.080
The risk of marijuana and juice psychosis remains the highest for people who

28
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:02.100
already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with.
For them,

29
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.120
it seems more lifey that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition

30
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.160
rather than causing it.
As far as we know right now,
so the reasoning goes,

31
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.590
if fewer people have access to marijuana,

32
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.560
the lower the risk of marijuana and juice psychosis.

33
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.210
But actually you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal,

34
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.820
more people will end up with psychosis.

35
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.890
Prohibition makes a legal drug stronger and more potions because this way you

36
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:32.970
can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profits.

37
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.500
This is what happened during the Prohibition of alcohol and the u s where hard

38
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.310
liquor became the norm and the same is happening with marijuana.

39
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.080
Now imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available.

40
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.370
You have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than

41
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:54.840
you would like to.
This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today.

42
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.410
People didn't stop drinking during prohibition and the numbers show that laws

43
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.300
don't deter people from using marijuana.
We can't make marijuana go away,

44
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.260
but we can make it safer.
If marijuana were legal,

45
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.700
there would be more options for consumers and regulators could,
for example,

46
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.040
insist on a high level of CBD,

47
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.000
just like most people don't drink and after work bottle of vodka,

48
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.410
many people would gladly consume the after work beer version of marijuana.

49
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.140
Argument to marijuana is a gateway drug.
If it's legalized,

50
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.680
there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs.

51
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.180
A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other

52
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.530
illegal drug.
At some point,

53
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.100
legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend.

54
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.960
As more young people try legal marijuana,
they might end up trying harder drugs,

55
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.680
but it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much ellia cigarettes.

56
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.750
One study showed the teens who started smoking before the age of 15 we're 80%

57
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.570
more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't.

58
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200
And a 2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked with three

59
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:12.850
times more likely to binge drink,

60
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.960
seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine.

61
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.680
And we're also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana.

62
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.080
But if that's the case,

63
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.400
how could making more drugs legal stomp the use of hard drugs?

64
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.990
At first,

65
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.590
it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because that legal or

66
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.940
not,
if you want to buy any drug,
you'll always find someone happy to sell.

67
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.310
The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs

68
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.144
at all?

69
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.160
Studies show that set conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and

70
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:51.490
addiction,
a difficult childhood,
early trauma,

71
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.870
low social status,
depression,
even genetic factors,

72
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.940
which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance.

73
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.350
Addicts take drugs to escape that problems,

74
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.850
but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problem,

75
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.960
but punishing people for that unhealthy coping mechanisms.

76
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.110
It doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either.

77
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.680
So some argue we need to take a completely different route and 2001 Portugal had

78
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.990
one of the worst drug problems in Europe,

79
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.570
so it was desperate enough to try something.

80
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.490
Radical possession and use of all illegal drugs was decriminalized.

81
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.250
You would no longer be arrested.
Instead,

82
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.830
or authorities launched a major health campaign,

83
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.620
people who were found with a small amount,

84
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:45.070
we're referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm

85
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:49.420
reduction.
Drug use was seen as a chronic disease,
not a crime.

86
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.790
The results were stunning.

87
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.390
The number of people who try drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 8% by

88
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.300
2012 the use of hard drugs decreased as what?

89
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.301
As HIV and hepatitis infections and overdoses making drugs legal might overall

90
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.480
helps society much more than it harms it.

91
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.450
Argument number three,
marijuana is addictive and unhealthy.

92
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.020
It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum.

93
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.640
While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical,

94
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.260
it is still a real problem.

95
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.600
The demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the

96
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.430
past decade alone and total about 10% of people who try marijuana will become

97
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.330
addicted.
This is also related to higher THC levels.

98
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.760
A study released in 2017 track the potency of marijuana and Dutch coffee shops

99
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.820
over a period of 16 years for every 1% increase in THC,

100
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.950
60 more people and to treatment nationwide.

101
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.560
In terms of negative health effects,

102
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.730
some studies linked marijuana use to increase blood pressure and lung problems.

103
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.680
While a 2016 study found that marijuana use was unrelated to physical health

104
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:09.620
problems except for a high risk of gum disease.

105
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.170
Some studies show that marijuana use auteurs teenagers brains and decreases

106
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.010
their intelligence,

107
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.610
but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account,

108
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.900
the results were inconclusive.
Overall,

109
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:27.770
research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is

110
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:28.604
bad for you,

111
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.560
but the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana res,

112
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.040
we need more funding for research,
which is hard to get.

113
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.690
While marijuana remains illegal.

114
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.300
We can put what we know into perspective though 16% of people who consume

115
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:49.301
alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokers.

116
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.080
We know for sure alcohol affects your brain,
destroys your liver,

117
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.490
and causes cancer.
While tobacco clogs your arteries,
destroys your lungs,

118
00:07:58.491 --> 00:07:59.960
and also causes cancer.

119
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.430
3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each chair,

120
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.310
while smoking kills more than 6 million people.

121
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.380
Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol or harm.
This just because their legal.

122
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.520
Also,

123
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.750
nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely

124
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:22.700
dangerous.
The Gannett is a way to exercise some control over them,

125
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.400
especially when it comes to protecting young people.

126
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.500
It's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal
ones.

127
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.270
Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to

128
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.110
underage kids legality and creates incentives.

129
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.510
Here the drug dealers can't exploit.

130
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.270
So making marijuana legal doesn't mean in dosing it.

131
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.840
It means taking responsibility for the risks that poses.

132
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.560
It could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how

133
00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:00.300
harmful it really is and to whom
conclusion,

134
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.440
marijuana is a drug and just like any other drug,

135
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.190
it has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it is

136
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.410
he is not harmless.

137
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.320
The best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be

138
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.450
legalization and regulation,
