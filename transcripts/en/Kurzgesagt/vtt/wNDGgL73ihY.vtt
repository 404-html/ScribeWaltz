1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.380
The beginning of everything.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.770
The Big Bang is the idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.200
out to the middle of the 20th century.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.470
Most scientists thought of the universe as infinite and ageless until Einstein's

5
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.450
theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of gravity and Edwin Hubble

6
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:26.440
discovered the galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that fits

7
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:31.120
previous predictions.
In 1964 by accident,

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.560
cosmic background radiation was discovered,
a relic of the early universe,

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.340
which together with other observational evidence made the big bang.

10
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:44.341
The accepted theory in science since then improved technology like the Hubble

11
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:48.400
telescope has given us a pretty good picture of the Big Bang and the structure

12
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:49.234
of the cosmos.

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.310
Recent observations even seem to suggest that the expansion of the universe is

14
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:58.060
accelerating,
but how did this big bang work?

15
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.160
How can something come from nothing?
Let's explore what we know

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.820
we can ignore.
The beginning part for now,
first of all,

17
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.610
the big bang was not an explosion.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.300
It was all space stretching everywhere all at once.

19
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.090
The universe started very,
very,

20
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:26.540
very small and quickly expanded to the size of a football.

21
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.540
The device didn't expand into it.

22
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:32.870
I think space was just expanding into itself.

23
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.350
The universe cannot expand into it.

24
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.850
I think because the university has no borders.

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
There is by definition no outside the universe.

26
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.480
The Universe is all there is and this hot,

27
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.950
dense environment energy manifested itself in particles that existed only for

28
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.100
the tiniest glimpses of time from blue ons,

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.690
powers of quarks or created which destroyed one another perhaps after giving off

30
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:58.524
more glue arms.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
These found other short lift quarks to interact with forming new quark pass and

32
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:07.800
glue.
Once again,
matter and energy.
We're not just theoretically equivalent.

33
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.310
It was so hot.
They were practically the same stuff.

34
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.690
So where around this time matter,
one over anti matter.

35
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.920
Today we're left with almost all matter and nearly no anti matter at all.

36
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
Somehow 1,000,000,001 matter particles were formed for every 1 billion particles

37
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:30.510
of anti matter instead of one massive ultimate force in the universe.

38
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860
They were now several refined versions of it acting under different rules.

39
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.480
By now.
The universe has stretched it to a billion kilometers in diameter,

40
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.580
which leads to a decrease in temperature.

41
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200
The cycle of quarks being born and converted back to energy suddenly stops.

42
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
From now on.
We work with what we have.
Quarks begin forming.

43
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.140
New particles had Ron's like protons and neutrons.
There are many,

44
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:58.260
many combinations of quarks,
the conform,
all sorts of hydrogens,

45
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.900
but only very few are reasonably stable for any length of time.

46
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.710
Please take a moment to appreciate that.
Bye now.

47
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.460
Only one second has passed since the beginning of everything.

48
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.960
The universe which has grown to 100 billion kilometers is now cold enough to

49
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:20.370
allow most of the neutrons to decay into protons and formed the first atom

50
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.620
hydrogen.
Imagine that universe at this point has an extremely hot soup,

51
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.420
10 billion degrees Celsius filled with countless particles and energy.

52
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.070
Over the next few minutes,
things cooled and settled down very fast.

53
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.120
Atoms formed out of had Ron's and electrons making for a stable and electrically

54
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.850
neutral environment.
Some core this period,

55
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.700
the dark age because there were no stars and the hydrogen gas didn't allow

56
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.290
visible likes to move around,

57
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.190
but what's the meaning of visible light anyway when there's nothing alive yet

58
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:58.191
the could have eyes when the hydrogen gas clumped together after millions of

59
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.120
years and gravity put it under great pressure,

60
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.960
stars and galaxies began to form their radiation,

61
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:08.460
dissolve the stable hydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates the universe

62
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.630
today and allows a visible light to pass.
Finally,

63
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.750
there was light.
Okay,

64
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.740
but what about the part we didn't talk about what happened right at the

65
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:23.820
beginning.
This part can be defined as the big bang.

66
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.010
We don't know at all what happened here.

67
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.200
At this point our tools break down natural law stop making sense.

68
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.970
Time itself becomes wibbly wobbly to understand what happened here.

69
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:40.170
We need a theory that unifies Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics.

70
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.530
Something countless scientists are working on right now,

71
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.110
but this leaves us with lots of unanswered questions where their universe is

72
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.500
before our own.
Is this the first and the only universe?

73
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.540
What started the Big Bang or did it just occur naturally based on norms?

74
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:02.340
We don't understand yet.
We don't know and maybe we never will,

75
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.060
but what we do know is that the universe,
as we know it,

76
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.070
started here and gave birth to particles,
galaxies,
stars,

77
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.260
the earth,
and you,

78
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.730
since we ourselves are made of dead stars,
we are not separate from the universe.

79
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.130
We are part of it.

80
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.410
You could even say that we are the universe's way of experiencing itself.

81
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.570
So let's keep on experiencing as until there are no more questions to ask.
