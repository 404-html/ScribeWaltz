00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.140
What would happen to you if a black hole,
the size of a coin suddenly appeared?

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:07.980
Ne You short onset,
you die.
Don't announce it.
It depends.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.550
Is it a black hole with a massive a coin or is it as wide as a coin?

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.390
Supposedly us nickel with a massive about five grams magic,

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.950
he collapsed into a black hole.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
This black hole would have a radius of 10 to power of minus 30 meters.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.500
By comparison,
a hundred anatomy is about 10 to the power of minus 11 meters,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.240
so the black hole compared to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the
sun.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
Unimaginably small and a small black hole would also have an unimaginably short

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.420
lifetime to decay by hawking radiation.
It would radiate a,
wait,
what little mass?

11
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.630
It has intent,
the power of minus 23 seconds.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
It's five grams of last will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy,

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.110
which will lead to an explosion roughly three times bigger than the atomic bombs

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.
In this case you die.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.150
You also lose the coin.
If the black hole had the diameter of a common coin,

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.120
then it would be considerably more massive.
In fact,

17
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.900
of a black hole with the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more massive

18
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:10.650
than the earth.
It would have a surface gravity,
a billion,

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.960
billion times greater than our planet currently does.

20
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.910
It's tidal forces on you will be so strong that they'd rip your individual cells

21
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.630
apart.

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.350
The black hole would consume you before you even realized what's happening.

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.750
Although the laws of gravity are still the same,

24
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.530
the phenomenon of gravity that you'd experience would be very different around

25
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:29.910
such dense objects.

26
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.630
The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire observable

27
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.520
universe.
With gravity getting weaker.

28
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.790
The farther away you are from something on earth right now,

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.570
your head and your toes are approximately the same distance from the center of

30
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.810
our planet,
but if you stood on a nickel size black hole,

31
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.620
your feet would be hundreds of times closer to the center and the gravitational

32
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.910
force would be tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and

33
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.200
wrap you into a billion pieces,
but the black hole wouldn't stop with just you.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.910
The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the Earth Moon black

35
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:04.050
hole of death system.

36
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.860
You might think that the black hole would sink towards the center of the planet

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.010
and consume it from the inside out.
In fact,

38
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.270
the earth also moves up onto the black hole and begins to bop around as if it

39
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:19.230
were orbiting the black hole or while having swaves of mass eaten with each
pass,

40
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.550
which is much more creepy.
As the earth is eaten up from the inside,

41
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.750
it collapses into a scattered disc of hot rock surrounding the back hold in a

42
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.650
title bit.
The black holes slowly doubles its mass by the time it's done.

43
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.950
Feeding the moon's orbit is now highly elliptical.

44
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
The effects on the solar system are awesome in the biblical sense of awesome,

45
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.130
which means terrifying tidal forces from the black hole would probably disrupt

46
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.210
the narrow earth asteroids.

47
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.140
Maybe even parts of the asteroid belt sending rocks could reading through the

48
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:54.141
solar system bombardment and impacts may become common pays for the next few

49
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.600
million years.

50
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.350
The planets are slightly perturbed but stay approximately in the same orbit.

51
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.680
The black hole we used to call earth will now continue on orbiting the sun in

52
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.800
the ass place.
In this case you will say die.

53
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.920
