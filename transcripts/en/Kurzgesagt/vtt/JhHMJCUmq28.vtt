00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.230
For most of our history.
Human technology consisted of our brains,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.410
fire and sharp sticks while fire and sharp sticks became power plants and

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.254
nuclear weapons.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
The biggest upgrade has happened to our brains since the 1960s the power of our

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.760
brain machines has kept growing exponentially,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.870
allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.590
But this process is about to meet it's physical limits.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.770
Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.880
To understand why this is a problem,
we have to clear up some basics.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things,

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.540
representing data,
the means of processing it and control mechanisms.

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
Computer chips contain modules which contain logic gates which contain

13
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:53.994
transistors.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.470
A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers.

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.030
Basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming

16
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.864
through.

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.580
This information is made up of bits which can be set to either zero or one.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.020
Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.

19
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
Transistors are combined to create logic gates,
which still do very simple stuff.

20
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.133
For example,

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.060
an and gate sends an output of one if all of its inputs are one and an output of

22
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:27.180
zero.
Otherwise combinations of logic gates.

23
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.370
Finally form meaningful modules say for adding two numbers.
Once you can add,

24
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.930
you can also multiply and once you can multiply you can basically do anything.

25
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.070
Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math.

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.270
You can imagine a computer as a group of seven year olds answering really basic

27
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.110
math questions.

28
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.730
A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.

29
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.760
However,
with parts getting Tinier and Tinier,

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.480
quantum physics are making things tricky.
In a nutshell,

31
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.880
a transistor is just an electric switch.

32
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.180
Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another.

33
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.860
So a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.

34
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.880
Today,
a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers,

35
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
which is about eight times less than the HIV virus is diameter and 500 times

36
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.540
smaller than a red blood cells.

37
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.320
As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms,

38
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.040
electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage

39
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.820
via a process called quantum tunneling.
In the quantum realm,

40
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.870
physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to and

41
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.600
traditional computers just stop making sense.

42
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress to

43
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:42.990
solve this problem.

44
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.160
Scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage

45
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.910
by building quantum computers in normal computers.

46
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:55.470
Bits are the smallest units of information.
Quantum computers use qubits,

47
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.870
which can also be set to one of two values.

48
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.890
A cubit can be any two level quantum system such as a spin in a magnetic field

49
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.730
or a single photon zero and one of their systems.

50
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.720
Possible states make the photons horizontal or vertical polarization.

51
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.650
In the quantum world,
the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those.

52
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.740
It can be in any proportions of both states at once.

53
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.930
This is called superposition,

54
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.460
but as soon as you test it's value say by sending the photon through a filter,

55
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.750
it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized,

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.180
so as long as it's unobserved.

57
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.770
The qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for zero and one and you can't

58
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.160
predict which it will be that the incidence you measure it,

59
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.860
it collapses into one of the definite states.

60
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.500
Superposition is a game changer.

61
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different

62
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.110
configurations at a time.

63
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560
That's 16 possible combinations out of which you can use just one four qubits in

64
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.340
superposition,
however,
can be an all of those 16 combinations at once.

65
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.030
This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.

66
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.170
20 of them can already store a million values in parallel.

67
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.910
A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement.

68
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.690
A close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other

69
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.050
state instantaneously,
no matter how far they are apart.

70
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.410
This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit,

71
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.490
you can directly deduce properties of it's partners without having to look.

72
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.760
Qubit manipulation is a mind bender as well.

73
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.770
A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite

74
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.970
output.
A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions,

75
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.800
rotates probabilities and produces another superposition as it's output.

76
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.980
So a quantum computer sets up some cubits,

77
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.290
applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities and finally

78
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.950
measures the outcome collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of Zeros

79
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:57.784
and ones.

80
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.870
What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible

81
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:04.180
with your setup all done at the same time.

82
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.740
Ultimately you can only measure one of the results and it will only probably be

83
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.710
the one you want.
So you may have to double check and try again.

84
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.940
But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement,

85
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.870
this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal

86
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:20.704
computer.

87
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.200
So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers in some

88
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.430
areas,
they are vastly superior.
One of them is database searching.

89
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.320
To find something in a database.

90
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.560
A normal computer may have to test every single one of it's entries.

91
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.130
Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time,

92
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.010
which for large databases is a huge difference.

93
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.660
The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining it security.

94
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.891
Right now,

95
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:51.910
your browsing email and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption

96
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:55.990
system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can

97
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:56.824
decode.

98
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.950
The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your

99
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.110
secret private key.
Luckily,

100
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.010
doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of

101
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.844
trial and error,

102
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.990
but a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.

103
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.410
Another really exciting new use is simulations.

104
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.180
Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources and even for

105
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.960
bigger structures such as molecules,
they often lack accuracy,

106
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.370
so why not simulate quantum physics?
With actual quantum physics?

107
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.600
Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might

108
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.120
revolutionize medicine.
Right now,

109
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:39.350
we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big

110
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:43.850
revolution for humanity.
We have no idea where the limits of technology are,

111
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.040
and there's only one way to find out.
