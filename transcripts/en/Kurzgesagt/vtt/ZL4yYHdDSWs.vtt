1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
Is there a border we will never cross?
Are there places we will never reach?

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.740
No matter how hard we try?

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.140
Turns out there are even with science fiction technology,

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.990
we are trapped in our pocket of the universe.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.920
How can that be and how far can we go?

6
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.110
We live in a quiet home of the Milky Way,

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.350
a spiral galaxy of average size about 100,000 light years across consisting of

8
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.610
billions of stars,
gas clouds,
dark matter,
black holes and neutron stars,

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.580
cabinets with a supermassive black hole in the galactic center.

10
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.630
From Afar,
our galaxy seems dance,

11
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.320
but in reality it consists mostly of empty space.

12
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.960
With our current technology,

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.010
sending a human to the closest star would take thousands of years,

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.250
so our galaxy is pretty big.

15
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.800
The Milky Way is not alone though along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than

16
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:14.090
50 Dorf galaxies.
It's part of the local group,
a region of space,

17
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.430
about 10 million light years in diameter.

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.750
It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the linear care supercluster,

19
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.060
which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the

20
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:27.320
observable universe.

21
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.730
Now let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future.

22
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.610
She mentee becomes a type three civilization,

23
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.900
does not get wiped out by aliens and develops the interstellar travel.

24
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.880
Based on our current understanding of physics and this best case scenario,

25
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.260
how far could we possibly go?
Well,
the local group,

26
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.550
it is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of.

27
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.860
Why it is certainly huge.

28
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.070
The local group accounts for only zero point 0000000000 1% of the observable

29
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:06.620
universe net,
there's number sink in for a moment.

30
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.850
We are limited to $100 billion for the percent of the observable universe.

31
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.500
The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us and that there is so much

32
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.130
universe that we will never be able to touch.
It's kind of frightening

33
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.090
white coat.
We go further.
Well,

34
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.270
it all has to do with the nature of nothing.

35
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.170
Nothing or empty space isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself so called

36
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.100
quantum fluctuations.
On the smallest scale,

37
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.200
there is constant action particles and antiparticles appearing and annihilating

38
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:46.034
themselves.

39
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.490
You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with dancer and less dense

40
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.300
regions.
Now,

41
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.460
let's go back 13.8 billion years when the fabric of space consisted of nothing

42
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:03.070
at all,
right after the big bang in an event known as cosmic inflation,

43
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.260
the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of

44
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.880
kilometers in fractions of a second.

45
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.780
This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all those

46
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.310
quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.670
and Subatomic distances became galactic distances with dense and less dense

48
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.070
regions.
After inflation,

49
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.170
gravity began to pull everything back together.
At the largest scale.

50
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.490
The expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome,
but at smaller scales,

51
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.300
gravity emerged victorious.
So overtime,

52
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.490
the denser regions or pockets of the universe grew into groups of galaxies like

53
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.720
the one we live in today.
Only stuff inside our pocket.

54
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.160
The local group is bound to us gravitation,
but wait,

55
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.660
what's the problem then?

56
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.310
Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one here?

57
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
Dark energy makes everything complicated.
About 6 billion years ago,

58
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.580
dark energy took over.

59
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.140
It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the

60
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.870
expansion of the universe.
We don't know why or what dark energy is,

61
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.960
but we can observe its effect.
Clearly in the early universe,

62
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.130
they were larger cold spots around the local group that grew into large clusters

63
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.510
with thousands of galaxies.
We are surrounded by a lot of stuff,

64
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.520
but none of those structures and galaxies outside of the local group are

65
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.330
gravitation be bound to us.
So the more the universe expands,

66
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.540
the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes over

67
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.220
time,
dark energy,

68
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:47.620
and we'll push the rest of the universal way from us causing all the other

69
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.370
classes,
galaxies,
and groups to eventually become unreachable.

70
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.030
The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away,

71
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.950
but all of them are moving away from us at speeds.
We can't ever hope to match.

72
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.390
We could leave the local group and fly through intergalactic space into the

73
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.360
darkness,
but we would never arrive anywhere.

74
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.390
While we will become more and more stranded,

75
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.800
the local group will become more tightly bound and merged together to form one

76
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.300
giant elliptical galaxy.

77
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.770
With the unoriginal name milk durometer in a few billion years,

78
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.210
but it becomes even more depressing.
At some point,

79
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.660
the galaxies outside the local group will be so far away that they will be too

80
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:32.680
faint to tact and the few photons that do make it to us,

81
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.520
we'll be shifted to such long wave lengths that there'll be undetectable.

82
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.320
Once this happens,

83
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.980
no information outside of the local group will be able to reach us.

84
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.530
The universe will recede from view.

85
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.010
It will appear to be a dark and empty in all directions forever of being born.

86
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:52.190
In the far future in milk.

87
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.050
Dramator will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe.

88
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.610
When they look far into empty space,

89
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.610
they will only see more emptiness and darkness.

90
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.200
They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation and they won't be able to

91
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:10.640
learn about the big bang.
They will have no way of knowing what we know today.

92
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.260
The nature of the expanding universe when it began and how it will add.

93
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.430
They will think the universe is static and a turtle milk durometer will be an

94
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.240
island in the darkness.

95
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.450
Slowly getting darker and darker still with it's trillion stars.

96
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.260
The local group is certainly large enough for humanity.
After all,

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.760
we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system and we have billions

98
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.080
of years to explore our galaxy.

99
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.180
We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time to see not

100
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:49.181
only our future but also our most distant past as isolated and remote as the

101
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.020
local group is.

102
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.470
We can perceive the entire universe grand and spectacular as it is right now.

103
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.090

104
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.120
Do you feel isolated in a humongous universe?

105
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.290
Why not set up a website or blog and share your thoughts with other humanoids

106
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.124
around you?

107
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.350
