00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.010
Do you think the European Union is worth it or should we end it?

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.260
Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU while others praise it's

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.094
achievements.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710
Everything considered is its existence good or bad.
For Europeans,

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.190
since it looks like the UK is leaving,

6
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.640
the EU will mostly treated as if it's no longer part of the club.

7
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.160
The European Union combining it's 27 member countries has a population of about

8
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:43.161
450 million people making it the third most populous sort of country in the

9
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.244
world.

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.560
It's the world's second largest economy by GDP and has the biggest single market

11
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.394
in the world,

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
but originally the creation of the European Union was all about one thing.

13
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.430
Pace.
Europeans are really good at war,

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.090
so they were embroiled in bloody conflicts for basically all their history.

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
A century long rivalry between Germany and France alone cost millions of lives

16
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.620
and ran so deeply.
The Germans invented their own word for it.
App Find Shafts.

17
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
After the Second World War,
Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.710
That was not based on a balance of military power.
Instead,

19
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.150
the economies politics and people's of Europe should become so closely

20
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:31.500
interconnected that war would become both impractical and unthinkable.

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
The plan works between EU members.
We've had over 70 years of peace.

22
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.500
Okay,
piece is great and all,

23
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.570
but what are the European Union's achievements and problems today?

24
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.660
EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms.

25
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
EU treaties and regulations ensure easy travel,
cheap telecommunications,

26
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900
a great variety of goods and services as well as very strong health and safety

27
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.734
standards.

28
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.640
European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such as

29
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.760
Microsoft,
apple or Facebook about fair competition,

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.650
tax evasion or data protection.
Through the EU science programs,

31
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.670
the European countries became a collaborative engine that serves as a hub of

32
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:19.170
science and the wider world unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere.

33
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.430
It makes it easy to apply for funds and set up international teams of experts

34
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:28.350
with the best equipment and turn the EU became the world leader in terms of its

35
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:33.120
global share of science researchers and produces more than 25% of the world's

36
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.300
research output with only 5% of its population,

37
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.530
but many citizens feel distrust towards the EU.

38
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
Brussels seems far away and untransparent technocratic and difficult to

39
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.994
understand.

40
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.530
It doesn't help that the EU is terrible at outreach and expanding what it

41
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.364
actually does.

42
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.770
This disconnect has also led to an ever shrinking voter turn out to over the

43
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.770
decades more transparency and accountability are desperately needed if the EU

44
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.580
institutions want the trust of their citizens.

45
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
Currently the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015 some countries

46
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.150
have accepted far greater numbers of asylum seekers than others.

47
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.810
While the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left alone,

48
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.150
other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration and

49
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:29.020
closed their borders effectively shutting down the largest root into Europe.

50
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.990
The [inaudible] wealth and freedom make it an attractive destination and this is

51
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.910
unlikely to change.
The population is split on how to react to that.

52
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.960
Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants with a different culture

53
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.120
without strictly demanding integration.

54
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.970
While others argue that immigration is not the problem,

55
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.180
but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration to

56
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.680
strike a balance between helping refugees,

57
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.030
turning illegal immigrants away and successfully integrating the ones that stay

58
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.900
remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the Union.

59
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.030
Immigration aside,
many more challenges lie in the future like defense.

60
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.523
Traditionally,

61
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.980
European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the u s through

62
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.190
NATO,
but in the current political climate,

63
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.150
Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United States for

64
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.880
its safety.
If combined today,

65
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.110
the militaries of EU members can form an effective defensive force and be the

66
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.980
third largest military in the world,
that could save a lot of money,

67
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.600
safeguard or European borders and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers

68
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:41.320
from 27 different countries serving one common purpose.

69
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.970
What about money?
Well,
it's complicated.

70
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.730
The EU created the largest single market in the world in site is you can trade

71
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:56.410
border and customs free countries that entered it got a massive boost to their

72
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.244
economists,

73
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.320
even between neighbors trade increased by up to 500% and there was a steady

74
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:03.640
creation of new jobs.

75
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.740
Research has suggested that joining the EU has left most new members with an

76
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.741
average of eight 12% higher GDP than if they had remained outside and for those

77
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:17.020
regions with a weaker economies and poor infrastructure,

78
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.640
EU institutions provide a billions of euros every year helping economic

79
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.550
investment infrastructure and social development.

80
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.070
On the negative side,

81
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.360
the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies and laws

82
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.240
regarding labor,
taxes and social security.

83
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.170
The cost of one hour of work in an EU country ranges from four euros an hour to

84
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:41.560
40 euros an hour.

85
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.630
Some countries have large industries and strong exports while others focus on

86
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:50.620
services,
tourism,
more natural resources.
On top of this,

87
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.850
the euro is the common currency of some,
but not all of these countries.

88
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.290
As the crisis shows,
this can be a recipe for disaster.

89
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.940
You cannot unify a vastly different economists under one currency,

90
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.430
but leave that economic policy is separate.

91
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.410
So should all EU countries unite under the common currency or not?

92
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.090
Should the weakest links be thrown out of the euro or should countries be made

93
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:21.230
to adopt a common policies on taxes,
healthcare and social security?

94
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.520
It's a question that's been brewing for years and there's nowhere near a

95
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.354
solution.

96
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.700
So everything briefly considered is the European Union worth it?

97
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.980
Here is our answer.

98
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.300
The EU is very flawed and still needs a lot of work,

99
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.110
but it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the

100
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.990
world.
Put together,
we lead in science.

101
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.710
What are the strongest economic powers could have one of the strongest

102
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:53.060
militaries in the world,
but more importantly,
the EU gives us peace,

103
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.180
security and a sense of shad identity and something we all crave in these

104
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.180
turbulent times.

105
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.420
Stability if we want to protect the values were so proud of a strong European

106
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.620
Union is the best way to make sure our voice is heard in the world alone as

107
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:14.210
small states will hardly stand a chance.
In a world of shifting superpowers,

108
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.720
what do you think about the EU when its future?
In recent years,

109
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.400
the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real world

110
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.330
consequences.
Let's not do that.
If you don't agree with this video,

111
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.840
you're not our enemy.
You just have a different opinion and that's fine.

112
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.120
We're all in the same boat after all.

113
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.240
So let's have a fact based discussion about our future.
