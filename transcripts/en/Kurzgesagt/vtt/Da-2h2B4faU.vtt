1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.820
What is the true nature of the universe?
To answer this question,

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.670
humans come up with stories to describe the world.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
We test our stories and then what to keep and what to throw away,

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.900
but the more we learn,
the more complicated and weird our stories become.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.550
Some of them,

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
so much so that it's really hard to know what they're actually about.

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.270
Like string theory,

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
a famous controversial and often misunderstood story about the nature of

9
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:32.424
everything.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.530
Why did we come up with this and is it correct or just an idea we should check

11
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:38.364
out?

12
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.750
<v 1>To understand the true nature of reality.</v>

14
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:52.120
We looked at things up close and we're amazed.

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.860
One dress landscapes in the dust,
zoos of bizarre creatures,

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.720
complex protein,
robots,

17
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.770
all of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless,

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.750
even smaller things.
Atoms.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.940
We thought they were the final layer of reality until we smashed them together

20
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.630
really hard and discovered things that can be divided anymore.

21
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.000
Elementary particles,
but now we had a problem.
They're so small.

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.060
Look,
we could no longer look at them.
Think about it.

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.390
What is seeing to see some things we need light,
an electromagnetic wave.

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.860
This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into

25
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.694
your eye.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.960
The way you've carries information from the objects that your brain uses to

27
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.820
create an image so you can't see something without somehow interacting with it.

28
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.170
Seeing is touching an active process,
not a passive one.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.050
This is not a problem with most things.
The particles are very,
very,

30
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.913
very small.

31
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.900
So small that the electromagnetic waves we use to see about too big to touch

32
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.720
them.
Visible light just passes over them.

33
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.180
We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much

34
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.720
smaller wavelengths.
But more wavelengths means more energy.

35
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.380
So when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy,

36
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.370
alters autism by looking at a particle,
we change it.

37
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.200
So we can't measure elementary particles precisely.
This fact,

38
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.360
it is important that it has a name,

39
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.340
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
the basis of all quantum physics.

40
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.510
So what does a particle look like then?
What is its nature?

41
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.190
We don't know.
If we look radiant,

42
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.360
we can see a blurry sphere of influence but not the particles themselves.

43
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.650
We just know they exist,
but if that's the case,

44
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.690
how can we do any science with them?

45
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
We did what the humans do and invented a new story,
a mathematical fiction.

46
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.030
The story of the point particle,

47
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.530
we decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space.

48
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.900
Any Electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass all

49
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.400
indistinguishable from each other.

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.350
This way physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions.

51
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.580
This is called quantum field theory and solved a lot of problems.

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.290
All of the Standard Model of particle physics is built on us and it predicts

53
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:28.030
lots of things very well.
Some quantum properties of the electron for example,

54
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:33.031
have been tested and are accurate up to 0.0 0000000000 2% so wild particles are

55
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.110
not really point by treating them as if they were.

56
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.270
We get a pretty good picture of the universe.

57
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.510
Not only did this idea or advanced science,

58
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.290
it also led to a lot of real world technology we use every day,

59
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.630
but as a huge problem.
Gravity in quantum mechanics,

60
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.630
all physical forces are carried by certain particles,

61
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.410
but according to Einstein's general relativity,

62
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.470
gravity is not a force like the others in the universe.

63
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.430
If the universe is a play,
articles are the actors,

64
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.210
but gravity is the stage to put it simply.

65
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.890
Gravity is a theory of geometry,
the geometry of space,

66
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:21.340
time itself of distances which we need to describe with absolute precision.

67
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.840
But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world,

68
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.650
our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics.

69
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.870
When physicists trying to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle

70
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.680
there,
mathematics broke down,
and this is a big problem.

71
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.730
If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model,

72
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.890
we would have the theory of everything.

73
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.340
So very smart people came up with a new story.

74
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.230
They asked what is more complex than a point,

75
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.050
a line or a string?
String theory was born.

76
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.700
What makes string theory so arrogant is that it describes many different

77
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.180
elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string.

78
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.530
Just like a violin string vibrating definitely can give you a lot of different

79
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:12.850
notes.
A string can give you different particles.
Most importantly,

80
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.440
this includes gravity.

81
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.900
String fairy promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe.

82
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.780
This caused enormous excitement and hype.

83
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.770
String fairy quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything.

84
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.570
Unfortunately,
string theory comes with a lot of strings attached.

85
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.660
Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our

86
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.660
universe with its three spacial and one temporal dimension.

87
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.170
String theory requires a 10 dimensions to workout.

88
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.770
So string theorists dip calculations in model universities and then try to get

89
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.230
rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe.

90
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.130
But so far nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been

91
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.360
proven in an experiment.

92
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.530
So string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe.

93
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.270
One could argue that in this case,
string theory ready isn't useful at all.

94
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.640
Science is all about experiments and predictions.
If we can't do those,

95
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.290
why should we bother with strings?
It really is all about how we use it.

96
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.010
Physics is based on Math two plus two makes four this is true no matter how you

97
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.460
feel about it.
And the maths in string theory does work out.

98
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.400
That's why string theory is still useful.

99
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.130
Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship,

100
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.770
but you only have blueprints at first small rowing boat.

101
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.420
There are plenty of differences.
The engine,
the materials,
the scale,

102
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.100
but both things are fundamentally the same things that float.

103
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.180
So by studying the rowing boat blueprints,

104
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.880
you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship.

105
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.400
Eventually with string theory,

106
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.940
we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been

107
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.300
puzzling physicists for decades,
such as how black holes work,

108
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.710
all the information paradox string Ferri main point us in the right direction

109
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.750
when used in their spirit.

110
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.040
String theory becomes eight pressures tool for theoretical physicists and help

111
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:17.120
them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics.

112
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.650
So maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything,

113
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.500
but just like the story of the point particle.

114
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.720
It may be an extremely useful story.

115
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.200
We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is,

116
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.490
but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out until one day.

117
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.500
Hopefully we do know
