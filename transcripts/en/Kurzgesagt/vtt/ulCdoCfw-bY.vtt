00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.150
Black holes are the largest collections of pure violent energy in the universe.

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
If you come too close,
they'll devalue and add your energy to that connection.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.010
And so the energy is lost to us forever.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.090
Or is as it turns out,
there's a universe cheat code,

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
a way of pairing civilizations until the very death of everything or of

6
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.250
constructing the largest bomb in the universe.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.320
But how didn't we learn that all energy is trapped forever in black holes,

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.510
even light?
This is true.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.650
Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in the universe is about

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.940
to get weirder.
For one simple reason.
Black Holes are spinning.

11
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.950
Why?
Black holes spin

12
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.530
when ready,
ready?

13
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:03.180
Massive stars die there cause collapse under their own gravity into black holes.

14
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.380
This means something very big becomes very,
very tiny,

15
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.590
like the tiniest to anything can be in this universe.

16
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.600
But stars are rotating and they fundamental property of our universe is that

17
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:18.360
things that are spinning don't want to stop spinning.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.880
We call this angular momentum and this angular momentum can't go away.

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.680
A big thing that spins and becomes smaller spins faster.

20
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.760
So as the core of a star collapses,
it's momentum,

21
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:37.761
makes it spin faster and faster and faster until it collapses into a black hole

22
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
and the bad cold keeps on spinning and conceivably fast.

23
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.450
Some of them spend millions of times a second.

24
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.200
Why spinning black holes are special,

25
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.410
just like non spinning black holes,

26
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.970
spinning black holes have an event horizon and a singularity at their core where

27
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.650
all of their mass is concentrated.

28
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.290
The singularity is usually described as a single infinitely small point with no

29
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.380
surface area,
but points can't rotate.

30
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.760
So a rotating singularity can't be a point.
Instead,

31
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
it's a ringing Darcy a ringing charity is a rank with a thickness of zero and no

32
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.320
surface spinning extremely fast containing all the mass of the black hole.

33
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.570
The black hole is spinning so fast that it morphs of space and time itself.

34
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.140
It literally drag space with us such as its power.

35
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.850
This creates a new and super weird region of space time.

36
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.120
The ergos fair,
which envelops the black hole.

37
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.770
If space and time are completely broken inside the event horizon,

38
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.980
then they're only half broken inside the Ergos Fair.

39
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.190
Inside the yogas fair,
nothing makes sense.

40
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280
It's possible to enter it and then leave it again,

41
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.200
but it's probably not a great experience.
You can imagine it like this.

42
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.650
Falling into a static black hole is like a sliding down a hole being inside the

43
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.140
Ergos Fair of a spinning black hole.
It's like spiraling down a deadly drain.

44
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.660
The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the form of rotation to

45
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.250
everything that enters the ergos fair.
The ring you'd guarantee,
makes you dance.

46
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.540
Whether you want to or not,

47
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.500
you need to move faster than the speed of light's just to stand still here,

48
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.210
which is a possible,
but here's our cheat code.
We can steal.

49
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.300
There's energy and there's a lot of energy to steel

50
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.810
houses.
Steal Energy from a monster.

51
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.970
Take the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

52
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.780
We could steal as much and as you from it as every single star in the milky way

53
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.870
or myths in a billion years combined.

54
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.390
The easiest way to steal this energy is of the enough to drop something into the

55
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.224
black hole.

56
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.730
We've seen that the ring in Iraqi forces energy on us when we enter the Ergos

57
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.270
fair,
which is a lot like being in a whirlpool with space time,

58
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:04.150
rushing around and around.
If you're clever,

59
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.440
you can use the water to your advantage and swim faster than before.

60
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
In practice,

61
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.380
this means sending a rocket into the other sphere and making a trade of the

62
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:15.214
black hole.

63
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.960
We give it some mass energy and it gives us some of its rotational energy,

64
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.500
but it's not a fair trade.
We get the better deal.

65
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.320
Normally if you fire a Rockies,

66
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.950
you exchange chemical energy for kinetic energy.

67
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.790
This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool,

68
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.180
but if you fire a rocket inside the is fair,

69
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.790
it's like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool.

70
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.140
The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much stronger boost.

71
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.420
Then you could get just by pushing yourself.

72
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.000
The boost from the rotation of the black hole is so big that you leave the Ergos

73
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.310
fair with much more energy than you agitate.

74
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.230
The black hole gives a tiny amount of its rotational energy to you and slows

75
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.790
down a little.
Obviously this requires a lot of food for thought.

76
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:08.791
Only black holes aren't picky eaters and advanced future civilization would

77
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.880
probably harvest asteroids to drop them into the black hole when they needed an

78
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:13.714
energy boost,

79
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.310
but there's an even better way to get energy for a black hole and oddly enough,

80
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.750
it builds the biggest bomb.

81
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.040
Any living thing could ever hope to build the black hole bomb.

82
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.180
We only need two things to build a black hole bomb of fast spinning black hole

83
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.440
and a big mirror.
The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole,

84
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.360
which is similar to a Dyson sphere,

85
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.510
a mega structure that harvest the energy of an entire star,

86
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.790
although our mirror would be easier to build and there is a simpler and black

87
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:48.610
holes are much,
much more compact than stars.

88
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.420
If we made the merit 10 centimeters thick,

89
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.650
the metal of a big asteroid would probably be enough material for a black hole

90
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.530
with the mass of our sun.
Once our mirror is in place,

91
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.270
we only need to open a window and shoot electromagnetic waves of the black hole.

92
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.340
You can imagine what happens next by imagining tossing a ball at a wall and it

93
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:14.930
coming back faster than a Bullock's.
The waves hit the black hole.
At lightspeed,

94
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.220
a small proportion of the waves falls past the event horizon to disappear

95
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.054
forever,

96
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.830
but a much larger amount sloshes through the Ergos Fair where the black hole

97
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.520
forces some of its rotational energy on them and amplifies them.

98
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.860
They now begin super radiant scattering,
which aren't fancy science words,

99
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.690
meaning bouncing around between Mira and black hole and getting stronger every

100
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.990
time they go around.
They are getting exponentially stronger.

101
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.780
By opening some windows in the mirror.

102
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.080
We can extract the energy from the waves as fast as they grow,

103
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.910
which we could use in theory to create what would be for all practical purposes,

104
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.600
an endless source of energy for trillions of years.

105
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.250
Or we could blow it up.
If the waves are not released,

106
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.570
they will continue to get stronger and stronger and take more and more energy

107
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:07.820
from the black hole until the mirror shatters.

108
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.160
A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova making the

109
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.820
bomb,
the largest explosion any living being could ever create

110
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.600
the last home and a dying universe.

111
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.850
The beauty of the black hole bomb the Penrose process and the super radiant

112
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.290
scattering is that they are not science fiction in the far,
far future.

113
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.070
This might be the only way to survive in our dime universe.

114
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.080
After all the red dwarfs of cooled down and all the white dwarves transformed

115
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:42.500
into black doors,
the universe will turn dark forever.

116
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.200
Rotating black holes might be the only sources of energy in the entire universe

117
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.960
that's knife could harvest.
If so,

118
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.350
the last living being and existence might one day end its life around a black

119
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:00.530
hole,
which is equally chilling and uplifting.

120
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.980
It turns out that even without any light,

121
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.470
there are places we can go

122
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.490
black holes or as interesting as they are most areas,

123
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.390
but there's actually a surprising amount.
We do know using maths,

124
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.260
we can calculate things and come up with theories about how we die if we fall

125
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.094
into them.

126
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.940
If you're the sort of person who gets excited about maths and calculating these

127
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:23.990
things for yourself,

128
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.980
our friends at brilliant have put together a fantastic black hole quiz to help

129
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:29.180
