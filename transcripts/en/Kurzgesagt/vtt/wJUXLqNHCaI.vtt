00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.500
Over 40 years ago,

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:05.520
US President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.410
starting an unprecedented global campaign.
We're the war on drugs today.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.970
The numbers are in the war on drugs is a huge failure with devastating,

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.320
unintended consequences.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.310
It led to mass incarceration in the u s to corruption,

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.110
political destabilization and violence in Latin America and Asia and Africa to

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:27.540
systemic human rights abuses across the world.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
It negatively affected the lives of millions of people.
All of this,

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
while we waste billions of dollars every year only to create and feel powerful

11
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.614
drug cartels,

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.150
while the goal of the war on drugs that seems less achievable than ever a world

13
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.400
without drugs,
how could this happen?

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.610
The coolest strategy of the war on drugs is no drugs,
no problems.

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510
So almost all of the efforts in the last few decades have been focused on

16
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.110
eradicating the supply of drugs and incarcerating drug traffickers.

17
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.030
But this ignores the most fundamental of market forces,
supply and demand.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.840
If you reduce the supply of anything without reducing the demand,

19
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.520
first it's price goes up.
This might lower sounds for many products,
lip,

20
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.330
not for drugs.
The drugs market is not price sensitive,

21
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.360
drugs will be consumed no matter what they cost.

22
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.010
So the effect is to encourage production of more drugs and recruitment of more

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260
traffickers which increases availability.

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.530
This is also known as the balloon effect.

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.980
Even if drug production or a major supply route is destroyed,

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.590
the supply for the end user is not reduced.

27
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.830
The perfect example of this is crystal meth.

28
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.510
The U s government tried to stop his production by strictly regulating the sound

29
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.430
of chemicals used to manufacture the drug.

30
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.340
This forced a big math producers out of business,

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.450
but the unintended consequences with thousands of small scale operations,

32
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:00.950
it started all over the country,

33
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.970
mostly in small towns and rural communities using chemicals that weren't

34
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.370
regulated.
In response to this,

35
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.960
some US states wanted to reduce the supply of homegrown math by regulating even

36
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.320
more chemicals,
which reduced the small scale mass production drastically.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.230
But the supply of math still stayed the same.

38
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.120
Mexican drug cartels immediately took over and opened big production operations.

39
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650
Their math was even better than it was before and they had loads of experience

40
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.670
in smuggling.
So all these efforts made math production more professional.

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.000
The drug more potent while supplying wasn't reduced at all.

42
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.550
You can't win this war on the supply side.
Not only are drugs widely available,

43
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.790
demand unbroken and some drugs pure than in the past with a budget of around $30

44
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.700
billion.

45
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.020
The US Drug Enforcement Agency has an efficiency rate of less than 1% when it

46
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:55.520
comes to stopping the flow of drugs into the u s and inside the u s for many

47
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:59.350
miners around the world,
it's as easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol,

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.440
but it doesn't stop here.

49
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.690
Prohibition may prevent a certain amount of people from taking drugs,

50
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.560
but in the process it causes huge damage to society as a whole.

51
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
Many of the problems we associated with drug use are actually caused by the war

52
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.900
against them.
For example,
prohibition makes drug stronger.

53
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.230
The more potent drugs you can store and as little space as possible,

54
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.950
the more profit you'll make.
It was the same during alcohol prohibition,

55
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.830
which led to an increased consumption of strong liquor over bear.

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.030
The prohibition of drugs also lead to more violence and murders around the
world.

57
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.290
Gangs and cartels have no access to the legal system to settle disputes,

58
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.910
so they use violence.
This led to an ever increasing spiral of brutality.

59
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.710
According to some estimates,

60
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.890
the homicide rate in the US is 25 to 75% higher because of the war on drugs and

61
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.930
in Mexico,
the country on the front line,

62
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.140
an estimated 164,000 have been murdered between 2007 and 2014 more people than

63
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.130
in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq in the same period combined.

64
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.910
But where the war on drugs might do the most damage to society is the

65
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.410
incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders.
For example,
the United States,

66
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.880
one of the driving forces of the war on drugs has 5% of the world's total

67
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:16.300
population,
but 25% of the world's prison population,

68
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.780
largely due to the harsh punishments and mandatory minimums.

69
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.540
Minorities suffer because of this,

70
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.890
especially African Americans make up 40% of all US president inmates,

71
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.100
and while white kids are more likely to abuse drugs,

72
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.840
blankets aren't 10 times more likely to get arrested for drug offences.
Okay,

73
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.120
but is there actually something different we could do?

74
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.920
Is there a way out of this mass?

75
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.720
In the 1980s Switzerland experienced a public health crisis related to heroin

76
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:48.340
use.
HIV rates skyrocket is and street crime became a problem.

77
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.000
The Swiss authorities tried a new strategy,
harm reduction.

78
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.890
They opened free heroin,

79
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.950
made an incentive where addicts will be treated and stabilized.

80
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.010
There people would be given free heroin of high quality.

81
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.300
They would get clean needles and have access to safe injection rooms,
showers,

82
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.340
beds,
and medical supervision.

83
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.240
Social workers help them find housing and deal with other problems in their

84
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:11.074
lives.

85
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.460
The results were a sharp drop in drug related crime and two thirds of the people

86
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.120
in the centers got regular jobs because now they could focus on getting better

87
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.150
instead of financing their addiction.
Today,

88
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.870
over 70% of all heroin addicts in Switzerland received treatment.

89
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.510
HIV infections have dropped drastically.

90
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.170
Deaths from heroin overdoses have dropped by 50% and drug related street sex

91
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:37.090
work and crime has been reduced enormously.

92
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.620
So there are methods that are not only way cheaper,
but also actually work.

93
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.540
Instead of creating more problems.

94
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.440
Drug prohibition led to a system that bulldoze his human rights,

95
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.480
costs vast sums of money,

96
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.520
and creates a lot of human misery build in pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

97
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.400
After 40 years of fighting,
it's time to find the end,

98
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.610
the war on drugs and to move on to something better.
