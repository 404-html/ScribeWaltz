00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.220
What if our universe comes with a self destruct button to eliminate itself so

2
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:09.150
cleanly and efficiently that every single physical thing would just stop

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.570
existing and life would be impossible forever.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.250
The ultima to ecological catastrophe vacuum decay.

5
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.770
Yeah.
To explain how our universe could destroy itself,

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.390
we need to understand two principles,
one energy levels.

7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.760
A core idea in physics is that everything has an energy level.

8
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
The higher the level,
the more energy is and the system would,
for example,

9
00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:46.060
has a high level,
it can be burned.

10
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.900
A process that releases the chemical energy stored in its molecular bonds and

11
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:50.800
turns it into heat.

12
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.940
The ash leftover is at a lower energy level than the wood before to stupidity.

13
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.890
Everything in our universe tries to move towards its ground state in which it's

14
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:08.300
completely stable and has as little energy as possible.
For example,

15
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.230
a ball on the hill is unstable and has a lot of potential energy.

16
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.640
When listervs it will roll down into the valley and lose its potential energy in

17
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.880
the process.
The ball is now in its ground state unstable.

18
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.500
It will remain like that.

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.670
Everything in our universe follows these two principles.

20
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.880
If something has a lot of energy,
it's unstable.

21
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.450
It was to get rid of it to become stable and reach its ground state.

22
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
This is true for every system,
even in the weird world of quantum mechanics.

23
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.980
If our current understanding of physics is correct than the universe gets its

24
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.510
properties from quantum fields,

25
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.500
we explained them in detail in another video for this video.

26
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.660
Imagine them as the rules of the universe.

27
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.570
They tell particles how to behave and interact

28
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.690
like everything in the universe.

29
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.000
They want to be in the lowest energy level possible,

30
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.500
which is called a vacuum state.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.250
This has nothing to do with vacuum in space.

32
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.940
It's just called this way because scientists are bad at naming things

33
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.330
within called the fields reach to their vacuum state except maybe one.

34
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.490
It's possible that the Higgs field is not stable,
but Matt has stable,

35
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.580
which is a fancy way of saying that it pretends to be stable,

36
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.180
but rarely is not great.
It would be a false vacuum.

37
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.280
The Hicksville is responsible for giving particles.
They're mass,
which rules,

38
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:33.530
how almost everything in the universe interacts.

39
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.680
What would happen if the Higgs field isn't a false vacuum?

40
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.730
Think of our ball in the valley.
The ball is the Higgs field.

41
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.260
The value might not be the lowest energy state for the Higgs field.

42
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.170
There might be an even deeper value that it wants to get to.

43
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.130
This would mean that the Higgs field has a lot of potential energy waiting to be

44
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:52.964
released.

45
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.010
The Higgs field could be like a piece of wood but drenched in gasoline waiting

46
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.500
to set the universe fire.

47
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.760
The random spark like quantum tunneling could release the potential energy of

48
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.840
the Higgs field.
This could happen at any time and without warning.

49
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.920
If at any point in space,
this so called a vacuum decay starts.

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.600
There is no turning back.

51
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.050
As the Higgs field crashes into the lower energy states,

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.540
it releases a massive amount of potential energy.

53
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.160
This energy pushes the space around it over the barrier which releases more

54
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.110
potential energy as fear of the new stable Hicksville door.

55
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.330
True vacuum grows at the speed of light in all directions.

56
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.270
Imagine it like setting a sea of gasoline,
the size of the universe on fire.

57
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.650
This fear is surrounded by Shell of energy that devours everything that comes

58
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:46.390
into contact with whatever it touches is eliminated from existence.

59
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.980
The bubble will continue to grow forever deleting the universe on its way.

60
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.970
There is no way to be warned since it's so fast,

61
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.850
but there's nothing we could do anyway.
Now,

62
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.230
destruction would be instant in a fraction of a second earth would be gone,

63
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.480
but it actually gets worse

64
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.680
as the energy level of the Hicksville changes.

65
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.640
It changes all the physics and the true vacuum of the sphere.

66
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.560
The standard model will be overthrown,

67
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
superseded by different physics that we don't know how fundamental particles

68
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:23.470
behave,
how atoms hold together,
how chemicals react.

69
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.140
Vacuum decay weren't just destroy life.
It will destroy chemistry itself.

70
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.450
Making life as we know is impossible.

71
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.110
We simply have no idea what it will be like in site.

72
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.140
It might be a shadow of what it is now or not.

73
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.950
We don't know if vacuum decay happens.

74
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.730
The outlook is indeed grim if you feel slightly wide.

75
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.100
Now dubby at this point,
false fact,

76
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.280
Kim is speculation based on our current understanding of particle physics,

77
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.960
which might be wrong.
It's kind of like using a ruler to measure a continent

78
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.050
so you can do it,
but you might be off by quite a bit at the end.

79
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.150
Right now,

80
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.530
no one can say a vacuum decay is a thing that's real or just a scary idea.

81
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.150
But even if one or multiple spheres of death have already started expanding,

82
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.260
the university is so big that they might not reach us for billions of years.

83
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.850
If they're far enough away,

84
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.510
they might not ever be able to reach us because of the expansion of the
universe.

85
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.380
The speed of light is not that fast on the scale of the universe.

86
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.550
So while vacuum to Kate is fascinatingly scary right now,

87
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:35.350
there are other things we should be more afraid of.
In contrast to vacuum decay,

88
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.660
we have the power to prepare for most of them.

89
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.400
Videos like this one take hundreds of hours to make.
So supporters on page.
Sean,

90
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.800
if you like to learn more about the destruction of everything,

91
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.270
it really helps us out.

92
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.050
We tried to destroy the universe at least once every few months.

93
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.470
So let us know in the comments if you have doomsday scenarios you would like us

94
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:56.890
to cover.
