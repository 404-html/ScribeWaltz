00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
Gmos are one of the most controversial areas of science.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.740
Genetic engineering is used in many fields,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.800
but even the medical applications like GM NCD now widely accepted the debate

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
heats up when it comes to food and agriculture.
Why is that?

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.770
Why is the same thing treated so differently?

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.120
the fears and the future of Gmos.

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.170
Humans have been genetically modifying plants and animals for thousands of
years.

9
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.260
Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields.

10
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.750
Maybe one of your wolves who was especially loyal.

11
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.120
So you did the smart thing and bread,

12
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.520
the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you.

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.400
Traits adjust an expression of genes.

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.930
So with each generation those genes got more pronounced.

15
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.990
After thousands of years,

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.430
almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre

17
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:15.480
domesticated state.
If humans have been changing genes for millennia,

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.800
what makes a circle to genetically modified organisms or Gmos?
Different?

19
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.030
Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky heads,

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
genetic engineering and lemonades.
This factor,
we can choose the traits we want,

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.880
make fruit grow bigger immune to pests and so on.

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.340
So why are people concerned about them?

23
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.090
<v 1>Okay.
Netstock</v>

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.410
<v 0>with one of the most common objections to GMOs,</v>

25
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.510
gene flow meaning GM crops could make us with traditional crops and introduce

26
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.610
the unwanted new characteristics into them.

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.890
There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention but it is a big anti

28
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:59.310
GMO argument by itself terminates the seeds.

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.560
The idea is that they could produce style plans requiring farmers to buy new

30
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:05.610
seeds every year.

31
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.720
The very concept of this however caused a public outcry,

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.880
stopping the technology being put to use.

33
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.410
This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA that have

34
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.950
been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted and traces of modified

35
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.510
genes found in foreign crops.

36
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.300
The GM plants can't run wild in tiny many crops pollinate them.

37
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.760
Sales and all crops have to be related to mingle.

38
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.140
There are also cultural methods like buffer zones to keep unintentional crossing

39
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.003
at a minimum,

40
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
but if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally crossed with

41
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:43.350
a non Gmo.

42
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.360
There's actually a more important question is food that comes from GM crops

43
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.730
different to food from non GM crops.

44
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.810
This question has been a major concern from the very beginning.

45
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.310
GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible and the results

46
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.230
are evaluated by multiple agencies after more than 30 years and thousands of

47
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:05.770
studies.

48
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.570
The science is in eating GMO plants is no more rescue than their non GMO

49
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:14.530
equivalent,
but don't just take our boy Fred sources for their sand.

50
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.270
Other claims are in the video description,

51
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.610
but what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic?
For example,

52
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
bt tropes,
a gene borrowed from the bacterium,
Bacillus Thuringiensis,

53
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.490
let's engineer plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of

54
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.491
specific in Sag past the plant makes its own pesticide insects that he tends to

55
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.310
die.
That sounds alarming.

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.620
Pesticide sprays can be washed off while the poison in bt crops is inside the

57
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.560
plant,
but actually it's not a big deal.

58
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.280
Poison is really just a question of different perspectives.

59
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.900
What's harmless to one species might kill another coffee,
for example,

60
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.280
is a poison that kills in but is harmless to us or take chocolate.

61
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.400
It's dangerous for dogs,
but a pleasure for humans.

62
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.110
Bt crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the

63
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.950
digestive tract of certain insects.
It's completely harmless for us.

64
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.680
There's also the opposite approach.

65
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.100
Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers.

66
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.690
This way farmers can use them widely hitting the other plants competing for

67
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.400
resources without harming the crop.

68
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.010
Here we get to the dark underbelly of Gmos for the pesticide industry.

69
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.240
They are big business.

70
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.550
Over 90% of all cash crops in the u s are herbicide resistant mostly to

71
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.590
glyphosate.
As a result,

72
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.770
the use of glyphosate has increased gravy that isn't only bad force as much less

73
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:48.010
harmful to humans than many other herbicides.
Still,

74
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.730
this means farmers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only

75
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.640
costing more Bannon's to ways of managing weeds or site.

76
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.330
That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate.

77
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.710
Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern

78
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.640
agriculture and the business practice of the huge corporations that control our

79
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:11.410
food supply.
This criticism is not only van is it's also important.

80
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.130
We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model.

81
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.530
Gmos as a technology are actually an ally and not an enemy in that fight.

82
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.120
Helping to save and protect leisure and minimize our impact on the environment.

83
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.320
Let's look at some positive examples.

84
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.170
That gland is an important crop in Bangladesh,

85
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.810
but often whole harvests are destroyed by pasts.

86
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.060
Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides.
Not only was this very expensive,

87
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.340
farmers also frequently got sick.

88
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.810
The introduction of a new GM at gland in 2013 stop this,

89
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.810
the same bt protein we talked about before,

90
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.920
an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans was engineered into them.

91
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.720
This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80% the health of farmers

92
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.721
improves and their income rose dramatically and sometimes a GM approach is the

93
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.894
only option.

94
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.240
In the 1990s the Papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ring spot

95
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:18.450
virus which threatened to wipeout Hawaiian Papaya.
The solution.

96
00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:23.120
It was a Papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus without

97
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.430
it.
The states,
but by industry would have collapsed

98
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.460
all the stories,
so a very narrow application.

99
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.760
99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides or are resistant against

100
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.400
them.
There is so much more we could do.

101
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.500
The scientists are working on Gmos that could improve our diet plants that

102
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:52.240
produce more or different nutrients like fruit with higher antioxidant levels

103
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:56.890
that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins on a larger scale.

104
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.060
We're trying to engineer plants that are more resilient to climate change plans

105
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.450
that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions,

106
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.940
making them resistant to droughts or floods.

107
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.010
Gmos could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment,

108
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.870
but actively helped to protect it.

109
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.070
The scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air like

110
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:22.150
microbes.
Nitrogen is a common fertilizer,
but it's built up,

111
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:24.730
pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change.

112
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.530
Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once.

113
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.270
The over use of fertilizers in the developed world as well as the shortage of is

114
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.620
in developing countries.

115
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.150
We could even modify plans to become super effective carbon collectors like the

116
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:45.151
American chestnut tree to mitigate and actually reverse climate change with the

117
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:48.430
tools we have today.
Our imagination is the limit.

118
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.340
The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day.
Hey,

119
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.430
you an estimate suggests will need 70% more by 2050 we could grow that food by

120
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:07.560
caring more and more for us to create fields and pastures and by using more

121
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:12.060
pesticides all we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now with more

122
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:17.061
effective methods like GM crops intensifying fobbing instead of expanding it

123
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.930
means Gmos could become the new organic.
In a nutshell,

124
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.920
Gmos have the potential to not only drastically changed agriculture,

125
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.370
but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior.

126
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.360
Gmos could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere.

127
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.160
This video took more than 600 hours to make,

128
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.810
which would be impossible without viewer support on patrion.com if you'd like to

it's ready,
very helpful,

It's a reward.

131
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.840
If you want to learn more about genetic modification,

we have more videos explaining the yeah,
