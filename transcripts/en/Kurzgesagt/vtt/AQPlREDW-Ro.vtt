00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.780
Oh do ya.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.570
Just when you thought the problem was solved because you haven't heard about it

3
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.690
for a while.
Everything's back to murderous cows and terror.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.230
What happened in 2003 the US invaded Iraq because of its alleged connections to

5
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.720
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction at the time Sadam Hussein,

6
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.740
a brutal dictator world,

7
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.270
the country he was part of the Sunni minority and suppress the sheer majority.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.470
Iraq was conquered fairly quickly,
but the U S had no plan for the country.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.930
The until then suppressed Shia majority took over and began a pressing the sun

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.650
is because suppressing other phases proven to be such a good idea.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.330
Unsurprisingly,

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
a Sunni rebel uprising began and terrorist groups like al Qaeda trickled into

13
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.030
Iraq and local forces.

14
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:45.990
Often former sunny military began fighting the US troops and the newly formed

15
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.520
Iraqi state peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006 since then,

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.430
people in Iraq have basically been segregated by religion.

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.950
So in a tragic irony of history,

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.030
the US invasion lets the formation of the very terrorists that u s wanted to

19
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.930
eliminate in the first place because Iraq was now the perfect training ground

20
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.830
for terrorism.
To understand this complicated conflict better,

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.190
we need to understand the relationship between the two main branches of the

22
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:13.860
Muslim faith,
Shia and Sunni Islam,

23
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.360
Sunni as make up about 80% of the Muslim world and Shia about 20% and the

24
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:22.410
hardliners on both sides don't like each other very much.

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.000
Saudi Arabia and Iran,
other two most powerful players in the game of faiths,

26
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.200
they both have no separation of state and religion,
domestic problems,

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.490
and a lot of oil money and they support groups that fight the other religious

28
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:39.480
orientation.
And what are those terror organizations supported by?

29
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:43.830
Saudi Arabia was the Islamic state in Iraq or Isi for short.

30
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.720
In 2010 the Arab spring happened and changed the whole situation in the Middle

31
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.450
East in Syria,
dictator Bashar Al Assad.

32
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.930
It didn't think much of resigning and started a gruesome civil war against his

33
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.800
own people.
The longer the war went on,
the more foreign groups joined the fight,

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.340
most of them for religious reasons and with the goal of building an Islamic

35
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.910
state and the region,
and one of them was the infamous Isi,

36
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.750
which now became the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria or isis.

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.580
They had fought in Iraq for years and had thousands of well trained and phonetic

38
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.440
soldiers.
They already choirs.

39
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:21.240
I controlled parts of northern Iraq and were very determined to build their

40
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.770
religious state and they changed the game in Syria like no one expected.

41
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.600
Isis was so unbelievably violent and radical that sooner was at war with almost

42
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.910
every other faction of the Syrian rebel armies.

43
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.690
They attacked and killed members of other Muslim terrorist groups in the

44
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.740
territories they controlled.

45
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.880
They built an Islamic state with rules are so strict that even the hardliners of

46
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.690
al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia was shocked and withdrew their support.

47
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.160
Isis has been accused of responsibility for multiple massacres against
civilians,

48
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.820
countless suicide bombings,
the hostage taking of women and children,

49
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.250
the execution of their prisoners and beheadings,
all kinds of medieval horrors.

50
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.740
We would rather not have to.

51
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.710
At a straight and this lovely gathering of human beings.
We,

52
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.540
he decided it was time to take more territory in Iraq.
Since the U s left Iraq,

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.170
the sheer prime minister and very al Maliki has monopolized power and

54
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.240
discriminated against sooners wherever possible.

55
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.560
The government of Iraq is widely regarded as being corrupt and capable,

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.440
and it's certainly hated by a large part of its citizens.

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.050
The Iraqi army consisting of about 300,000 soldiers was created using 25 billion

58
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.280
US dollars in tax money,

59
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.760
but it's not all to its government and has been withdrawing or completely

60
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:35.620
disbanded giving up city after city because Isis has announced that everyone who

61
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.890
opposes them will be killed.
They have proven they mean business.

62
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.400
By June,
2014 they'd conquered a big chunk of Iraq,
including Mosul,
Iraq,

63
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.510
second largest city.

64
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.590
They'd stolen hundreds of millions from captured banks making them the richest

65
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.970
terror organization on earth,

66
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.260
and they are constantly working on establishing a super medieval religious
state,

67
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.580
Iran and the u s or even considering working together as a fight them.

68
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.690
That's how gruesome the situation is,
events and a rock show.
Again,

69
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.020
that explosion that people you've defeated in a walk denying them power or

70
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:11.950
living in a stake in the rebuilding of the country is just sowing the seeds of

71
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:16.270
the next bout of violence.
Somehow we have to break this circle.
