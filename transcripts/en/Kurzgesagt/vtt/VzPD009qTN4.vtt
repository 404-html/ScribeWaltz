1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.530
Microbes are everywhere on your phone,

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.480
in your water bottle,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
on your hands before you wash them on your hands after you wash them and

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.611
literally everywhere else on top of you to microbes are omnipresent at any

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.590
moment and there is nothing we can do about it.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.830
So millions of years ago we made a pact.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
We give them shelter and food and in turn they work for us.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.640
But the more we learn about this partnership,
the more it looks like a cold wall

9
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.450
inside our mother's womb.

10
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.640
Humans start out stero when we're born and traveling through the birth canal,

11
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.630
billions of our mother's bacteria cover every single part of our bodies.

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.480
This is an essential part of human health.

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
Children born via c section have a higher rate of asthma,
immune diseases,

14
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.360
and even leukemia.

15
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.920
So our bodies do not only accept the invasion of microorganisms,

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.330
they welcome it.
Over millions of years,

17
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
we could evolved to make the best of our relationship.
Mother's milk,

18
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.551
for example,

19
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:21.330
contains a special sugars that are meant to feed and support certain groups of

20
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.920
microbes,
work as a decoy for others and help to modulate the immune system.

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.570
It takes up to two years until a healthy microbe community has fault.

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.880
Every human has their own unique microbiome made up of bacteria,
viruses,

23
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.770
fungi and other organisms.

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.480
We have three categories of guests on and in our bodies.

25
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.140
One quiet passengers that do their own thing and our politely ignored by being

26
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.360
there.
They take up space and keep more aggressive.

27
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
Intruders in check two guests that harmless but with whom we've learned to live.

28
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.260
For example,
bacteria that literally create acid that melts our teeth.

29
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.310
If we don't brush enough,

30
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.570
they want to take up as much space as they can and we don't want them to,

31
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.790
but we can't get rid of them entirely.

32
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.470
Three friendly fellows that our bodies want to have around.

33
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.130
Most of them are a community of 380,000 billion bacteria from up to 5,000

34
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.380
different species that live in our gut.

35
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
These gut micro organisms help us digest food and pull additional calories from

36
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.290
things we can't digest ourselves.
Unfortunately,

37
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.290
our gut is also the perfect point of attack for intruders,

38
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.300
so it's guided by an aggressive army,

39
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.600
our immune system to survive hair.

40
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.530
Our micro biome coevolve with us to be able to communicate with our body.

41
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.240
The most important part of that is to ask the immune system to not kill them,

42
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.050
but they also have a real motivation to keep our gut healthy.

43
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.060
So some of them produce messenger substances that help to educate the immune

44
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:01.180
system and others stimulate the gut cells to regenerate faster.

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.520
But over the last few years,

46
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.630
evidence has emerged that the influence of our gut micro biome goes much,

47
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.830
much further.
It might even talk directly to our brain.

48
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.980
We've observed a few curious things.

49
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.230
90% of our body's Serotonin and important messenger substance for nerve cells is

50
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.370
produced in the gut.

51
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.410
Some scientists think the microbiome does this to communicate with the Vegas

52
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.270
nerve,
the information highway of our nervous system.
Other examples are bacteria.

53
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.070
That's to me innate immune cells in the gut.

54
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.820
So they send the kind of alarm signal to the brain here.

55
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:39.880
It activates immune cells that help the brain recover from injuries.

56
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.790
Since the brain decides where we eat,

57
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.240
the micro biome is interested in a healthy brain.

58
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.040
A new field of science is opening up here and we're just on the verge of

59
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.640
understanding how these complex systems inside our bodies interact.

60
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.860
But we are starting to see how much our microbiome actually influences us and

61
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.860
our behavior.
Take depression,
for example,

62
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.600
healthy rats fed microbes from the guts of depressed people began showing

63
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.290
anxiety like behavior and symptoms that look like depression.

64
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.050
And in early 2017 a study link the micro biome to intelligence by connecting a

65
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:21.610
certain setup of bacteria in newborns with better motor and language skills,

66
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.340
but it might also influence our daily lives tests with fruit flies so that their

67
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.250
microbiome influenced what kinds of food they craved.

68
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.590
This could mean your microbes are able to tell your brain which food it should

69
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:38.380
get them.
Although this is not a one way street,

70
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.950
the seed for our microbiome comes from our mother,

71
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.430
but how it develops and changes is determined by what we eat.

72
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.060
The organisms in our gut feed on different things.

73
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.550
Some like fibers and leafy greens,

74
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.230
others go for sugars and starches and some love greasy fries and butter.

75
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.960
Our gas is like a garden in which we constantly decide what will grow and

76
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:04.510
blossom.
If we eat healthily,

77
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.190
we breed bacteria that like healthy food.
If we eat a lot of fast food,

78
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.400
then we breed fast food.
Loving bacteria.

79
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.810
Life is hard so we can get trapped in a vicious circle.

80
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.490
You have a stressful time and eat lots of burgers and fries and pizza.

81
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.580
This is awesome for fast food bacteria.

82
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.760
They multiply and multiply and take up space from vegetable loving bacteria but

83
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:34.030
even worse they send signals to the brain to continue what it's doing.

84
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.130
This makes you want more fast food which breeds more fast food bacteria which

85
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.470
makes you crave fast food and so on.

86
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.840
This kind of self reinforcing cycle could play a huge role in obesity,

87
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.460
but it's important to stress that you can find this process and reverse it by

88
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:54.580
eating healthily and breeding mauled good bacteria.

89
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.500
Beyond weight gain.

90
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.470
Our biome has also been linked to other serious diseases like autism,

91
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.450
schizophrenia and cancer.

92
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.740
One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's is actually gut problems.

93
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.460
If your body is overrun with bacteria that harm you,

94
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.780
there is often only one solution.
You bring in an army of good guys.

95
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.460
That's very easy.
You just transplant some healthy poop.

96
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.830
You do that by literally transferring poop from a healthy person into your gut.

97
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.730
This method is already used to cure diarrhea.

98
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.510
That's caused when c difficile bacteria takeover a gut microbiome,

99
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.680
but we just don't know enough about the complex interplay at work here yet.

100
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.360
For example,
the transplant from an overweight donor cured a woman's diarrhea,

101
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.400
but contributed to her obesity down the line.
This cause some ways,

102
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.620
and another study tried to reverse the effects.

103
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.860
Poop transplants from slim people to obese ones,

104
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.600
gave them a more diverse microbiome and made them less sensitive to incident

105
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.540
both things.
That also happened when people lose weight.

106
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.910
We need to do a lot more science to really understand how our microbes make us

107
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:07.880
healthy or sick,
but whether we like it or not,

108
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.210
we need our micro biome and it needs us.

109
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.300
We'll never have our bodies to ourselves,

110
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.680
but we have gained a powerful ally if we can just keep the peace.
