00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.460
One day the universe will die,
but why and how?

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.320
And will the universe be dead forever and how do we know that?

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.880
First of all,
the universe is expanding and not only that,

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.620
the rate of its expansion is accelerating.
The reason dark energy,

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.780
dark energy is a strange phenomenon that scientists believe permeates the

6
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.614
universe.

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
Until 1998 we thought that the universe must work a bit like a book that you

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.850
throw into the sky.
The ball moves up,

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.980
but at some point it has to come down again.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.320
But to the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up.
That's length.

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.820
Throwing a ball up and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.470
Where is this acceleration coming from?
Well,
we don't know,

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.630
but we call it dark energy.

14
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.890
Einstein thought of it first and then decided it was stupid.

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.320
Now astrophysicists have decided it is plausible.
Trouble is,

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
this is all very theoretical and we don't actually know what the properties of

17
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:06.600
dark energy are,

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
but there are various theories and they lead us to three scenarios for the end

19
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.600
of the universe.

20
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.350
<v 1>One,
the big rip.</v>

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.950
<v 0>Since its birth,
the universe has been expanding for unknown reasons.</v>

22
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.380
New Space is created everywhere.
Equally,

23
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.490
the space between got access expands so they move apart.

24
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.520
The space inside galaxies also expands,

25
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.520
but here gravity is strong enough to keep them together.

26
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.890
In the big rip scenario,

27
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.750
the expansion accelerates up to a point West base expansive so fast that gravity

28
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.700
can't compensate for this effect anymore.

29
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.510
The result is a banker rep at first only large structures like galaxies are torn

30
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:58.630
apart.
Since space between the single objects expands very fast.

31
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.030
Magged big bodies like black holes of stars and planets die there.

32
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:06.040
Gravity isn't strong enough to keep them together,

33
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.970
so they dissolve into that components in the end space,

34
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:12.190
but expand faster than the speed of light.

35
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.970
Atoms would now be effected and they would just disband.

36
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.940
One space is expanding faster than light.

37
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.840
No particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore.

38
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.300
The universe would dissolve into countless lowly particles that won't be able to

39
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:31.840
touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universal.

40
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.770
Hmm.
And you thought you felt lonely

41
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.920
to heat death or a big freeze.
In a nutshell,

42
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.190
the difference between the big rip and heat death is that in a heat death

43
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:50.110
scenario matter stays in tax and is converted over an incredibly long but finite

44
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:53.860
period of time into radiation while the universe expands forever.

45
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.700
But how does this work?
Let's talk about entropy.

46
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.150
Every system towards the state of highest entropy,

47
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.460
like when we have a Latte Macchiato,
initially it has different regions,

48
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.420
but over time they will cool down and disintegrate until it's uniform.

49
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.390
And this also applies to the universe.

50
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960
So while the universe gets bigger and bigger matters slowly did and spreads out

51
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.230
at some point after lots of generations of stars,

52
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.530
all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted so the universe

53
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.410
will turn dark,
the remaining sons will die,

54
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.000
black holes,

55
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.800
we'll slowly to generate and evaporate over trillions of years due to what's

56
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.660
known as hawking radiation.
When this process is complete,

57
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.050
only a doughnut gas of photons and link particles remains until even this to

58
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:54.400
case all activity that universal ceases.
At this point,

59
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.260
entropy is at its maximum and the universe is dead forever.

60
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.510
Unless theoretically it might be possible that arts are an incredibly long

61
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.344
amount of time.

62
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.330
There might be a spontaneous entropy decreased as a result of something called

63
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.360
quantum tunneling leading to a new big bang

64
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.680
three big crunch and big bounce.

65
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.770
This is the most uplifting scenario.

66
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.610
If there is less dark and as you than we think or it decreases over time,

67
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.880
gravity will be the dominating force in the universe.
One day.

68
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.530
In a few trillion years,

69
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.640
the rate of expansion of the universe will slow down and stop.
After that,

70
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.690
it reverses.
Galaxies will race it each other merging.

71
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.760
As the universe becomes smaller and smaller.

72
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.720
Since a smaller universe also means our hotter universal temperatures rise

73
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.980
everywhere,
all at once.

74
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.900
100,000 years before the big crunch background radiation would be hotter than

75
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:51.550
the surfaces of most stars,

76
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.640
which means that they would be cooked from the outside minutes before the big

77
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:58.840
trunch happens.
Adam cause a ripped apart before supermassive.

78
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.540
Black holes devour everything.
Finally,

79
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.070
all black holes would merge into a super massive mega black hole that contains

80
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:10.570
the entire massive,
the university.
And in the last moment before the big crunch,

81
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.900
it would devour the universe,
including itself.

82
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.610
The big bounce theory states that this has happened a lot of times under the

83
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:23.380
universe,
goes through an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction.
Well,

84
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.000
wouldn't that be nice?
So what will actually happen to the universe in the end?

85
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.240
At the moment,
heat death seems the most likely,

86
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.680
but we cuts because I would hope that this dead forever stuff is wrong and the

87
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:40.660
universe will start over and over again.
We don't know for sure either way.

88
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.170
So let's just assume the most uplifting theory is true,

89
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.500
by the way.
We have a Twitter account.

90
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>
