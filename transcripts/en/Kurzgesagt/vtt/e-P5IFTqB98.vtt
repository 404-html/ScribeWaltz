00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.440
Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.770
They don't seem to make any sense at all.
Where do they come from?

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.020
And what happens if you fall into one?

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.370
Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms that collapsed

5
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.910
from enormous gas cloud to under their own gravity.
In that core,

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.290
nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium really seen a tremendous

7
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.124
amount of energy.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.140
This energy in the form of radiation pushes against gravity maintaining a

9
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.270
delicate balance between the two forces.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.770
As long as there is fusion in the corps and he star remains stable enough,

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.890
but for stars with way more mass than our own sun,

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.050
the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements until they

13
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:49.884
retired.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.570
Unlike all the elements that went before the fusion process that creates iron

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.040
doesn't generate any energy.

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
Iron builds up at the center of the Star until it reaches a critical amount and

17
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:04.130
the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken.

18
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
The core collapses within a fraction of a second.

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
The star implodes moving at about a quarter of the speed of light feeding even

20
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.860
more mass into the core.

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.090
It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are

22
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.600
created.
As the star dies in a supernova explosion,

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
this produces either a neutron star or if the star is massive enough,

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.820
the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole.

25
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.620
If you looked at a black hole,
what you'd already be seeing is the event horizon.

26
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.700
Anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be traveling faster than the

27
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:42.180
speed of light to escape.
In other words,
it's impossible,

28
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.050
so we just see a black sphere reflecting nothing,

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.170
but if the event horizon is the black part,

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.430
what is the whole part of the black hole?
The singularity,

31
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.530
we're not sure what it is exactly.
A singularity,
maybe infinitely dense,

32
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.580
meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space with no

33
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.730
surface,
all volume or something completely different.

34
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.320
Right now we just don't know.
It's like a dividing by zero error.

35
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.280
By the way,
black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner.

36
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.670
If we were to swap the sun for an equity massive black hole,

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.360
nothing much would change for us except that we would freeze to death.
Of course,

38
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.450
what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole?

39
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.100
The experience of time is different around black holes from the outside.

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.710
You seem to slow down as you approached the event horizon,

41
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.660
so time passes slower for you.
At some point you would appear to freeze in time,

42
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.700
slowly turn red and disappear.

43
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
While from your perspective you can watch the rest of the university and fast

44
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.790
forward kind of like seeing into the future.

45
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.020
Right now we don't know what happens next but we think it could be one of two

46
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:53.140
things.
One,
you die a quick death of black coal,

47
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:56.130
curved space so much that once you cross the event horizon,

48
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.020
there is only one possible direction.

49
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.270
You can take this literally inside the event horizon.

50
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.660
You can only go in one direction.

51
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.110
It's like being in a really tight Annie that closes behind you.
After each step,

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.070
the massive black hole is so concentrated.
At some point,

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.030
even tiny distances of a few centimeters would mean that gravity acts with

54
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.970
millions of times more force on different parts of your body.

55
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.530
Your cells get torn apart as your body stretches more and more until you're a

56
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:28.531
hot stream of plasma one atom wide to you die a very quick death.

57
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.090
Very soon after you cross the event horizon,

58
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.850
you would hit a fly wheel and be terminated in an instant.

59
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.180
Neither of these options are good.
Tickety pleasant.

60
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.690
How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole.

61
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.770
A smaller black hole would kill you before you even entered.
It's a vent horizon.

62
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
While you probably could travel inside a supermassive black hole for quite a

63
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.030
while.
As a rule of thumb,
the further away from the singularity you are,

64
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.630
the longer you live,
black holes come in different sizes.

65
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.070
There are stellar mass black holes with a few times the mass of the sun and the

66
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.420
diamonds of an asteroid,

67
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.350
and then there are these super massive black holes which are found at the heart

68
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.800
of every galaxy and have been feeding for billions of years.

69
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.230
Currently the largest supermassive black hole known as s five zero zero one four

70
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.620
plus eight one 40 billion times the mass of our sun.

71
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.120
It is 236.7 billion kilometers in diameter,

72
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.510
which is 47 times the distance from the sun to Pluto.

73
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.490
As powerful as black holes are,

74
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.450
they will eventually evaporate through a process called hawking radiation.

75
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.050
To understand how this works,
we have to look at empty space.

76
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.270
Empty space is not really empty,

77
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.050
but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and annihilating each

78
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:44.230
other.
Again,
when this happens right on the edge of a black hole,

79
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.800
one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole and the other

80
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:52.420
will escape and become a real particle.
So the black hole is losing energy.

81
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.950
This happens incredibly slowly at first and gets faster as the black hole become

82
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:00.100
smaller.
When it arrives at the massive a large asteroid,

83
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.490
it's radiating it to room temperature.
When it has the massive amount in,

84
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.420
it radiates with about the heat of our son and in the last second of its life,

85
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.230
the black hole radiates away with the energy of the billions of nuclear bombs in

86
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:14.680
a huge explosion.
But this process is incredibly slow.

87
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.520
The biggest black holes we know might take up to eight Google old years to

88
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.780
evaporate.
This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away,

89
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.790
nobody will be around to witness it.

90
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.570
The universe will have become uninhabitable long before then.

91
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.580
This is not the end of our story.

92
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.100
There are loads more interesting ideas about black holes.

93
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.290
We'll explore them in part to

94
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.320
a big thanks to phrase it came for help with this video.
By the way,

95
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.980
we've made some coats cause we'll pay was in four k for different screen sizes.

96
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.750
You can get them on our page,
you on page,

97
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.630
which also helps us to make more videos like this.

98
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.390
December the first month ever with three videos.
