1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.670
Imagined you were alive back in the 1980s and were told the computers with Sim

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.750
take over everything from shopping to dating and the stock market,

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.860
that billions of people would be connected via kind of web,

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.320
that you would own a handheld device,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
orders of magnitude more powerful than super computers.
It would seem absurd,

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.010
but then all of it happened.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
Science fiction became our reality that we don't even think about it.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering,

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.560
so let's talk about it where it came from,

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
what we're doing right now and about a recent breakthrough that will change how

11
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.630
we live and what we perceive as normal forever.

12
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.470
<v 0>Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.</v>

14
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.090
Through selective breeding,
we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.

15
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.860
We became very good at this,

16
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.630
but never truly understood how it works until we discovered the code of life.

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.490
DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID DNA,
a complex molecule,

18
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:17.050
the guys of the growth,
development,

19
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:22.051
function and reproduction of everything alive information is encoded in the

20
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:23.200
structure of the molecule.

21
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.190
Four nucleotides are pad and make up a code that carries instructions,

22
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.900
change the instructions and you change the being carrying it.

23
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.920
As soon as DNA was discovered,
people tried to tinker with this.

24
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.050
In the 1960s scientists bombarded plants with radiation to cause random

25
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:42.580
mutations in the genetic code.

26
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.510
The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.

27
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.060
Sometimes it actually works too.

28
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.560
In the 70s scientists inserted DNA stuff.
It's a tobacco area,

29
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.030
plants and animals to study and modify them for research,
medicine,

30
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.770
agriculture,
and for fun.

31
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.430
The earliest genetically modified animal was born in 1974 making mice a standard

32
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:10.780
tool for research,
saving millions of lives.
Early eighties we got commercial.

33
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.740
The first patent was given for a microbe engineer to absorb oil.

34
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.870
Today we produce many chemicals by means of an engineered life like life saving,

35
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:22.480
clotting factors,
growth hormones and insulin.

36
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.990
All things we had to harvest from the organs of animals.
Before that,

37
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.530
the first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994 the flavor saver tomato,

38
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.130
a tomato given a much longer shelf life where an extra gene that suppressed the

39
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:37.600
buildup of a rotting enzyme,

40
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.400
but GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.

41
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.580
In the 1990s there was also a brief foray into human engineering to treat

42
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:49.660
maternal infertility.

43
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.400
Babies were made the carriage genetic information from three humans making them

44
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:57.370
the first humans ever to have three genetic parents.

45
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.620
Today there are muscled pigs,
fast growing salmon,
featherless chickens,

46
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.500
and see through frogs.
On the fund side.

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.450
We made things glow in the dark fluorescent to zebra.

48
00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:13.451
Fish are available for as little as $10 all of this is already very impressive,

49
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.190
but until recently,
gene editing was extremely expensive,
complicated,

50
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.510
and took a long time to do.

51
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.010
This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology.

52
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.730
Now entering the stage CRISPR overnight,

53
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.350
the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99% instead of a year.

54
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.580
It takes a few weeks to conduct experiments and basically everybody with a lab

55
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.580
can do it.
It's hard to get across.

56
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.040
How big a technical revolution CRISPR is.

57
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.490
It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.

58
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.110
Why did this sudden revolution happen and how does it work?

59
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.450
Bacteria and viruses have been fighting since the dawn of life.

60
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.200
So-Called bacteria phages or phages hunt bacteria in the ocean phages kill 40%

61
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.550
of them every single day.

62
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.530
Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking

63
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:13.030
them over to use them as factories.

64
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.530
The bacteria try to resist but fail most of the time because their protection

65
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:18.760
tools are too weak,

66
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.390
but sometimes bacteria survive and attack only if they do so can they activate

67
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.950
their most effective antivirus system?

68
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.770
They save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive

69
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:36.640
called crisper.
Here,
it's stored safely until it's needed.

70
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.980
When the virus had tanks.
Again,

71
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.680
the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms,

72
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:44.514
a secret weapon,

73
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.650
a protein called cas nine the protein now scans the bacteriums insights for

74
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:55.120
signs of the virus invader by comparing every bit of DNA at fines to the sample

75
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:59.110
from the archive.
When it finds a 100% perfect match,

76
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.250
it's activated and cuts out the virus DNA making it useless,

77
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.320
protecting the bacterium against the attack.

78
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.070
What's special is the cas nine is a very precise,

79
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.230
almost like eight DNA surgeon.

80
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.270
The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is

81
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:19.660
programmable.
You can just give it a copy of DNA.

82
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.570
You want to modify and put the system into a living cell.

83
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.990
If the old techniques of genetic manipulation where like a Mab.

84
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.160
Crispr is like a GPS system,
a summit from being precise,

85
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.270
cheap and easy.
Crispr offers the ability to edit live cells,

86
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.050
to switch genes on and off and target and study particular DNA.

87
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:42.580
Sequence six is also works for every type of cell,
micro organisms,

88
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.170
plants,
animals,
or humans.
But despite the revolution,

89
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:50.950
CRISPR is for science.
It's still just a first generation tall.

90
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.450
More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.

91
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.010
In 2015 scientists used CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from

92
00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:09.490
patients and the lab proving that it was possible.
Only about a year later,

93
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.450
they carried out a larger scale project with rats that had the HIV virus in

94
00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:15.070
basically all of their bodies house.

95
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.280
By simply injecting CRISPR into the ranch tails,

96
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.450
they were able to remove more than 50% of the virus from cells all over the
body.

97
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.010
In a few decades,

98
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.220
a crisper therapy might cure HIV and other retroviruses viruses that hide inside

99
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:33.340
human DNA like Herbie's could be eradicated this way.

100
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.200
Crispr could also defeat one of our worst enemies.
Cancer.

101
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.210
Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing

102
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.590
themselves from the immune system.

103
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.670
Crispr gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better.

104
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:49.510
Cancer Hunters,

105
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.040
getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections

106
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:57.640
of a few thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal

107
00:06:57.641 --> 00:06:58.474
you for good.

108
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.370
The first clinical trial for a crisper cancer treatment on human patients was

109
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:07.330
approved in early 2016 in the u s knows,
even a month later,

110
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.660
Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer patients with

111
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:13.600
immune cells modified with Crispr in August,

112
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.600
2016 things are picking up pace quickly and then there are genetic diseases,

113
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.360
there are thousands of them and they range from Marley annoying,

114
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.310
too deadly or Intel.
Decades of suffering with a powerful tool like CRISPR,

115
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.460
we may be able to end this over 3000 genetic diseases are caused by a single

116
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.930
incorrect letter in your DNA.

117
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.150
We are already building a modified version of CAS nine that is made to change

118
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.710
just a single letter fixing the disease in the south in a decade or two.

119
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.560
We could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever,

120
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.400
but all of these medical applications have one thing in common.

121
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.590
They are limited to the individual and die with them except if you use them on

122
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:58.990
reproductive cells or very early embryos.

123
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.860
But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more.

124
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.200
The creation of modified humans.

125
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:10.470
Designer babies and will mean gradual but irreversible changes to the human gene

126
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:11.554
pool.

127
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.070
The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exist there.

128
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:23.650
The technology is still in its early stages,

129
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.990
but it has already been attempted twice.

130
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.280
In 2015 and 2016 Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were

131
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.050
partially successful on their second attempt.

132
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.220
They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos,

133
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.100
but also that scientists are working on solving them.

134
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.700
This is like the computer in the 70s there will be better computers regardless

135
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:52.090
of your personal take on genetic engineering.
It will affect you.

136
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.510
Modified humans could alter the of our entire species because they're engineered

137
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.080
traits will be passed onto their children and could spread over generations

138
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.730
slowly modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.
It will start slowly.

139
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.940
The first designer babies will not be overly designed.

140
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.930
It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease

141
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.920
running in our family.
As the technology progresses and gets more refined,

142
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.060
more and more people may argue that knots using genetic modification is

143
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.590
unethical because it condemned children to preventable suffering and death and

144
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:30.360
denies them the cure.
But as soon as the first engineered kid is born,

145
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.260
a door is opened that can't be close to anymore.
Early on,

146
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.480
vanity traits will mostly be left alone,

147
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.500
but as genetic modification becomes more accepted and our knowledge of our

148
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:43.710
genetic code enhances,
the temptation will grow.

149
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.100
If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer,

150
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.040
why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?

151
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.140
Why not throw in perfect eyesight?
How about height or muscular structure?

152
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.700
Full hat.
How about giving your child the gift of extraordinary intelligence?

153
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.350
Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of

154
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:08.430
individuals that accumulate.
This is a slippery slope.

155
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.520
Modified humans could become the new standard,

156
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.570
but as engineering becomes more normal and our knowledge improves,

157
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.690
we could solve the single biggest mortality risk factor paging two thirds of the

158
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:25.590
150,000 people who die today will die of age related causes.

159
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.150
Currently,
we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to ourselves,

160
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.680
like DNA breaks and the system's responsible for fixing those wearing off over

161
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.580
time,
but there are also genes that directly affect teaching.

162
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.140
A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down

163
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:45.320
aging maybe even reverses.

164
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.990
We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.

165
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.320
Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.

166
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.570
Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually

167
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:01.380
just stops being a thing.
We would still die at some point,

168
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.680
but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90 we might be able to spend a few

169
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.650
thousand years with our loved ones.
Research into this is in its infancy

170
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.810
and many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.

171
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.500
The challenges are enormous and maybe it is unachievable,

172
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.720
but it is conceivable that people alive today might be the first to profit from

173
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:29.460
effective anti aging therapy or we might need is for someone to convince a smart

174
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.840
billionaire to make it.
Then next problem to solve on a bigger scale.

175
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.380
We certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population

176
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.040
engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high energy food,

177
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.870
eliminating many diseases of civilization like obesity in possession of a

178
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.870
modified immune system with a library of potential threats.

179
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.590
We might become immune to most diseases that haunts us today.

180
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.550
Even further into the future.

181
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.320
We could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel and to cope

182
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.060
with different conditions on other planets,

183
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.020
which would be extremely helpful in keeping us alive in our hostile universe.

184
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.110
Still a few major challenges.
The waiters,
some technological,
some ethical,

185
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.300
many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a

186
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:25.260
world in which we will reject non perfect humans and quick select features and

187
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.600
qualities based on our idea of what's healthy.

188
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.940
The thing is we are already living in this wild tests for dozens of genetic

189
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:36.900
diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in much of the

190
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:37.734
world.

191
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.630
Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defects can lead to the end of a
pregnancy.

192
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.500
Take Down Syndrome.
For example,
one of the most common genetic defects in Europe,

193
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.310
about 92% of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.

194
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.300
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is incredibly personal,

195
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.840
but it's important to acknowledge the reality that we are pre-selecting humans

196
00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:05.580
based on medical conditions.
There is also no use in pretending this will change,

197
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.230
so we have to act carefully and respectfully as we advanced the technology and

198
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:14.220
can make more and more selections.
But none of this will happen soon.

199
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.530
As powerful as Crispr is and it is,
it's not infallible yet.

200
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.030
Wrong edits still happen.
That's what,

201
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:26.040
as an unknown errors that can occur anywhere in the DNA and Mike go unnoticed.

202
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.360
The gene ad it might achieve the desired result disabling a disease,

203
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.600
but also might accidentally trigger unwanted changes.

204
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.070
We just don't know enough yet about the complex interplay of our genes to avoid

205
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:39.510
unpredictable consequences.

206
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.400
Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern.

207
00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:48.930
As the first human trials began and since we've discussed a possible positive

208
00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:49.440
future,

209
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.440
there are dark visions to imagine what a state like North Korea could do if they

210
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:58.220
embrace genetic engineering.
Could Estate Cement.

211
00:13:58.221 --> 00:14:01.500
It's rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects.

212
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.200
What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super

213
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:12.180
soldiers.
It is doable in theory,
scenarios like this one are far,

214
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:15.150
far off into the future if they ever become possible at all,

215
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.570
but the basic proof of concept for genetic engineering make,

216
00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:22.620
there's already exists today.
The technology ready is that powerful.

217
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.300
One of us might be a tempting reason to band genetic editing and related

218
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.310
research.
That would certainly be a mistake.

219
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.260
Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off

220
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:39.090
to a pace with jurisdiction and rules that we're uncomfortable with only by

221
00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:39.990
participating.

222
00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:43.440
Can we make sure that further research is guided by caution reason,

223
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.420
oversight and transparency.

224
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

225
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.590
<v 0>Do you feel uncomfortable now?</v>

226
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.940
Most of us have something wrong with them in the future that lies ahead of us.

227
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.460
Would we have been allowed to exist?

228
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.670
The technology is certainly a bit scary,

229
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.020
but we have a lot to gain and genetic engineering might just be a step in the

230
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.870
natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.

231
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.330
We might end disease.

232
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.160
We could extend our life expectancy by Sentras and traveled to the stars.

233
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.430
There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.

234
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.540
Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering,
the future is approaching,

235
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.540
no matter what.
What has been insane.

236
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.840
Science fiction is about to become our new reality.

237
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.040
A reality full of opportunities and challenges.

238
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.290
