1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.740
Consciousness as perhaps the biggest readily nature strip too.

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:09.150
It's cool meaning consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.150
surroundings and of our own in a state,

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.940
but thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us around in circles.

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.950
We all intuitively know what consciousness is.
It's this,

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.790
it's what you're experiencing here right now,

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.530
but once we tried to pinpoint just what exactly it is,

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.760
it leaves this grasping at thin air and not just us.

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
Philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.500
Different schools and ideas compete with one another,

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.200
but no one has come close to figuring it out.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
It's unsettling to realize that we don't understand what makes us aware of

13
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:55.820
ourselves and the world
in this fuzzy area.

14
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.700
Consciousness and intelligence are also related,

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.890
although they are not the same.

16
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.420
We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in

17
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.960
other videos like much of what makes us human.

18
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.160
Our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms.

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.950
As a product of evolution by natural selection,

20
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.620
it has probably emerged from an immense several hundred million years sequence

21
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.790
of countless micro steps that together make up a sort of gradient of

22
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:26.624
consciousness.

23
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.120
What was the first step on this path for the nonconscious to the basic

24
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:36.650
consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.640
enjoy today?

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.123
Take a stone.

27
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.580
The consensus is that a stone is not conscious though not everyone agrees.

28
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.430
Even on this,
some pans,

29
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.400
cyclists claimed that a lump of rock may have an inner life.

30
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.870
However,

31
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.670
there are no real grounds for any such assumption since stones never show

32
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.260
behavior that in a life can neither be proven nor disproven.

33
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
More common starting point is with the living things and living thing or a self

34
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind to do

35
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:25.380
so.

36
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380
It needs energy and this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.320
The original function of consciousness was probably to direct to a mobile self

38
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.530
that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food.

39
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.680
On the smaller scales of life.
You don't need to be aware to find food.

40
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.860
Trico plaques adherence,

41
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790
one of the simplest of all animals moves around haphazardly.

42
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.650
It slows down in the presence of food and speeds up and its absence.

43
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.640
This is highly effective and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there

44
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.650
is food than where there is not,

45
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.630
but it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target and

46
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.430
there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.

47
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.810
The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.090
started to move themselves directionally moving towards what was good for them,

49
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.970
save food and away from what was less good.

50
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.670
Say someone else who thought that they were food.

51
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.640
Take ECR to greener.
A tiny worm known for it's funny face.

52
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.300
Sometimes the worm is hungry and sometimes not.

53
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.550
This means that when it moves,

54
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.930
the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external

55
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.610
stimulus,
but that it's actions depend upon its inner physiological state,

56
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.800
whether it's hungry or sate it
when it's just eaten,

57
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.480
the worm is less energetic,

58
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.490
but when staff for awhile it will move itself in the direction of tasty things.

59
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.290
It uses chemo receptors on its head to smell it's environment and guided in the

60
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:18.571
direction whether center food is strongest after finding and eating a meal,

61
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.510
our one buddy heads back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety until

62
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:26.080
it's hungry again.

63
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.510
But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete

64
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:36.310
objective in view.
They still lack any sense of where they are heading.

65
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.580
So the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a

66
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.350
distance like vision,

67
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.090
vision adds context and depth to our world.

68
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.440
With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food existed.

69
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.230
It adds a whole new dimension to awareness and is a huge step towards more

70
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.550
familiar consciousness.

71
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600
An optical operators like an eye enables us to visualize our goal and lock onto

72
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.940
it,
but even at this stage,

73
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.230
a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it.

74
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.580
So the next logical step needs to happen on the inside to visualize food in its

75
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.140
absence.
For example,

76
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.550
herself needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world.

77
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.630
Now an animal can continue looking for food even when it escapes sits sensory

78
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.534
range.

79
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.310
Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world,

80
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.670
it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it ourself now exists in

81
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:51.631
a world it can get familiar with the ability to remember things has emerged

82
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.160
thanks to memory.

83
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.160
Animals can be distracted from a pursuit for a few but quickly continue their

84
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:00.050
path afterwards.

85
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.280
A related phenomenon is called object permanence.

86
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.680
This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't

87
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:10.514
see them.

88
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.040
This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds and perhaps other

89
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:21.041
animals to human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn

90
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.244
eight months.

91
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.150
While baby chickens show visibility within a day or two of being born,

92
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.470
the capacity to remember a thing and its absence suggests at least a basic sense

93
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.704
of time.

94
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.390
A sense of time is a big step on a ladder of consciousness.

95
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.730
It may also enable herself to look forward from the present moment and

96
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.440
anticipate the future.
Adult chickens,
for example,

97
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.280
are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a

98
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.130
bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while.

99
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.380
This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a

100
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:02.540
reward that only exist in the future,

101
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.380
which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.

102
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.970
Western Scrub Jays are experts in delayed gratification.

103
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.350
They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food and a

104
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.450
cache to retrieve it at a later date.

105
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.100
The Scrub Jays will even rehydrate their food if they become aware that a

106
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.020
potential thief has been watching them.

107
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.940
This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there who are

108
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:32.780
aware and see the world from their own different perspective.

109
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.120
Crafty Scrub Jays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds.

110
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.000
Visibility to mind read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness.

111
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.360
By putting yourself in the position of others,

112
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.460
you could out smarter rich competitor or empathize with a hungry friend.

113
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.470
Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absence to a

114
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:02.240
whole new level.
Words enabled us to construct hypotheses about the world,

115
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.220
make detailed plans,
and to communicate them with others.
Words,

116
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:12.221
enablers to think about ourselves and our place in the universe and even about

117
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.480
our own consciousness,
which is something we'll be doing more in future videos.

118
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.170
So what is the origin of our consciousness?

119
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.810
It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of

120
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:28.850
food with the survival benefits.

121
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:32.780
This gave it over competitors that moved at random all,
not at all.

122
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.190
It probably all started with the urge for more food.

123
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.530
So even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about
space,

124
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.770
build skyscrapers,
or obsess about novels,

125
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.270
it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next

126
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:52.520
meal.
Collectively,

127
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:57.410
we've put so much thought and ingenuity and to getting food that we can now just

128
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.230
get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.

129
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.520
