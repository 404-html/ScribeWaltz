00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
What would you say if we told you that humanity is currently making a

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.810
collaborative effort to engineer the perfect Super Bug,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
a bug the could kill hundreds of millions of people?
Well,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.110
it is happening right now.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.710
We are in the process of creating a super bacteria.

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.230
Bacteria are among the oldest living things on this Spanish.

7
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.570
The smallest thing we still consider life.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.960
They are masters of Civil Evil and can be found everywhere.

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.780
Most bacteria are harmless to us.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.260
Your body hosts trillions of them and they help you to survive,

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.050
but others can invade your body spread quickly and kill you.

12
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.930
Millions of people used to die as a result of bacterial infections until we

13
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:54.430
developed a super weapon antibiotics together with vaccinations,

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.240
antibiotics revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives.

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.050
Antibiotics killed the vast majority of susceptible bacteria.

16
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:05.890
Fatty quickly leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system

17
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.550
then deals with easily.
How do antibiotics do this?

18
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.170
Imagine a bacterium as a very complex machine with thousands of complex

19
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.720
processes going on that keeps it alive and active.

20
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.770
Antibiotics disrupt this complex machinery,
for example,

21
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.540
by interfering with its metabolism,

22
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.080
slowing down their growth significantly so they are less of a threat,

23
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.310
other antibiotics attack DNA and prevent it from being replicated,

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.290
which stops bacteria from multiplying,

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.000
ultimately killing them all by simply repping the outer layer of the bacteria to

26
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.120
shreds so that their insights spill out and they die quickly.

27
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.330
All of this without bothering body cells,

28
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.470
but now evolution is making things more complicated.

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.810
By pure random chance.

30
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.160
A small minority of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved away to

31
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:56.200
protect themselves.
For example,

32
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.430
by intercepting the antibiotics and changing the molecule so it becomes harmless

33
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.530
all by investing energy in pumps that ejects the antibiotics before they can do

34
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.364
damage.

35
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.570
The few immune bacteria are not that big a deal because the immune system can

36
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:15.070
take care of them,
but if they escape,
they might spread their immunity.

37
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.910
How can bacteria spread immunity?
First of all,

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.130
bacteria have two kinds of DNA.

39
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.730
The chromosome and small free floating pants called plasmids.

40
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.280
They can hug each other and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful
abilities.

41
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.570
This way.

42
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.470
Immunity can be spread quickly through a population or in a process called

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.030
transformation.
Bacteria can harvest a dead bacteria and collects DNA pieces.

44
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920
This even works between different bacteria species and can lead to super bugs.

45
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.250
Bacteria that are immune to multiple antibiotics.

46
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.820
A variety of superbugs already exist in the world,

47
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.270
especially hospitals are the perfect breeding grounds for them.

48
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.990
Humans have short memories.
The horrors,

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.260
the pre antibiotic era have been forgotten today.

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.730
We treat this powerful medicine as a commodity instead of as the game changing

51
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.080
achievement of sons that it is.
This has led to a strange disconnect.

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.950
Hundreds of millions of people still don't have access to antibiotics in

53
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.740
developing countries.
One in other parts of the world,

54
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.890
antibiotics are prescribed to freely and taken where cat antibiotics should be a

55
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.010
last resort drug,
not something you take because you're cold is annoying.

56
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.660
Another serious problem is antibiotic use in meat production.

57
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.850
At any particular point in time,

58
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.070
humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion animals as livestock to make me

59
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:43.990
cheaper.
Many animals are held in horrible conditions in very tight spaces and an

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.740
unhygienic conditions.
The perfect breeding ground for a disease.

61
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.440
So many animals are given antibiotics to kill as many bacteria as possible and

62
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.040
prevent them from getting sick because the cheeseburger has to cost a dollar.

63
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.100
Unsurprisingly,
as a result of this system,

64
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.330
we have created more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

65
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.860
To counteract this,

66
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.430
we use different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon.

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.690
There are specific antibiotics that I use to wipe out bacteria that have

68
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.770
developed resistance.

69
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.600
There are strict rules for using these to avoid the creation of a super bacteria

70
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.820
or so we thought,

71
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.390
and late 2015 scary news arrived from China Resistance Against Colistin.

72
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.250
A last ditch antibiotic had been discovered.

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.330
Colistin is an old drug and was rarely used because it can damage the liver,

74
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.730
so there was little resistance against it,

75
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.730
which made it a great antibiotic of last resort.

76
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.020
For certain complex infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that

77
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:46.150
have become immune to a whole bunch of other drugs,

78
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.470
bacteria resistance to Colistin is very,
very bad news.

79
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.060
It might destroy a last line of defense and the to a whole lot of dead people.

80
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.650
How could this happen?

81
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.000
Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms have been given Colistin for years.

82
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.080
Resistant bacteria develops spreading first from animal to animal and then to

83
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:08.440
humans without being noticed.
On an average day,

84
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.790
there are over 100,000 flights on earth kind of connecting every human on the

85
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.700
planet.
By creating the modern world,

86
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.260
we have also built the infrastructure for a dangerous pandemic.
Still,

87
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:25.120
we don't need to panic just yet.
Bacteria evolve humans to research.

88
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.480
New Antibiotics aren't developed as old ones become obsolete.

89
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.010
Technology is advancing every day.
The problem is real and serious,

90
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.600
but the fight is far from over.

91
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.670
If humanity plays its cards right superbugs and might turn out to be not very

92
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:40.780
super.
