00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.560
So have you ever wondered who actually invented the Internet?

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.310
Some people have become Zilli days thanks to the Internet,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.670
but all they did was invent clever ways of using the internet.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
So the person who invented the Internet should be a gazillionaire equivalent to

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.310
see God,
shouldn't they?
Who should get the credit then?

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.100
Was it a British key?
Can a Swiss underground neighbor,

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.600
maybe clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.980
Nice idea.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
French scientist who decided to call that computer network the [inaudible] on
it.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.933
Interesting.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart scientists working on something they knew

12
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.710
was useful but didn't realize would be so big?

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.820
Well,
let's try and get some facts straight.
There's the Internet,

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.670
the whole bunch of computer networks connected to each other,

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.950
and then there's the worldwide web,

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.780
a way of making it easier to share information using all those interconnected

17
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:07.990
computers.
The Internet,
as we know it today,

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.210
was at least 40 years in the making.

19
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.610
One popular but wrong story is that the Internet was developed by the u s so

20
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:19.180
they had a communication that work that would survive a nuclear war.

21
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.150
According to one of the founders of the first network,

22
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.620
the arpanet and the 1960s this first network experiment wasn't about

23
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:31.450
communication at all.
It was about optimizing process or usage or timesharing,

24
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.020
which basically meant that scientists could share computer power to.

25
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
That was because until the 1960s there was basically no network.

26
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.590
You had big machines called mainframes,

27
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.370
which Saturday Roman and processed computing tasks one at a time.

28
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.990
With time sharing these bare mosques could process several tasks at a time,

29
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.200
which meant that power could be used by several scientists at once and obviously

30
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.670
once you start connecting computers together,

31
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.020
you start to wonder about what you need to do to make communications between

32
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:06.610
them,
easier scientists around the world.
We're trying to solve this problem.

33
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.630
So let's look at some of the other key concepts that were developed elsewhere.

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.110
Starting with packet switching in Britain,

35
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.740
there was a commercial network developed by the national physical laboratory,

36
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.980
but which never really got off the ground because it didn't get funding,

37
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.280
but they did come up with the idea of packet switching,

38
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.960
a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks by cussing update on one end and

39
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:33.160
putting it back together at the other.
The French also played a role.

40
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.730
They were working on a scientific network called [inaudible],

41
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.620
but they didn't have a big budget,

42
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.510
so they decided to work on direct connections between computers as opposed to

43
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:47.140
working with gateway computers.
Now,
as an aside here,

44
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.190
this admittedly isn't very scientific,
but according to one theory,

45
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.910
a spit off of their research was the word and tack on Net,

46
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.370
but you don't have to believe it if you don't want to.

47
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.680
So now it's the early 1970s there's quite a lot of computer infrastructure,

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.030
but communication is awkward and patchy because different networks can't talk to

49
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:10.930
each other.
TCP Ip solves this problem.

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.610
The TCP Ip protocols form the basic communication language of the Internet,

51
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.930
which labels the packets of data and make sure that even though some pieces of

52
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.490
the same data take a different route,

53
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.030
they all arrive at their destination and can be reassembled.

54
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.720
Networks really began communicating with each other in 1975 so you could argue

55
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.020
that was the beginning of the Internet.
Email was also very important.

56
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.260
It was developed for Arpanet in 1972 most internet traffic in 1976 was email

57
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.830
because academics thought electronic posted notes were dead call with networks

58
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:50.110
that could talk to each other.
Communication was becoming easier,

59
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.480
but all this communication was just text based and it was pretty ugly to look
at.

60
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.220
In the 1980s of Bret called Timothy Berners Lee spent time with cern,

61
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.690
the European Organization for nuclear research where physicists are trying to

62
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.110
work out what the universe is made of.

63
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.410
He wanted to manage the scientist's information and make it possible for them to

64
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.800
shat and interconnect their work easily,
making progress.

65
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.690
More likely he did.
So by inventing an interface using http,

66
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.860
html,
and URLs that made internet browsers possible.

67
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.960
He called his browser the worldwide web,
so he didn't invent the Internet,

68
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.270
but he did invent the web.

69
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.140
The first ever website which he created was at cern in France in August,

70
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.420
1991 so once the initial infrastructure was in place,

71
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.370
the key technologies had been invented.

72
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.480
Internet message boards exploded in the 1980s the phone companies saw the

73
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:50.830
commercial potential of digital communication.
Web Browser spread like wildfire.

74
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:55.810
In the early 1990s and ordinary people discovered email then the internet

75
00:04:55.811 --> 00:05:00.811
expanded rapidly and steadily and became workable for the masses from about 1995

76
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.650
hold on,
didn't us,
vice president Al Gore invented the Internet.
Ah,

77
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:09.130
no.
And if you read what he said exactly,

78
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.470
you'd know he never claimed to have done,

79
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.910
but many people credit him with energetically pushing legislation that

80
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.680
encouraged the spread of the Internet.

81
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.030
The Internet exists because we need to communicate,

82
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.250
and most of us like doing it.

83
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.150
That's why humans have become the dominant species on earth.

84
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.310
You could argue that the Internet is a natural evolutionary step and a

85
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.410
manifestation of that need.

86
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.530
It wasn't invented by anyone in particular,

87
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.640
but when the building blocks were put together by all those cool scientists from

88
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.940
all over the place,
the Internet became a communication tool,

89
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.650
a retail tool or research tool of propaganda,
tall,
a spying tool,

90
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.130
a shopping tool,
a dating tool,
an entertainment tool,

91
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.100
and a way of skiving off work.
Well,
making it look like you're,
or studying,

92
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.690
which is what you may be doing now.
Ultimately though your communicating,

93
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.310
especially if you leave a comment and that might make you a better human being.

94
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>
