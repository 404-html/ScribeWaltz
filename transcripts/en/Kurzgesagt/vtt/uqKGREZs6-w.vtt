1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
From hostile deserts to loan the islands and the highest mountains,

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.680
wherever there is space to expand into humans do so.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.570
So it's hardly surprising that we're already making preparations to set foot on

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.470
Mars and to create the first permanent colony outside of earth.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
Maybe even terraforming other planets and turn it into a second,
the blue home,

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260
but wait,
before we can get to the nice future staff,

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.370
we first have to complete the second phase of colonization that creating a

8
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:33.450
semipermanent outpost to prepare the ground for a larger human presence,

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.390
but doing so we'll beat gruesome.

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.453
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.560
<v 0>Even for an expansionist species like us,</v>

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.150
Mars is extreme at first glance,
Mars seems for me.
Yeah.

13
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.460
The ice caps,
large valleys,

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.360
liquid water under its surface and a day barely longer than earth.

15
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.170
The ideal place for us to go,
unfortunately,

16
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:09.171
Mars is actually a cold radio active desert where the ground is poisonous and

17
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.780
breathing is impossible.
Mars is awful.

18
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.690
You almost certainly don't want to go there.

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.840
The pioneer's doing the hard work on Mars,

20
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.560
we'll have an intensely stressful life filled with incredibly challenging

21
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.750
problems.
Never encountered before,

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.040
but there are plenty of people willing to do that work and we have the

23
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.580
technology to enable them to do it.
For this video,

24
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
we will assume they have been prior missions to Mars to scout out a good pace

25
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:38.970
for an outpost store,
resources and equipment,

26
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
and that there's already a moon base that serves as a hub for Mars missions.

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.770
The first major challenge for our outpost is the fact that Mars is very energy.

28
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.480
Paul,
because of its distance from the sun,

29
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
solar power is only 40% as effective as on earth,

30
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.670
but even this weekend,

31
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.750
some nice is often obscured for days by enormous dust storms.

32
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.900
Solar power alone will probably not be enough.

33
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.390
Alternatives such as wind power and geothermal energy are also unfeasible as

34
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:14.100
there's hardly any atmosphere and Mars is interior is much too cold.

35
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.880
Initially,
nuclear technology might be the only option.

36
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.720
Since Mars doesn't have it easily accessible radioactive elements,

37
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.170
the nuclear fuel needs to come from Earth along with the reactor.

38
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000
If we do set it up,
it could power how small outpost for the first few years.

39
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.830
Unfortunately all that energy wouldn't be very useful if we can't breathe.

40
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.200
Mars's atmosphere is only 1% as dense as us and mostly made up of Sio two.

41
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.521
So wow.

42
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:45.870
Habitats need to be pressurized and filled with an artificial atmosphere made of

43
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:50.100
nitrogen and oxygen,
which comes with more problems,
corners,

44
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.650
and flat walls and weak points.
So the habitats,

45
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.400
we'll have rounded and smooth shapes to handle the stress of great pressure

46
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.950
differences between the interior and exterior.

47
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.770
The airlocks need to be very antisocial and work perfectly every time without an

48
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.600
extensive mag nitas fail or a dense atmosphere,

49
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.780
half of all radiation coming from space reaches the ground.

50
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.550
A person on the surface would be subjected to 50 times the radiation that they

51
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.480
would be on earth.

52
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.880
Three years on the surface of Mars exceeds the radiation dose limits imposed on

53
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.160
NASA astronauts for their entire career.

54
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.560
This increases cancer risks significantly.
To prevent that.

55
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.820
We could shield our habitats with a thick layer of frozen CO2 that can be

56
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.830
harvested directly from the atmosphere.

57
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.120
Covering the dry ice with a meter of dirt would further increase the level of

58
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.070
protection.
Sadly,
this means almost no windows from the inside.

59
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.060
Most living spaces will be window.
This tunnels from the outside,

60
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.920
they'll look like burial mounds.

61
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.980
All of this would still not hold back all the radiation,

62
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.960
but reduce it just enough to be survivable for long periods of time.
It won't,

63
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.840
however,
protect anyone who ventures outside.

64
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.580
So remote controlled robots we use for routine work on the surface while our

65
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:11.260
crew stays in sight.
Staying inside is a good idea.
For another reason,

66
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.500
Mazda dust,

67
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.930
it's much finer than dust on earth so it could find its way into the gears or

68
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.620
electronics of our machines because it's also very dry.

69
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.030
It's electrostatically charged,
sticking to everything like spacesuits.

70
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.280
It will be impossible to avoid carrying.

71
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:31.930
Lots of Mazda asked into our habitats and into the lungs of our crew to make

72
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:36.670
this even worse.
Mars,
his sword is filled with very toxic perchlorate salts.

73
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.190
Constant exposure could be deadly.

74
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.360
This problem can still be overcome though space suits,
for example,

75
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.920
could be made in a way that they never truly entered the base,

76
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.900
but stay attached to the outside of the habitats.
Okay,
great.

77
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.290
Now we've safety isolated humans in terms of energy and air and protected them

78
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:58.630
from cancer.
We just need to feed them water.

79
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:02.160
Is it easy to come by if a settlement is positioned near the Martian poles,

80
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.610
but they're thick layers of ice?

81
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.030
Growing food is a different kind of challenge though Mazda's soils are alkaline

82
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.490
and let the vital nitrogen compounds that plants need to grow before we can grow

83
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.650
anything.
We will have to decontaminate the soil,

84
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.540
which is difficult and expensive.

85
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.340
Then this all can be fertilized using recycled biological waste.

86
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.450
All of this will take a lot of time and is very energy intensive,

87
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.320
so we might use aquaponics to raise fish and plants together,

88
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.790
making the astronauts diets more varied and tasty at the same time.

89
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.350
This will be an important psychological boost for our overworked crew.

90
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.400
All of these things don't solve one fundamental problem though.

91
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.420
Mars has only 38% of earth's surface gravity,

92
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.070
which could cause muscle wasting bone loss and cardiovascular problems.

93
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.060
While this might be solved in the future by setting up rotating living spaces

94
00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.690
for now,

95
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.690
our crew has to live with low gravity and exercise a lot to slow the degradation

96
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.410
down the cruise.

97
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:10.550
We'll probably have to rotate every few years after being stuck in doors,

98
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.500
in tight spaces without windows,

99
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.740
with the same people performing the same routines day in,

100
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.741
day out with little contact from the outside world and a lot to worry about like

101
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.260
Antarctic scientists or submarine staff,

102
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.370
they will undergo intense psychological screening to make sure they're mentally

103
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.520
resilient enough to handle this lifestyle for several years.

104
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.700
Establishing the first real infrastructure on Mars,

105
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:39.170
we'll be extremely taxing work that only a group of very determined and

106
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:40.550
competent people can do.

107
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.110
Luckily we have enough of these on earth and there you have it,

108
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.240
a small Mars base that will survive for at least a few decades as long as it's

109
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:53.390
getting eight constant supply of resources,
parts,

110
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:57.080
nuclear fuel and cruise from Earth.
Unfortunately,

111
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.760
Mars and earth are separated by millions of kilometers and orbital periods that

112
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.760
leave only a narrow travel window every two years.

113
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.430
If there's an emergency in the colony,

114
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.790
earth wouldn't be able to help until the next travel window opens.

115
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.150
Helpers may arrive on a planet filled with carbs is settling bars.

116
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:19.190
That will be the toughest challenge we have ever faced.

117
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.910
It will be gruesome work to establish the infrastructure we need,

118
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.330
but we're stubborn and we like extreme challenges.

119
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.410
If we pushed through phase two of colonization,
anything is possible.

120
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.220
Cities illuminating the dark Martian night,
the hub,

121
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.490
the travel between the planets,
industries,
setting foot in all ways.

122
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.520
Terraforming a true multiplanetary future.

123
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.650
Going to Mars is hard but worth it and if we're lucky,

124
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.970
we might be around long enough to see it happening and cheer on the people who

125
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:53.510
take on these challenges for the benefit of a soul.

126
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.360
Figuring out complex stuff is one of the best feelings ever,

127
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.060
especially if you don't have to do it all by yourself.

128
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.730
Our friends from brilliant can help you out with that part.

129
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.900
Brilliant is a problem solving website with a hands on approach.

130
