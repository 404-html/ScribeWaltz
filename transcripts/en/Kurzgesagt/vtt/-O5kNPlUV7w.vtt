1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.230
A lot of things can be beautiful landscapes,

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.010
faces fine art or epic architecture,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.310
stars in the sky or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle,

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.150
but is nothing tangible.
It only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling.

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.920
If we have to define it,
we perceive something as beautiful.
If it's color,
shape,

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.820
form,
or proportion somehow are appealing or delightful to us.

7
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.350
Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.830
Even our first tools with trem two asymmetrical shape.

9
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.630
Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the

10
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:44.260
time to make that tools look nice,
but couldn't really identify any.

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.940
It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops simply because they

12
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:52.740
liked them better that way.
Throughout our history,

13
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:54.900
the definition of beauty has changed.
A lot.

14
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.320
Ideals have shifted or turned into that opposite,

15
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.680
but beyond individual and contemporary tastes,

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
some things have never really gone out of fashion.
The golden ratio,

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.960
symmetry or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of

18
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.120
cultures.
From our beginnings to today.

19
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.030
Humans seem to be in mysterious,

20
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.790
inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things.

21
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.540
The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.610
They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive.

23
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.063
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.560
<v 0>[inaudible] patterns,
for example,
occur all over nature in snail shells,</v>

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.870
flower heads,
waves or clouds.

26
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.150
Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital.

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.130
Do those clouds been rain will come soon?
Are these water's safe to swim through?

28
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.170
Can I eat this?
Another pervasive thing is symmetry in nature.

29
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.210
It means everything is as it should be,

30
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.110
stems and trees and leaves and blossoms or grow symmetrically.

31
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.280
The Dia with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat.

32
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.400
AIDS are formed.
Wheat here may not be safe to eat.

33
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.650
Asymmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile meeting

34
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.550
partner because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora.

35
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.800
It's extremely familiar to our brain.

36
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.050
It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily and react quickly

37
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:29.030
to danger.
Things that help us survive,
activate the reward center in our brain,

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.500
recognizing signals of safety and nutrition trigger nice feelings in us.

39
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.580
So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition,

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.980
but it goes way beyond that.
Now,

41
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.870
humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into

42
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:48.890
us.
It remains even after other processes in our brains stop working

43
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.960
Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings.

44
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.710
Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later.

45
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.670
The patients long since forgotten the paintings,

46
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.640
but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order.

47
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.190
One could argue that this doesn't say much,

48
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.800
so what if people stick to their personal preferences?

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.480
But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator

50
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.270
when it comes to beauty.
In different experiments,

51
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.570
people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings.

52
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.040
Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict

53
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.570
rules like fractal patterns.

54
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.040
While the invitations were not the majority picked out the original artworks.

55
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.630
This worked with paintings from both artists even though their styles are very

56
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.740
different.
Another experiment also used abstract works,

57
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.670
but ask people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children

58
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.200
or animals.
Again,

59
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.800
the test subjects' pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were Cafferty

60
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.300
planned and not random.

61
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.730
So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what is based on,

62
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.380
we somehow recognize it when we see us.

63
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.550
Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore.

64
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.730
We left the natural world behind and created our own.

65
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.980
We made the objects that surround us,
the things we wear and use and look at.

66
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.040
As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew,

67
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.810
we shaped a completely manmade environment.
In the process of doing so,

68
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.400
we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality,
cost or efficiency.

69
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.990
We built rows and rows of concrete housing blogs that nobody wants to live in.

70
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.870
We have ugly underground subway stations,

71
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.080
shabby public service buildings and sprawling malls.

72
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560
One bland standardized box beside the next,
she winds don't like monotony.

73
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.350
Eye Tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and the

74
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.940
ordinance of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls and not Tonia.

75
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:53.050
They know fun to look at.

76
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.310
They actually make us miserable experiments with skin sensors showed that

77
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.390
looking at vast dole facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable.

78
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.950
This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels and

79
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.070
the opposite seems to be true too.
Over the last decades,

80
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.010
more and more studies have found that surroundings that aren't actually

81
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.790
aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our wellbeing,
our behavior,

82
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500
cognitive function and mood.

83
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.390
Now bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds

84
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:23.224
us.

85
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.460
Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our wellbeing that making

86
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.310
useful things beautiful can actually make them better.

87
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.090
In 2017 a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews

88
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:40.480
with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas make them more

89
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.000
comfortable and happier about their stay.
In general.

90
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.190
Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two

91
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.690
worlds,
a very old and rather ugly one and a newly renovated ward.

92
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.370
To the researchers.
Surprise.

93
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.130
The patients that stayed in the new renovated environment needed less pain

94
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.580
medication and were released on average two days earlier than patients

95
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.050
recovering in the old ward.

96
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.650
More beautiful surroundings made them feel better physically,

97
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.250
but also has an effect on us on a daily basis.

98
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.230
It can improve our general habitats.

99
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.400
A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults

100
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:21.050
revealed an unexpected result beside things like good health and a harmonious

101
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:21.710
family life.

102
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.970
Individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in.

103
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.600
Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety.

104
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.940
So what can we learn from all of this?

105
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.530
We know that we humans have been fine tuned for millions of years to process

106
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:39.930
visual input and assess our surroundings.

107
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.610
It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how

108
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:47.580
much beauty as a property is really influencing us.

109
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.570
Beauty meets and inherent need for meaningful information.

110
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.520
Maybe it will be worth giving it more space in this manmade world we have

111
00:06:56.521 --> 00:06:57.354
created.

112
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.380
<v 0>This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies optimize to and wash</v>

114
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.620
as a contribution to that upcoming beauty exhibition.

115
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.690
The exhibition will be shown at the Mark Vienna from October the 23rd 2018 until

116
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:16.691
March the 31st 2019 and the Mark Frankfurt from May the first until September

117
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.950
30th,
2019 if you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of

118
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.700
gorgeous installations and multimedia objects,
go check it out.
