1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.660
Awesome are ridiculous and unbelievably small.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.350
A single human hair is about as thick as 500,000 carbon atoms stacked over each

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:11.580
other.
Look at your fist.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240
It contains trillions and trillions of atoms.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.550
If one atom and it were about as big as a model,
how big would your face be?
Well,

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.720
about the size of earth.
Still hard to imagine.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.250
Let's try something different.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.110
Look at your little finger.

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.740
Imagined that it's tear is as big as the room you're sitting in right now.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.500
Now fill the room with grains of rice.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.830
One rice corn represents one cell of your fingertip.

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.200
Now let's zoom in on the rice corn,

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.190
and now one cell is as big as the room you're in right now.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
Let's fill it with rice again,
this is about the size of a protein,

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.120
and now let us feel all the empty spaces between the rice corns with fine grains

16
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:00.954
of sand.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.170
This is roughly how small atoms are warranted as an asam Maydoff.

18
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.200
Let us just pretend that atoms look like this for a minute.

19
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.090
To make it easier to understand,
an atom consist of three elementary particles,

20
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.180
neutrons,
protons and electrons.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Protons and neutrons bind together and form the atom core held together by the

22
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:27.660
strong interaction,
one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.

23
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.800
They are made from quarks and held together by glue ons.

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.590
Nobody knows exactly how small carbs are.

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
We think they might literally be points like in geometry,

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.280
try to imagine them as being zero dimensional.

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.720
We suspect the quarks and electrons are the most fundamental components of

28
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.290
matter in the universe.
Electrons or the ASM call,

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
they travel at the speed of about 2,200 kilometers per second,

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.260
fast enough to get around the earth in just over 18 seconds.
Late quarks,

31
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.320
we think electrons are fundamental particles.

32
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680
99.999 (999) 999-9999 9% of an atom as volume.

33
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.660
There's just empty space except that it isn't.

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.320
What we perceive as entities is actually a space filled by quantum fluctuations.

35
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.460
Fields that have potential energy and build and dissolve spontaneously.

36
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
These fluctuations have a fundamental impact on how charged particles interact,

37
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.150
but that's a topic for another video.
How much space to the core and electrons.

38
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.110
Actually Phil,

39
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.310
if you were to subtract all the spaces between the atom cause from the empire

40
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.980
state building,
it would be about as big as a rice corn.

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.580
All the atoms of humanity would fit in a teaspoon.

42
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.010
There are extreme objects where states like this actually exist in a neutron

43
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:54.750
star atom cause our compacted so densely that the mass of three sons fits into

44
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:58.050
an object only a few kilometers wide.
By the way,

45
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.220
what do atoms look like?
Well,
kind of like this,

46
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.420
electrons are like a wave function and a particle.
At the same time,

47
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.350
we can calculate where an electron might be at any given moment in time.

48
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.180
These clouds of probability called orbitals are where electrons might be with a

49
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
certainty of 95% the probability of finding an electron approaches zero the

50
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:25.420
further we get away from the atom call,
but it actually never is zero,

51
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.190
which means that in theory the electron of an atom could be on the other side of

52
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.090
the universe.
Okay,
wait a second.
These strange thing,

53
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.380
his make up all the master in the universe for many dozens of known animals.

54
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.020
You don't need many dozens of elementary particles,

55
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.830
just three take one proton and one electron,

56
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.460
and you have hydrogen and a proton and a neutron.

57
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.490
You have helium and a few more.
You get carbon,
a few more fluoride,

58
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.990
even more gold and so on.

59
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.600
And every atom of an element is the same.
All hydrogen atoms in the universe,

60
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.950
for example,
are the same.

61
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.480
The hydrogen and your body is exactly the same as the hydrogen and the sun.

62
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.900
Do you feel confused right now?
We certainly do.

63
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.500
Nothing on this scale of the universe makes any sense in our world,

64
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.620
and we've not even begun talking about quantum mechanics or the particle zoo,

65
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.780
which are even stranger.

66
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.340
Our model of atoms has changed a number of times since we first conceived it,

67
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.980
and the current one will certainly not be the last.

68
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.110
So let us support scientists and research and wait for the next wave of mind

69
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:36.880
boggling new information about this strange world that is the basis for our

70
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.570
existence.
