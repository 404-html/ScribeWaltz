1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.940
Let's shrink an elephant to the size of a mouse and in large amounts and make it

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.030
the size of an elephant because this is our video and we want to see what

3
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.770
happens first hour.
Now tiny elephant stumbles around and then drops dead.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.730
Tiny elephant buddy is very cold,
frozen to death in minutes.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.290
Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable for a moment and then it explodes

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.590
leaving hot mouse insides everywhere.
Why?

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.510
Because of size.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.680
We are optimized to function precisely for the science we are and would die

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.950
horribly in any other environment,
but why exactly?

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.260
Why does our mouse explode and can we do this to our elephant too if we try hard

11
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.990
life on this planet is based on cells.
Cells do vary in size,

12
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.990
but they're pretty similar in their dimensions across all species.

13
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.140
A blue whale doesn't have bigger sales than a hummingbird,

14
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.270
just a lot more often sells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive and they

15
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.270
need energy to be able to do so.
To get this energy,

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
animal cells convert food and oxygen into usable chemical energy.

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.950
This happens in our Mitochondria,
the powerhouse of the cell.

18
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.110
They're like little call engines that spit out tiny ATP batteries,

19
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.700
which the cell can use for almost everything it needs to do.
Just like an engine.

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
Mitochondria get ready hot while working in human skin cells.

21
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.140
They reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius and some of ourselves have up to 2000

22
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.060
Mitochondria which are radiating that heat and to the south.

23
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.160
So being alive generates a lot of heat.
The more cells you have,

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.110
the more heat your body generates.
In total,

25
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.290
if our bodies didn't find ways of losing this heat,

26
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.750
we would be cooked from the inside and die.

27
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.280
But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way he bought his
change.

28
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.750
His living being scaled up.

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.280
Animals have three properties here that are important that length,

30
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.150
their outsides or skin and their insights like organs,

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.650
bones and hopes and dreams.

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.430
The thing that's hard to wrap your head around is that when things grow,

33
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.590
their insides grow faster than their outsides.
Imagine a fleshy cube.

34
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.090
If you double the length of its sides,
it's surface and volume do not double.

35
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.230
In fact,

36
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.310
the surface is now four times the original size and the volume of the cube eight

37
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.660
times the original size,

38
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.880
which is called the square cube law and has been annoying nature for billions of

39
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.120
years.
So why is this a problem for big animals?

40
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.780
Because heat can only leave an object via its surface.

41
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.340
So if we make our mouse the size of an elephant or 60 times longer,

42
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
it has 3,600 times more surface from which to lose heat.

43
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
But it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions and trillions of new

44
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.130
hot mitochondria that produce more heat,
a lot more insights,

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.430
not that much more skin.
Our mouse is very dead,
very fast,

46
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.310
barn to big things like elephants exist.
So how do they deal with the heat?

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.210
For one,
they evolved ways to get rid of energy more easily.

48
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
Like huge flat is that have a lot of surface where heat can escape,

49
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.490
but that's not enough.
Nature's solution is actually very elegant.

50
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.600
Elephant cells are much,
much slower than myself.

51
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.400
The bigger an animal is,
the less active it's cells.

52
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.850
Or if we classify animals by their metabolic rates and compare that to their

53
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:38.410
overall mass.
It's clearly visible.
It's not 100% accurate,

54
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.060
but it is a good rule of thumb.

55
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.070
Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal

56
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:45.760
ovens,

57
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.780
so they keep the oven's just active enough to keep the running and never at full

58
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.780
power.
Their whole metabolism is slow.

59
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.330
Things move at a nice chill pace.

60
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.860
Small animals need to go the exact opposite way.
If you're small,

61
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.680
you have a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume.

62
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.750
You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat.
They produce very fast,

63
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.980
so very tiny mammals came up with a very extreme solution.

64
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.820
Meet the a trust can true the smallest mammal on earth.

65
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.870
The mold like thing that's more closely related to hedgehogs than to mice.

66
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.330
With the body length of four centimeters,

67
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.310
it only weighs about 1.8 grams as much as it Pedro Cape.
It's a tiny,

68
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.270
ridiculous being.

69
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.980
It would basically cool off immediately so it's cells run on overdrive to stay

70
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.730
warm.
It's tiny.
Ovens are filled at maximum capacity.

71
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.031
It's hard to be,

72
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:41.980
it's up to 1200 times a minute and it brings up to 800 times a minute.

73
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.860
This creates an extreme need for energy,

74
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.330
so the shrew has to eat constantly after only four hours without food.

75
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.500
It starves to death.

76
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.630
And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight in food each

77
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.160
day,
our shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive.

78
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.110
Imagine having to eat 2000 big Max a day,

79
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.800
more than one a minute fun for awhile,

80
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
but then not so much so a cubic centimeter of shrew needs at 40 times more food

81
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.240
than a cubic centimeter of elephant.

82
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.170
If an elephant cells certainly become as active as the cells of a shrew,

83
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.900
a crazy amount of heat would be generated.

84
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.950
All the liquids and the elephant would suddenly start boiling and then it would

85
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.951
explode in an impressive explosion of steaming hot burning and often parts in

86
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.060
reality,
before an explosion occurred,

87
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.960
the proteins making up house sellers would probably beat natures and stop

88
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.794
producing heat,

89
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.640
but a meet exposion as much more fun than melting and elephant into a massive

90
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:41.890
hot glue.
Regardless,

91
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.890
the scaling of the speed of metabolism happens everywhere.

92
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.130
Even in places we don't expect,
like pregnant women,

93
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.220
a baby in the womb of his mother behaves as if it were a part of her itselves

94
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.790
have about the same metabolic rate,

95
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.380
the same speed of life as it's mother's organs.

96
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
It is truly a part of a bigger whole rather than an individual until it's not

97
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:06.730
anymore.
The very moment a baby is born,
a switches,

98
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.800
Flint and audits internal processes speed up rapidly,

99
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.920
36 hours after birth.
The baby's cells have the same activity rate as a mammal.

100
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.754
It's size.

101
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.620
They've is literally transition from being an organ to being an individual in

102
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.120
mere hours.
But there's one thing where big and small things are very similar.

103
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.283
Heartbeat.

104
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.370
Mammals tend to have a similar amount of heartbeats over their lifetime,

105
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.410
typically around 1 billion,

106
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.830
so while the shrew and elephant are very different,

107
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.790
they share a similar number of heartbeats over the course of their lives.

108
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.540
Their speed of life is the opposite and somehow still the same and for a video

109
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.030
in which we made elephants explode for no good reason,

110
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.210
this is the most romantic ending we could come up with.

111
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.630
Speaking of romance and love,

112
00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:00.290
one of the questions we get asked most often is how we make animated videos.

113
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.950
The short answer is with Adobe after effects and years of training,

114
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.670
but rather than just points you to our favorite online tutorial service,

115
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.470
we decided to make a skill Schatz tutorial expanding how we made a scene from

116
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.800
one of our videos.
If you aren't already familiar with this,

117
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.670
skillshare is an online learning community with more than 18,000 classes and

professionals working in their fields so you can improve your skills,

121
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.530
unlock new opportunities,
and did work that you'd really enjoy.

122
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.810
It's also extremely affordable.
The annual subscription is less than $10 a month,

123
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.120
but because we appreciate you,

124
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.390
we've arranged for the first 1000 people to get their first two months

125
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.440
absolutely free.
If you want to learn how we animate our stuff,

126
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.660
this is the way to go,
okay.

127
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.370
This concludes cords cause aren't for 12,017 happy holidays.

128
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:55.880
Everybody.
