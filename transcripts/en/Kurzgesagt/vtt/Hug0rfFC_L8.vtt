00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.670
The Internet is like a breeding ground for conspiracy theories.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.100
While some are just stupid and funny,

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.190
others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.050
So we went to the codes because out Glam and developed a foolproof system to

5
00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:18.790
destroy.
Not all,
but a lot of conspiracy theories.
It's really simple.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.470
Just ask yourself,
does the theory affects really rich and powerful people?

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.300
Is the answer?
Yes.
Okay,
then it's most likely not true.

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.670
Let's test it on three examples.

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.530
Number one,
there's an easy cure for cancer,

10
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.530
but it's with help because it would destroy the profits of Pharma companies.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.840
Do really rich people die of cancer like my to know,

12
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:51.320
say the former CEO of apple.
Yes,

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.210
there is no suppressed cure for cancer.
Number two,

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.000
chem trails.
The theory that airplanes,

15
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.020
it sprayed chemicals in the air for population control or some other crazy

16
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.660
reason don't really powerful.
People breathe air.

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.650
Do Obama or Putin breathe air?
Yes.

18
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.370
Chem trails are not a thing.
Number three,

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.650
apocalyptic conspiracy theories.

20
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.420
The world will end soon because of the antichrist.
Meyers aliens.

21
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.321
Someone says,

22
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:25.850
so do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon to be upon us and very

23
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.360
eminent apocalypse.
Yes,
the world will not.
And soon,

24
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.070
this obviously doesn't work for every conspiracy theory out there,

25
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.320
but it does work for some of the most stupid ones.

26
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.160
So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati but stuff in

27
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:40.880
your water,

28
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.450
just show them this video and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends

29
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.170
on Facebook.
