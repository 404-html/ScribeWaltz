1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.960
Human history is told by the energy we use,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.550
and first we had to use our muscles.
Then we learned to control fire.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.890
We industrialize the world using colon oil and entered the atomic age.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
When we learned how to split a nucleus at each step,

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.970
we increased our energy harvest to a scale,
never seen before,

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.120
and advanced as a species.
Currently,

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.780
we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky,

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.900
fusion energy will become viable in the future as humanity progresses further,

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.030
if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
we will locally gain complete control of our planet's resources.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.400
At that stage,

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into,

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.760
but space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.840
will require ungodly amounts of energy.
Luckily,

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.580
we know where to find it.
The Sun,
the ultimate source of energy,

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.890
a furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear

17
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.724
reactor.

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
So how do we get this energy,
not some of us,
all of it.

20
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.930
If we want to collect the most energy physically possible,

21
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.800
we'll have to build the largest,
most ambitious structure in the universe.

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.210
The Dysons sphere,

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.160
a mega structure that encompasses our whole staff to capture its power output

24
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.320
for an intelligent species.

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
Building a Dyson sphere is a technological leap on a pile with the discovery of

26
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:46.110
fire for our ancestors,

27
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.610
the transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species,

28
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.060
it would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely

29
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.860
imagine.
So what would it look like?

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.180
A solid shell enveloping the sun is probably not the way to go.

31
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.070
A large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts,
possibly shattering.

32
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.670
It would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the sun.

33
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.640
A more viable design for a Dyson sphere might be a Dyson swarm and enormous set

34
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:21.450
of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere,

35
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.860
such as world would give humanity basically unlimited energy.

36
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.660
You've got building,
it won't be easy on the sun is very big,

37
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.070
so we need a lot of satellites.
If each satellite is a square kilometer,

38
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.430
we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the summer,

39
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.250
even if they are built as lightly as possible.

40
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.340
We need about 100 quintillion tons of material and then we need the energy to

41
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.850
actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the

42
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.950
sun.
On top of all that,

43
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.000
we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building.

44
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.140
Let's assume for the of this video that our descendants will take care of that

45
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.150
and want to create the mega structure.

46
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.800
We can sort the challenges into three main categories,
materials,

47
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
design that and energy to get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our

48
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.381
Dyson's swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planet of the planet's

49
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.760
available.
Mercury is the best candidate.

50
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
It's the closest to the sun and very metal rich close to the sun also means less

51
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:33.091
moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the

52
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:37.570
surface gravity of earth making it comparatively easy to launch material into

53
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.620
space.
Next,
we should consider the design of our swarm.

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.240
Simpler is better.

55
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives.

56
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.220
Our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for

57
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.790
astronomically long times,
and they need to be cheap to produce.

58
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.210
They're most likely going to be enormous mirrors,

59
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.680
which we focus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated

60
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.280
solar power on earth to build and launch them efficiently.

61
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
They must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal foil,

62
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.090
bound to some supports and lost.

63
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.390
We need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself.

64
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.920
Taking apart a planet and launching things into space requires an enormous

65
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.720
amount of energy.
For example,

66
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.010
if we used all the fossil fuels and uranium on earth and we were perfectly

67
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:27.760
efficient,

68
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760
we could only launch as much mass as Mount Everest into space or rather meager

69
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.650
accomplishment compared to penetrate disassembly.

70
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.770
To get the energy needed to build a Dyson sphere,

71
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.220
it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a Dyson sphere,

72
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.510
but that's okay.
There's plenty of sunlight to be had on mercury,

73
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.950
so let's get to work.

74
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.570
Humans are expensive to keep alive and a very sensitive to the environment.

75
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.650
So we'd want to automate as much as possible.
Ideally,

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.910
we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines

77
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.260
doing the actual work.
There are four major pieces of technology,

78
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.220
requires solar collectors,
minors,
refiners,

79
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.660
and launch equipment.

80
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.490
The solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the

81
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:17.200
planet to start,

82
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.130
maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them pie there as mirrors

83
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.480
or as traditional solar panels.
They'll provide the energy to run our minors,

84
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.930
which strip mined the surface of the Panisse and our refiners,

85
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.080
which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites to

86
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:37.810
get them into space.
We need a creative and efficient solution.

87
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.220
Rockets are too expensive and difficult to deal Beta and reuse.

88
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.570
Instead,

89
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.650
we'll want to use a sort of rail Guernica along that electromagnetic track,

90
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.200
which launches our satellites at high speeds.

91
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.610
Our swarms satellites would be packed tight for launch unfurling like an

92
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:58.040
enormous origami once in always.
From this point,

93
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.240
we can take advantage of exponential growth using the energy of the existing

94
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:06.170
parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on mercury and launched new

95
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:10.700
panels and faster and faster.
Each panel provides the energy to build another.

96
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.960
Those two work together to build the next two four become eight,

97
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.150
eight become 16 and so on.
Within just about 60 doubling times,

98
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.350
the sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels and this can happen

99
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.130
quickly if a square kilometer of so to collectors takes a month to build.

100
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.150
We could be done in a decade if only our infrastructure on the planet's surface

101
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.490
can keep up with a quickly growing budget of energy.

102
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Even collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species

103
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.600
energy budget.

104
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.830
We could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of

105
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.130
energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects,

106
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.460
colonies on other worlds,
terraforming planets,

107
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.930
constructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars.

108
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.410
It could be the start of an interstellar civilizations based on physics alone.

109
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.660
This is not just possible but easy.

110
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.940
It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand

111
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:12.020
beyond our home planet.

112
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.950
That many astronomers that think there are probably Dyson's fairs already out

113
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.210
there in the Milky Way.
We haven't spotted any yet,
but they could be there.

114
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.500
It's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point.

115
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.390
Our attention is too often focused on short term political gains and conflicts.

116
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.100
That will not matter in the long run,

117
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.460
but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves,

118
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.390
we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a

119
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.250
structure with the scope of a star.

120
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.030
If we do it the only limitation left,
we'll be our own imagination.

121
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.260
We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts.

122
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.150
If you're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways

123
00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:58.984
to destroy stuff,

124
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.500
you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself.

125
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.000
Brilliant is a problem solving website that helps you learn stuff through fun

126
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:11.410
puzzles that spit up a complex problem into bite size chunks and build up to an

127
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:12.400
interesting conclusion.

128
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.130
It helps you understand how science works by actually using it instead of just

129
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.450
memorizing a bunch of stuff.

130
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.770
Brilliance has tons of interesting courses and puzzles on things like quantum

131
00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:27.490
computing,
astronomy and logic,
and even Dyson's fares.

132
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.590
If you visit brilliant.org/nutshell or click the link in the description,

133
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.710
you can sign up for free and learn all kinds of things.

134
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.450
As a bonus for quilts cause out viewers,

135
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.730
the first 688 people will also get 20% off that annual membership.

136
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.380
With brilliance.

137
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.270
You can finish each day a little bit smarter and just maybe you can help to

138
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:52.270
expand the human species into the universe one day.

139
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.550
We love Dyson's spheres so much,
but we've also made a poster about them.

140
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.650
It will look pretty on your wall,

141
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.590
but also has some information about the concept of a Dyson sphere.

142
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.140
A great way to start a conversation or you can just stare at it and dream about

143
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.240
the future.
Go get it here.
