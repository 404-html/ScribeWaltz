00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.510
Rogue planets are planets,
the travel through the universe alone.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
They inhabit the dark and fast space between the stars drifting alone through

3
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.070
eternal darkness.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
No light warms their surfaces and they're exposed to the freezing cold of outer

5
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.350
space.
They know no seasons,
no days,
and no nights,

6
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:27.030
which could give away the passing of time and yet rope candidates might carry

7
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.550
alien life to all corners of the galaxy.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.960
How would that work and how does a planet become a rogue anyway?

9
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.203
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.980
<v 0>there are several very different things that get called rogue planet.</v>

11
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.011
For example,

12
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:53.690
sub brown dwarfs gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and are the

13
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:58.520
boring little brothers of brown dwarfs there a sort of failed star and will now

14
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:02.630
stop talking about them.
A far more interesting sort of rogue.

15
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.800
Our terrestrial planets similar to earth that got kicked out of their planetary

16
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:07.634
system.

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.500
Young star systems aren't dangerous places where Protel planets are battling for

18
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:17.300
the available mass guzzling up as much material as possible in this fight for

19
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:17.900
dominance.

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.410
They collide with each other or get dangerously close to each other's orbits.

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.280
If a very massive planet moves,
it's all big closer to the star.

22
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.310
It can kick smaller planets out of the system,
but just because of pen,

23
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.050
it has survived.
The growing pains of formation doesn't mean it's safe.

24
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.450
Planetary systems can be disrupted by fly buys from stars or black holes at any

25
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:42.860
point.
Up to half of all planets board could end up as rogues.

26
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.110
The scientists don't agree on the numbers,

27
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.060
but it's likely that at the very least,

28
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.500
there are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone.
Most rogues,

29
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:56.060
we'll share the same depressing fate as their star becomes a smaller day.
By Day,

30
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.980
the planet's surface quickly cools down to minus 270 degrees Celsius.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.330
If they have oceans,
they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock.

32
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.620
Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface and eventually freeze too.

33
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.350
But weirdly enough,
some of these frozen dark deserts could harbor life

34
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.890
to understand how,

35
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.790
let's imagine a planet similar to Earth in the same order of magnitude in terms

36
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:26.870
of mass and composition.
If we put it into deep space,

37
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.580
how good it still support life.

38
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.210
As far as we understand the nature of life.

39
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.350
There is one indispensable ingredient.
It needs liquid water.

40
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.930
Water is important because it mixes things both matter and energy,

41
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.110
which lets interesting chemistry happen like life.

42
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm

43
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.740
enough to sustain liquid water.

44
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.380
Annoyingly about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the sun.

45
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.980
So our imaginary Rogan needs to work with the 0.03% of energy it has left,

46
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.910
which almost exclusively comes from it's hot center.

47
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.980
Earths in a core is a giant metal ball about as hot as the surface of the sun

48
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.700
that surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very,

49
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.420
very slowly solidifying,
releasing a lot of heat in the process.

50
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.970
As long as this process is ongoing,

51
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.200
our planet will be geologically active with solid and liquid material moving

52
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:30.040
around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed as

53
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:34.720
geothermal energy while the hot core of every penny.
It will cool off.
Eventually.

54
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.090
This process takes billions of years,

55
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.210
enough time for life to come into existence and thrive.

56
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.310
There's even one scenario that could allow an earthlink panic to have oceans

57
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.510
that are not frozen over.

58
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.160
If the planet had an extremely dense and high pressure hydrogen atmosphere,

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.880
the gas would not freeze and could travel enough of the heat trying to escape

60
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:58.450
the panties to enable oceans that extend all the way to the surface.

61
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.460
And there's another possible way to stay warm moods.
If a rope can,

62
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.880
it brings a moon or more along with them or large enough moon could inject

63
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.820
additional energy into the system via tidal forces.

64
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.320
These forces stretch and squeeze the panicked a little bit every day like

65
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.120
kneading dough,
keeping it warm.

66
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.880
But the most likely scenario for a rogue bearing life is one with sub place.

67
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:24.370
She'll oceans under a kilometer thick layer of mostly water ice.

68
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.770
These are not completely absurd since we already have a few of them in the soda

69
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:29.604
system.

70
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.830
So how could life sustain itself at the bottom of a completely dark cold ocean

71
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.590
on earth?
Deep down in our oceans in complete darkness,

72
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.000
in volcanically active areas that are hydrothermal vents called black smokers.

73
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.660
They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water,

74
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
providing a constant flow of minerals from Earth's mantle bacteria feed on the

75
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:56.560
minerals and produce organic materials,
which attracts crustaceans by valves,

76
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.330
snails,
fish,
octopus and tube worms up to two meters long.

77
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
Not only our hydrothermal vents home to an incredibly diverse group of living

78
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.310
beings,

79
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.960
but also a contender for the place where life could have begun on earth billions

80
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.810
of years ago in the dark ocean of a rogue planet.

81
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.130
Similar vents or volcanic activity could be the starting point and basis for

82
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:19.480
complex ecosystems.

83
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.570
We can only imagine right now one upside and ecosystem in a row pan it ocean has

84
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.870
is that the environment is extremely stable.
The thick ice,

85
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:32.620
she protects it from all sorts of extinction events and as long as the energy

86
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.980
from the core keeps on coming,
things stay pretty much the same.

87
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.080
The most likely forms of life are bacteria and other microorganisms,

88
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.550
but given enough time,

89
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.540
more complex alien animals could feed on the smaller beings and thrive.

90
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.130
It's not impossible that intelligent life could emerge in such an environment.

91
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.330
If it did,
it would find itself in a pretty weird world,

92
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.190
constricted by an wall of rock,

93
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.720
hard ice at the top and bedrock at the bottom without any plants to store star

94
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.250
energy.
There would be no wood oil or coal.
Even if there were,

95
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.900
it's not like you discover fire at the bottom of an ocean.
Without this energy.

96
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.370
Metals may never be forged into useful.
Things are intelligent.

97
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.650
Alien friends might never break through the ice.

98
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.660
They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside and assumed that

99
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.640
their small world is all there is.

100
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.690
Millions of generations might live and die in these dark oceans.

101
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.960
Ignorant of the unbelievably big universe of Buffy ice until the core of that

102
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:40.391
planet calls off and all life finishes as the oceans completely freeze the

103
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.740
remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped in an icy grave forever.

104
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.150
If you think about it,
it might be better not to be aware of all that,

105
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.870
but the concept is disturbing and exciting.

106
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.610
The universe might be teeming with life trapped on pallets that are basically

107
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.840
impossible to leave.

108
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.100
Worlds like this could frequently pass the soda system without us even knowing

109
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.980
maybe one day in the far future humans will set foot on one of these frozen

110
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.470
worlds and try to say hello.

111
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.730
Okay,
so we love gluey future scenarios but let's go back to the present for a

112
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.390
different kind of surprise.
Many of you want to know how we make our videos.

113
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.060
So we made a video about that cause cause zones teamed up with skill share,

114
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.180
a favorite online learning community for creators to make a three part series of
