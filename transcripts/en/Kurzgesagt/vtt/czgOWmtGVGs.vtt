00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.410
Humans have existed for millions of years as part of nature,

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.860
but then something changed and in an incredibly short amount of time we tear

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.960
formed.
There's Panisse and designed it to fit our needs.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.690
As far as we know,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.710
we're the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.030
The transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building was so

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.200
breathtaking me fast that many of our ways of thinking about the world are no

8
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.034
longer useful.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.840
One of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used Canada in the

10
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:38.841
world insists that we live in the year 2016 this distorts our view of our own

11
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:44.550
history and makes it harder to understand who we are as a species and just how

12
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.430
far we've come in an incredibly short amount of time.

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
So maybe it's time to choose a year zero for humanity a year zero that truly

14
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.890
represents us as a species and includes all cultures a year zero.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.150
The marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one

16
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.750
12,000 years ago,

17
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.230
hundreds of humans came together in the hills of southern Anatolia.

18
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.940
They were hunters and gatherers without knowledge of agriculture or
metalworking.

19
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.970
All they had were tools made of stone and wood,

20
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.360
but they built humanity's first big construction project 7,000 years before the

21
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.630
pyramids were built in Egypt,
spread over 300 meters.

22
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.020
Our ancestors erected circles of massive stone pillars,

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.260
each of them up to six meters high and 40 tons in weight decorated with artful

24
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.080
pictograms and stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.530
We have no idea how they were able to do this.

26
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750
It was probably a project of epic scale for the Stone Age requiring a novel of

27
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:04.170
Organization we didn't know early humans were capable of until we found their

28
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.040
site.
So why did they build it?

29
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.060
The most popular theory is that this was the first temple of humanity dedicated

30
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:18.200
to non forgotten gods.
We only know that this construction project,

31
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.320
the first of its kind marks the beginning of a new era.

32
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.310
It's in this area around that time that humans truly began to build their own

33
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:28.184
world,

34
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.600
which would make it a fitting milestone in our history for the start of our

35
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.434
Canada.

36
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.490
This moment in time is so distinct that scientist Chaz Emanyani proposed that

37
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.920
humanity should switch to what he called the Holocene Canada.

38
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.700
By adding 10,000 years to our current Gregorian Canada,

39
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.570
we don't need to change our wet established days.

40
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.360
A month and religious calendars could stay the same as well,

41
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.850
but for all official purposes,

42
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.430
our current year will be the year 12,016 of the human error.

43
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
This would drastically alter how we think about history and how it feels.

44
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Let's take a very brief look and move through our new history from our new year.

45
00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:13.004
Zero

46
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.680
12,000 years ago saw the beginning of the first construction project kicking off

47
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:24.160
our history.
It would be a use for about 2000 years.

48
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.460
It took nearly a millennium until Jericho,

49
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.050
probably the first city on earth was founded in the year 1000 after the start of

50
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:36.430
the human error,
progress was still very,
very slow.
At this point.

51
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.590
Over the next thousand years,

52
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.670
more and more permanent settlements appeared around the world and more and more

53
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.671
plants and animals were domesticated as agriculture spread evidence for trade

54
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:53.011
over thousands of kilometers has been found from this period around 5 million

55
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:57.280
humans were alive at this point in history.
Fewer than live in London today.

56
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.100
Technology advanced constantly at a slow pace.
Pottery became widespread.

57
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.610
The first cultural communities appeared in China,
India,

58
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.880
and the Fertile Crescent around the year four thousand eight thousand years ago.

59
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.820
From today,

60
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.990
humans started to use metal for the first time and learning to mix 10 and cover

61
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.630
and the kickstarting what we know as the bronze age.

62
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:24.631
Around the year 5,000 the first Proto writing merged and the wheel was invented

63
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.670
in South America.

64
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.170
The Chin Choteau culture started to artificially mummify humans 2000 years

65
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.610
earlier that in ancient Egypt,

66
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.610
the first high cultures began emerging around the year 7,000 the Indus Valley

67
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.220
civilization ancient Egypt,

68
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.260
the Minoans in Greece and the Sumerians in Mesopotamia.

69
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.280
Stonehenge was built in Britain and the first dynasty in China began at see the

70
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.630
iceman lift.
Around this time,

71
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.210
what we consider history now started and things began picking up pace as the

72
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:03.460
world population rose to over 30 million.

73
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.690
A number of new high cultures appeared around the world.

74
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.320
Many writing down the legends born more cities were founded in South America.

75
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.740
The Omak culture emerged around this time.

76
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.030
The legendary siege of Troy is supposed to have happened soon after in the

77
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.030
eastern Mediterranean and the Fertile Crescent,
the Bronze Age,

78
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:30.031
and in violence every bronze age culture except Egypt was destroyed by

79
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.780
mysterious invaders.

80
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.080
Writing and progressive froze for hundreds of years around the year 9,500 what

81
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:39.880
we consider western culture began.

82
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.800
The Greek city states beat off the Persian invasion and triggered that golden

83
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:49.801
era and it by Alexander the great around (900) 070-0100 years later wrote and

84
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.660
destroyed Carthage and became a dominant force in the wild.

85
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.810
Caesar was murdered in the year 9,956 while the world population had risen to

86
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.130
about 300 million people.

87
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.610
And it's only now around the year 10,000 that we've reached the point where the

88
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.660
Gregorian Canada and our current method of marking human history begins.

89
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.760
Amir,
2000 years from now,
humans will walk on the moon.

90
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.060
If we think about history as we do now,

91
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.800
we are underplaying 10,000 years of human progress and development,

92
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.780
including all of it,
and our Canada makes our past more impressive.

93
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.090
It shows how progress became exponential with time and it incorporates all

94
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.520
humans from all cultures into our Canada.

95
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.280
A New Year zero for our history could reframe how we think of ourselves

96
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.610
as a building project that started 12,000 years ago when for the first time our

97
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:56.570
ancestors came together to carve a temple out of bedrock with tools made of

98
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.780
stone,
not knowing what they would set in motion,

99
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.090
where it would lead us as a species from building the first temple,

100
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.940
two ships flying beyond the sky.

101
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.420
We've made a coat's cause our diversion of the human error Canada that you can

102
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:15.380
buy hair if you want.

103
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.700
It's a Canada for 2017 but with one important difference.

104
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.410
It's for the year 12,017 the year we think we should be in.

105
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:29.120
Right now,
there are only a very limited amount available,
but if we sell,

106
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.630
enough of them will make this a regular thing and maybe produce more print

107
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:33.620
products in the future.

108
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.900
The calendar is illustrated and we put in a few fun facts.
Also,
as always,

109
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.280
if you like what we do,

110
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.940
please consider supporting us on Patrion vol buying things we made.

111
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.170
It really helps.

112
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.460
Thanks and have a happy 12,017.
