1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.720
The international banking system is an enigma.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.940
There are more than 30,000 different banks worldwide and the hold unbelievable

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.990
amounts of assets.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.260
The top 10 banks alone account for roughly 25 trillion us daughters today.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.060
Banking can seem very complex,
but originally the idea was to make life simpler.

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.070
11th Century,

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.500
Italy was the center of European trading merchants from all over the continent,

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.300
Matt,
to trade their goods,
but there was one problem,

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.080
too many currencies in circulation in Piza.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.700
Merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins and had to exchange

11
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.670
their money constantly.
This exchange business,

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
which commonly to place outdoors on benches is where we get the word bank from,

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.270
from the word bankable battalion for badge.
The dangers of traveling,

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.250
counterfeit money and the difficulty of getting alone got people thinking it was

15
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.840
time for a new business model.

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.370
Pawnbrokers started to give credit to businessmen while Genovese merchants

17
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.870
developed cashless payments.

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
Networks of banks spread all over Europe handing out credit even to the church.

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.260
Oh,
European kings.
What about today?
In a nutshell,

20
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.660
banks are in the risk management business.

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.960
This is a simplified version of the way it works.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.280
People keep their money in banks and receive a small amount of interest.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.840
The bank takes this money and lends it out at much higher interest rates.

24
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.920
It's a calculated risk because some of the vendors,

25
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:38.610
it will default on their credit.

26
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.290
This process is essential for our economic system because it provides resources

27
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:48.090
for people to buy things like houses or for industry to expand their businesses

28
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.983
and grow.

29
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.120
So banks take funds that are unused by savers and turned them into funds society

30
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:58.650
can use to do stuff.
Other sources of income for banks include accepting,

31
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.490
saving deposits,
the credit card business and buying and selling currencies,

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.790
custodian business and cash management services.

33
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.620
The main problem with banks nowadays is that a lot of them have abandoned their

34
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:14.970
traditional role as providers of longterm financial products in favor of short

35
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:19.170
term gains that carry much higher risks during the financial boom.

36
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.000
Most major banks adopted financial constraints that were badly comprehensible

37
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.470
and did their own trading in a bit to make fast money and earn their executives

38
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.480
and traders millions in bonuses.

39
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.220
This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies

40
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.230
linked back in 2008 when banks life Lehman Brothers gave credit to basically

41
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.280
anyone who wanted to buy a house and thereby put the bank in an extremely

42
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.510
dangerous risk position.

43
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.440
This led to the collapse of the housing market in the U S and parts of Europe

44
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.330
causing stock prices to plummet,

45
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.530
which eventually led to a global bank and crisis and one of the largest

46
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:57.300
financial crises in history.

47
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.030
Hundreds of billions of just evaporated.

48
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.810
Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money.

49
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.580
Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines and bankers became

50
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.500
some of the least trusted professionals.

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.520
The U s government and the European Union had to put together a huge bailout

52
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:19.570
packages to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt.

53
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.050
New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business.

54
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.610
Compulsory Bank emergency funds when forced to absorb shocks in the event of

55
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:31.630
another financial crisis,
but other pieces of tough new legislation,

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.960
we're successfully blocked by the banking lobby today.

57
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.410
Other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast,

58
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.270
like new investment banks that charge a yearly fee and do not get commissions on

59
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:43.990
sales,

60
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.790
thus providing the motivation to act in the best interests of their clients or

61
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.630
credit unions.

62
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.710
Corporative initiatives that were established in the 19th century to circumvent

63
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.510
credit sharks.
In a nutshell,

64
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.460
they provide the same financial services as banks put focus on shared value

65
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.410
rather than profit maximization.

66
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.360
The self proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities length starting

67
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.290
small businesses,

68
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.480
expanding farms or building family homes while investing back into communities.

69
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.980
They are controlled by their members who also elect the board of directors.

70
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:18.814
Democratically.

71
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.590
Worldwide Credit Union systems vary significantly ranging from a handful of

72
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.390
members to organization's worth several billion US dollars and hundreds of

73
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.223
thousands of members.

74
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.340
The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are

75
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:37.420
willing to take,
which explains why credit unions,
although also hurting,

76
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.650
survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks.

77
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.610
Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years.

78
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.150
Aside from making awesome video games,

79
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.180
possible platforms of rose that enabled people to get loans from large groups of

80
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.150
small investors circumventing the bank as a middleman,

81
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.040
but it also works for industry.

82
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.330
Lots of new technology companies started out on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

83
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.710
The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing and

84
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:06.760
can invest in ideas.

85
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:10.900
They believe it while spreading the risk so widely that if the project fails,

86
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.810
the damage is limited.
And last but not least,

87
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.540
microcredit lots of very small loans,

88
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.140
mostly handed out in developing countries that help people escape poverty.

89
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.950
People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to

90
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.120
start a business because they weren't deemed worth the taimen.
Nowadays,

91
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.110
the granting of micro credits has evolved into a multibillion dollar business.

92
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.750
So banking might not be up your straight,

93
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.520
but the bank's role of providing funds to people and businesses is crucial for

94
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:41.200
our society and has to be done.

95
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.640
Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to design

96
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:45.880
though.
