00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.670
What is the stock exchange and how does it work?

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
The stock exchange is nothing more than a giant globally network tend to

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.870
organized marketplace where every day huge sums of money are moved back and

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.310
forth in total over 60 trillion euros a year.

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:22.311
A traded more than the value of all goods and services of the entire world

6
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.200
economy.
However,

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
it's not apples or secondhand toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace,

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.740
but predominantly securities securities.
Our Rights to assets,

9
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:39.210
mostly in the form of shacks.
A Shas stands for a share in a company,

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.730
but why are shy has traded at all?
Well,
first and foremost,

11
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.340
the value of a share relates to the company behind it.

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.670
If you think of the value of the company in terms of a pizza,

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.830
the bigger the overall size of the leads at the bigger every piece is if for

14
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.590
example,
Facebook is able to Greg,

15
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:01.250
the increase its profits with a new business model,
the size of the company,

16
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:05.460
it's pizza will also increase and as a result,
so will the value of its shares.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.160
This is of course great for the shareholders.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 year olds could now be worth a whole

19
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.050
50 euros
when it's sold.

20
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
This represents a profit of 12 euros per share,
but what does Facebook came from?

21
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:25.620
This,
the company can raise funds by selling the shares and invest or expand its

22
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.500
business.
Facebook,
for example,

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.040
has earned $16 billion from its listing on the stock exchange.

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
The trading of shares though is frequently a game of chance.

25
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.000
No one can say which company will perform well and which will not.

26
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.020
If a company has a good reputation,
investors will back it.

27
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.130
A company with a poor reputation or poor performance will have difficulty

28
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.090
selling his shares.

29
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.120
Unlike a normal market in which goods can be touched and taken home on the stock

30
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.370
exchange,
only virtual goods are available.

31
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.500
They appear in the form of share prices and tables on monitors.

32
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.800
Such share prices can rise or fall within seconds.

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.180
Shareholders therefore have to act quickly in order not to miss an opportunity.

34
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320
Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for a share falling fast.

35
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.390
Regardless of the real value of the company.
Of course,

36
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.710
the opposite is also possible if a particularly large number of people by week

37
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.890
shares because they see,
for example,
great potential behind an idea,

38
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040
their value will rise as a result in particular,

39
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.480
young companies can benefit from this.
Even though their sales might be falling,

40
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.150
they can generate cash by placing their shares.

41
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.240
In the best case scenario.

42
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:41.850
This would result in their idea being turned into reality.

43
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.800
In the worst case scenario,

44
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.340
this will result in a speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air,

45
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.420
and as in the case with bubbles,
at some point they will burst.

46
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.860
The value of Germany's biggest 30 companies is summarized in what's known as the

47
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:56.910
Dax Sharon decks.

48
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.350
The decks curve shows how well or poorly these major companies,

49
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.190
and thereby the economy as a whole are performing at the present time.

50
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.590
Stock exchanges and other countries also have their own indices and all of these

51
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:16.370
markets together create a globally networked marketplace.
