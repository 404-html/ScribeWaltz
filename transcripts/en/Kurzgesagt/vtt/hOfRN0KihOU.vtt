00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.720
Mechanisms of evolution.
What is evolution?

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.650
Evolution is the development of life on earth.

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.680
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to

4
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:19.514
this day.

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.440
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to

6
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.274
develop.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.450
It shows us how primitive protozoa could become the millions of different

8
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:30.920
species that we see today.

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.090
Evolution then is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a

10
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:40.910
Dachsund and a great Dane together.

11
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.990
How it possible for ancestors to have to sentence that look so very different to

12
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.440
them
and answering this question,

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.820
we want to focus on animals excluding other forms of life such as Funghi

14
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.230
implants.
The first question to ask cause therefore,

15
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.930
how can one animal developed into a whole new species of animal?

16
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.820
But just a quick question.
What exactly [inaudible] is a species.

17
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.350
A species is a community of anime.

18
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.190
What was that is capable of producing offspring with one another with those

19
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.770
offspring also being capable of reproducing.

20
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:23.650
In turn to understand this answer better,

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.110
we need to take a closer look at the following points.

22
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.840
The uniqueness of living creatures guaranteed through the excess production of

23
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:36.340
offspring and heredity.
And as a second key point selection,

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.430
let's begin with uniqueness.

25
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.420
Every creature that exists as unique and this is essential for evolution,

26
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.560
the members of a species may strongly resemble each other in appearance.
However,

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.440
they all have slightly different traits and characteristics.

28
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.920
They may be a bit bigger,
fatter,
stronger,
or bolder than their fellow animals.

29
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.700
So what is the reason for these differences?

30
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.400
Let's take a closer look at a creature.

31
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.280
Every creature is made up of cells.
The cells have a nucleus,

32
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.280
the nucleus contains the chromosomes,
and the chromosomes hold.

33
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:20.150
The DNA.

34
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.440
DNA consists of different genes and it's these genes that are life's information

35
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.073
carriers.

36
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.540
They contain instructions and orders for the cells and determine the

37
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.090
characteristics and traits that living creatures have.

38
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.593
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.260
<v 0>and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature.</v>

40
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940
It's slightly different from individual to individual,

41
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.450
which is why each has slightly different characteristics.

42
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.350
But how is the enormous range of DNA create it?

43
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.670
<v 0>One key factor is the excess production of offspring in nature.</v>

45
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.060
We can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring than is

46
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.230
necessary for the survival of their species with many offspring dying an early

47
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.220
death.
As a result,

48
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.850
often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they live is

49
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.350
able to support.
This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species.

50
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.000
The more offspring that are produced,
the mall,
little differences occur,

51
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.670
and this is what nature wants as many little differences as possible.

52
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.910
The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity

53
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.070
itself.
By the way,

54
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.400
heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring

55
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.770
to very interesting factors come into play in this process.

56
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.100
Recombination and mutation

57
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.590
recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures.

58
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.590
When two creatures fall in love and mate,
they recombine their jeans twice

59
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.890
the first time.
They do this separately.

60
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.700
When they generate the gamuts that his sperm and egg cells,

61
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.470
the gamuts take half of the genes and shuffled them.

62
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.230
The secondary combination occurs when email in seven eight so female.

63
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.080
The parents each provide 50% of their DNA.
In other words,

64
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.050
50% of their unique traits and characteristics.

65
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.660
These are then recombined or mixed and the result is new offspring.

66
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.480
These offspring have a random mix of the DNA and therefore the traits and

67
00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:40.190
characteristics of their parents.

68
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.770
This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further,

69
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.410
but two mutations are also important for evolution.

70
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.980
Mutations are random changes in DNA.

71
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.240
These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA triggered by toxins

72
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:04.280
or other chemical substances all by radiation.

73
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.380
A mutation exists when a part of the DNA is altered.

74
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.020
These changes are often negative and may result in illnesses such as cancer.

75
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.451
However,

76
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:21.690
they may also have a neutral or positive effects such as the blue eye color in

77
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.440
humans,
which is one such random mutation.

78
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.500
In all cases,

79
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.680
a mutation has to affect a gamut that is a spur more XL because only the DNA in

80
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.170
the gamuts is passed onto the offspring.

81
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.720
This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays,

82
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.420
whilst other parts of the body are not at risk.

83
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.110
In summary then in the heredity process,

84
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.070
creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA

85
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.330
recombination and mutation change the DNA,

86
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.790
so each child looks different too.

87
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:03.620
It's siblings and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents.

88
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.760
There's a key word here,
random.

89
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.940
All of these processes are based on chance,

90
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.340
random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of

91
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:22.840
traits and characteristics,
which in turn mixed these randomly and pass them on.

92
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.160
But how can so much be down to chance when all living creatures are so perfectly

93
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:34.240
adapted to their environment.
For example,
the stick insect,

94
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.850
the Hummingbird,
and the frog fish,

95
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.470
the answer is provided by the second key point selection.

96
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.060
Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection.

97
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.163
As we have learned,

98
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.120
each individual is somewhat different to its fellows and there is extensive

99
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:57.710
variation within a species.

100
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.400
Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures.

101
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.780
The so called selection factors include predators,

102
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.090
parasites,
animals of the same species,
toxins,
changes in habitat.

103
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.460
All the climate selection is a process that each individual is subjected to.

104
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.900
Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics.

105
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.420
This makes,
helps them to survive in their environment or not.

106
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.370
As the case may be,

107
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.020
anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment.

108
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.340
Those were the right mix.

109
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:44.030
Survive and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics.

110
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.920
<v 0>This is why diversity is so important.</v>

112
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.090
This is why creatures make so much effort to produce offspring that are as

113
00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:55.140
different as possible.

114
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.920
They increase the likelihood that at least one of their offspring passes nature

115
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.170
selection process.
They maximize their chances of survival.

116
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.930
A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote

117
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:10.764
island.

118
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.450
They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science and are known

119
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:18.780
as Darwin finches after that discover Charles Darwin,

120
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.210
and this is the story of those finches.
A few hundred years ago,

121
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.380
a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos islands in the middle of

122
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.910
the Pacific,
probably by a big storm,

123
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.250
the finch finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to

124
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:41.200
them,
a real finch paradise and abundance of food and no predators.

125
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.160
They reproduced rapidly and numerously.

126
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.710
The islands were soon heaving with finches.

127
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.650
This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce.

128
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.820
The finch paradise was threatened with famine and finch friends became,

129
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.470
this is when selection intervened.
Their individuality and small differences.

130
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.030
In this case,
they're slightly different.
Beaks med,

131
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.530
the some of the birds were able to avoid competing with their fellow finches.

132
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.730
The beaks of some of the finches were more suitable for digging for worms.

133
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.030
Other finches,
we're able to use their beaks better for cracking seat.

134
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.180
<v 4>Okay.</v>

135
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.530
<v 0>The finches consequently salt out ecological niches and these niches,</v>

136
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.450
they were safe from excessive competition.

137
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.010
They sit and began to meet primarily with other finches that use the same niche

138
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.310
over the course of many generations.

139
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.810
These characteristics were enhanced enabling the finches to exploit their Nisha

140
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.644
successfully.

141
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.810
The differences between the worm diggers and the seed crackers became so large

142
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.180
that they were no longer able to meet with one another.

143
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.030
Different species emerged as a result.

144
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.910
Today there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos islands,

145
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.390
all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches.

146
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.030
This is how new species are created by evolution through the interaction of

147
00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:10.360
unique individuals,
the excess production of offspring,

148
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.110
recombination and mutation in heredity,

149
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.840
and finally through selection.

150
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.170
Why is this so important?

151
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.520
It tells us whether the variety of life comes from and wine living creatures are

152
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:29.500
so perfectly adapted to that habitat,
but it also affects us personally.

153
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.680
Every person is the result of three and a half billion years of evolution and

154
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:40.210
that includes you.
Your ancestors fought and adapted in order to survive.

155
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.140
This survival was an extremely uncertain thing.

156
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.540
If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are

157
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.870
extinct,
then you can consider yourself part of a success story.

158
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.920
The dinosaurs have disappeared,

159
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.220
but you are alive watching this video because you're incredibly special.

160
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.440
Just like all the other creatures that exist today,

161
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.400
irreproducible and unique in the universe.
