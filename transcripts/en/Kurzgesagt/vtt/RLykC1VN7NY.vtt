00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.980
Imagine if you could gather the energy for every style within 100 million light

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.270
years from thousands of galaxies,
each with billions of stars,

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.250
and imagine you could take this kind of power and use it to find the biggest

4
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.970
super weapon in the universe.
Imagine the damage you could do.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.510
It turns out you don't need to imagine it.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
These exist and they're called gamma ray bursts,

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.190
but what are these cosmic snipers and what happens if one takes a shot at earth

8
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.100
to understand gamma ray bursts?
We first have to understand gamma rays.

9
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.180
Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation waves,

10
00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.550
which carry energy just like visible night.

11
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.540
Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

12
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.700
It's the part your eyes can see at lower energies.
There are radio waves,

13
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.300
microwaves,
and infrared,
and at higher energies,

14
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.390
ultraviolet x rays and gamma rays.

15
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.150
Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.

16
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.550
A single gamma ray photon is more energetic than a million of visible photons

17
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:18.370
combined.
They're high energy,

18
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.100
makes gum arrays a form of ionizing radiation,

19
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.690
meaning they are energetic enough to break apart atomic bonds.

20
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.050
This makes them dangerous to you and me.

21
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.430
Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us

22
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:38.170
alive like a nine millimeter bullet through o'clock.
Fortunately on earth,

23
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.830
the ozone layer blocks gamma rays filtering them out before they can harm us,

24
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.950
but if the atmosphere blocks gum raise from space,

25
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.370
how were gallery bursts or grps from space ever discovered during the Cold War,

26
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.290
the USA sent up spy satellites,

27
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.860
which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space.

28
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.990
They didn't see any bombs,

29
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.290
but they did observe faint bursts coming from space lasting only a few seconds

30
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.890
to date.

31
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.390
This may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites that we

32
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:11.320
know about.
Anyway,

33
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.020
astronomers use telescopes that see different kinds of light to make that

34
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.660
discoveries and the spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.

35
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.730
They were a mystery for 30 years,

36
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.760
but eventually we discovered the source of a Grb,

37
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.720
a galaxy 6 billion light years away effort.

38
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:33.010
GRB can be seen from such a distance that it must be incredibly energetic,

39
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.200
releasing more energy in a second,

40
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.420
then the son will and its entire 10 billion year lifetime making GLBS the

41
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:44.050
brightest events in the universe.
So where do they come from?

42
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.780
GLBS accompany some of the most violent cataclysmic deaths in the universe and

43
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:53.500
the birth of black holes.
There are two types of gamma.

44
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:57.280
Ray burst short and long and each has their own source.

45
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.770
Long GRB lost about a minute and scientists think they are produced by
Supernova.

46
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.950
When the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.

47
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.260
Short grps lasts a second and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary

48
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.930
merge over millions of years.

49
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.630
They're all bits decay by emitting gravitational waves.

50
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.680
Once they're close enough to touch,
they crash and splash into each other,

51
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.910
forming a black hole.

52
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.930
Both supernova and neutron star mergers make the same thing.

53
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.120
Black holes surrounded by a magnetized disc of gas leftover from their parents.

54
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.680
Stars in these environments,
the rotation winds up the magnetic field,

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.850
which funnels hot gents of particles traveling at Navy.
The speed of light.

56
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.010
The gas in this funnel create two tight jets of high energy gamma rays like a

57
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.270
celestial days a gun.

58
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.510
So unlike other cosmic explosions which spread out and fade GRBC stay focused

59
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.040
and can be seen from much further,

60
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.510
any more detail would require too much mathematics.
For a youtube video,

61
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.690
the universe is full of these cosmic snipers firing blindly and randomly into

62
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.230
the dark and they're hitting us all the time.
On average,

63
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.220
we detect one per day.
Fortunately,
most are harmless.

64
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.830
All the bursts we have detected so far originated outside the Milky Way too far

65
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:18.664
away to hurt us,

66
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.130
but a nearby GRB could be disastrous if one goes off within a few light years of

67
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.330
us,
it would totally cook the surface of the earth or at least the half that's

68
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:29.164
facing it,

69
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.590
but even a more distant GRB could still end life on earth and it wouldn't need

70
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:36.490
to score a headshot to get us.

71
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.250
If originating from a few thousand light years away,

72
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.610
it would be a hundred light years wide.
By the time it reaches us,

73
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.530
washing over the soda system like a tidal wave.
Again,

74
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:49.120
the ozone layer protects us,

75
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.210
but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultra from the sun.

76
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.880
A gamma ray burst would overwhelm,

77
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.580
is leading US exposed to deadly solar radiation.

78
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.360
Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes,

79
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.650
which is more than enough time for the sun to burn the earth sterile or at least

80
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.130
to kill most complex life.
In fact,

81
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.780
this may have already happened.

82
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.590
A DRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450

83
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.580
million years ago.
The dedicated almost 85% of all marine species,

84
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.620
although it's pretty much impossible to prove gamma ray bursts could even be one

85
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:29.140
reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe.

86
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.190
They might be wiping clean huge chunks of it on a regular basis.

87
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.730
It's been suggested that because of Grps,

88
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.350
only 10% of organic says might be hospitable to life similar to us.

89
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.700
So are they going to kill us?
Probably not.

90
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.800
In a galaxy like ours,

91
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.430
there may only be one GRB per millennia and to harmless,

92
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.220
they must be close and directed at us.

93
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.560
But since gamma rays travel at the speed of light,
we weren't.

94
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.600
No one has headed our way until it arrives.

95
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.620
So there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all and we won't know

96
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.920
until it hits us and we're debt.

97
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.380
This video was sponsored by squarespace.com/nutshell death from the sky could

98
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:18.290
come around any second,
maybe even now.

99
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.940
So you don't have any time to waste.
You don't need to set up a website.

100
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.850
Portfolio or blog is usually hard and time consuming,

101
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.800
not so with Squarespace though they let you set up a page with easily

102
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:35.360
understandable tools very quickly and without any knowledge of Web design you

103
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.240
can use the code nutshell to save 10% and support courts.

104
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.900
Cozart Squarespace had been a great sponsor so give them some love.

105
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.370
You can support us directly yet patrion or get coats cause onto march hare.

106
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.340
It really helps.
Over the next few months,

107
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.610
we'd like to make more videos about cataclysmic destructive events because

108
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.770
honestly,
it's a lot of fun to make these.

109
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.820
If you have any ideas about what kind of doomsday scenario you'd like to learn

110
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:02.600
about,
let us know in the comments and if you need to kill a little more time.

111
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:03.080
Now,

112
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.760
here are a few related videos or maybe now.
