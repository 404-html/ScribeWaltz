1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.870
Everybody feels lonely from time to time when we have no one to sit next to at

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.881
lunch when we moved to new city or when nobody has time for us and the weekend.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.930
But over the last few decades,

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.820
this occasional feeding has become chronic familiar ones.
In the UK,

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.090
60% of 18 to 34 year olds say they often feel lonely in the u s 46% of the

6
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:29.710
entire population feel lonely regularly.

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.590
We are living in the most connected time in human history and yet an

8
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.410
unprecedented number of us and feel isolated,

9
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.790
being lonely and being alone.
I'm not the same thing.

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.200
You can be filled with blessed by herself and hate every second surrounded by

11
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.034
France.

12
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.020
Loneliness is a purely subjective individual experience.

13
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.140
If you feel lonely,
you are lonely.

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.330
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how

15
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.180
to talk to people or how to behave around others,

16
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.400
but population based studies have shown that social skills make practically no

17
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.310
difference for adults when it comes to social connections,

18
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.400
loneliness can affect everybody.
Money,
fame,
power,
beauty,

19
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.890
social skills,
a great personality.

20
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.080
Nothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.

21
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.090
Loneliness is a bodily function like hunger.

22
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.960
Hunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.

23
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.710
Learners makes you pay attention to your social needs.

24
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.960
Your body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago,

25
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.990
it was a great indicator of how likely you are to survive natural selection,

26
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:56.440
rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections with each

27
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.274
other.

28
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.200
Our brains grew and became more and more fine tuned to recognize what others

29
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.680
thought and felt and to form and sustain social bonds.

30
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.340
Being social became part of our biology.

31
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.510
You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people,

32
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.430
which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.
Getting enough calories,

33
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.560
staying safe and warm or caring for offspring was practically impossible.
Alone.

34
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.480
Being together meant survival.
Being alone meant death,

35
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
so it was crucial,
but you got along with others for your ancestors.

36
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:37.690
The most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,

37
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.960
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded to avoid that

38
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.060
your body came up with social pain.

39
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.500
Hainer vest kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection,

40
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.930
a sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behavior that would isolate

41
00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:00.700
you,
your ancestors who experienced as more painful.

42
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.200
We're more likely to change their behavior when they got rejected and thus state

43
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.460
and the tribe,
while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died.

44
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.810
That's why rejections hurt and even more so why luminous is so painful.

45
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.730
These mechanisms for keeping US connected worked great for most of our history

46
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.330
until humans began building a new world for themselves.

47
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.060
The loneliness epidemic we see today.
Radio knee started in the late renaissance.

48
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.420
Western culture began to focus on the individual.

49
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.860
Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages while the

50
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.550
young Protestant theology stress to individual responsibility.

51
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
This trend accelerated during the industrial revolution.
People left there,

52
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.990
but it is and fields to enter factories.

53
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.050
Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve.
Well,

54
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.340
cities grew as our world rapidly became modern.

55
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.830
This trend sped up more and more.

56
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.420
Today we move vast distances for new jobs,

57
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.530
love and education and leave our social net behind.

58
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.510
We meet fewer people in person and we meet them less often than in the past.

59
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.530
In the u s the mean number of close friends dropped from three and 1985 to two

60
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.560
in 2011

61
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.660
most people stumbled into chronic loneliness by accident.

62
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.430
You reach adulthood and become busy with work,
university,
Romance,

63
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.850
kids and Netflix.
There's just not enough time,

64
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.680
the most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice his time with friends.

65
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.600
Did you wake up one day and realize that you feel isolated?

66
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.150
The two yen foot,
close relationships,
but it's hard to find clothes,

67
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:59.230
connections as adults and so loneliness can become chronic.

68
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.360
While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and space ships,

69
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.220
our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same.
The worth 50,000 years ago,

70
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.870
we are still biologically fine tunes to being with each other.

71
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.900
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

72
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.650
<v 0>large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic luminesce</v>

73
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.700
is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans.

74
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.040
It makes you age quicker.

75
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.000
It makes cancer deadlier Alzheimer's advanced faster.

76
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.950
Your immune system's weaker.

77
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.850
Loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of

78
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:41.210
cigarettes a day.

79
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.040
The most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic,

80
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.930
it can become self sustaining.

81
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.020
Physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain both feel like a

82
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:59.021
threat and so social pain leads to to and defensive behavior when it's inflicted

83
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.200
on you.
When loneliness becomes chronic,

84
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.840
your brain goes into self preservation load.

85
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.590
It starts to see danger and hostility everywhere,

86
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.270
but that's not all.
Some studies found that when you're lonely,

87
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:17.900
your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals.

88
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.980
While at the same time it gets worse at interpreting them correctly.

89
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.150
You pay more attention to others,
but you understand them less.

90
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.550
The part of your brain that recognizes faces gets out of tune and becomes more

91
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.550
likely to categorize neutral faces as hostile,

92
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.560
which makes it distrustful of others.

93
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.240
Loneliness makes you assume the worst about other's intentions towards you.

94
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.780
Because of this perceived hostile world,

95
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.440
you can become a more self centered to protect yourself,

96
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.330
which can make you appear more cold,
unfriendly and socially awkward.

97
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.230
The new radiar

98
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.120
f loneliness has become a strong presence in your life.

99
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.020
The first thing you can do is to try to recognize the vicious cycle you may be

100
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:09.470
trapped in.
It usually goes something like this.

101
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.120
An initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness,

102
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.200
which makes you focus your attention selectively on negative interactions with

103
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:23.030
others.
This makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative,

104
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.250
which then changes your behavior.
You begin to avoid social interaction,

105
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.160
which leads to more feelings of isolation.

106
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.870
This cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time.

107
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.390
Loneliness makes you sit far away from others in class,
not answer the phone.

108
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:45.620
When friends call decline invitations until the invitation stop.

109
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.430
Each and every one of us has a story about ourselves and if your story becomes

110
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.640
the people exclude you,

111
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.650
others pick up on that and so the outside world can become the way you feel

112
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:58.484
about it.

113
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.180
This is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression

114
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.860
and a mental state that prevents connections.
Even if you yearn for them.

115
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.710
The first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a

116
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:17.090
totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of.

117
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.200
Literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life.

118
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.780
It's a universal human experience.

119
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.850
You can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically,

120
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.390
but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of.

121
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:37.391
It's cause you can self examine what you focus your attention on and check if

122
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.940
you are selectively concentrating on negative things.

123
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.600
Was this interaction with a colleague ready negative or was it really neutral or

124
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:51.050
even positive?
What was the actual content of an interaction?

125
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
What did the other person say and did they say something bad or did you add

126
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.860
extra meaning to their words?
Maybe another person was not ready,

127
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.590
reacting negatively,
but just short on time.

128
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.900
Then there are your thoughts about the world.

129
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.990
Are you assuming the worst about other's intentions?

130
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.610
Do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go?

131
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.520
Do you assume others don't want you around?

132
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.140
Are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up,

133
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.310
and if so,
can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt?

134
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.430
Can you just assume that they're not against you?

135
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.410
Can you risk being open and vulnerable again and lastly,

136
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.150
your behavior?
Are you avoiding opportunities to be around others?

137
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.690
Are you looking for excuses to decline invitations or are you pushing others

138
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:47.280
away preemptively to protect yourself?

139
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.100
Are you acting as if you're getting a tax?

140
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.450
Are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with

141
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.150
your situation?
Of course,

142
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.330
every person and situation is unique and different and just introspection alone

143
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.320
might not be enough.
If you feel unable to solve your situation by yourself,

144
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.050
please try to reach out and get professional help.

145
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.580
It's not a sign of weakness but have courage.
However,

146
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:18.750
we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to

147
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.380
create more personal happiness or as a public health crisis.

148
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.870
It is something that deserves right more attention.

149
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.750
Humans have built a world that's nothing short of amazing,

150
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.110
and yet none of the shiny things we've made is able to satisfy or substitute our

151
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:37.120
fundamental biological need for connection.

152
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.200
Most animals get what they need from their physical surroundings.

153
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.410
We get what we need from each other and we need to build our artificial human

154
00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:47.740
world.
Based on that.

155
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.560
Let's try something together.
Let's reach out to someone today.

156
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.600
Regardless if you feel a little bit low knee or if you want to make someone

157
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:05.620
else's day better,
maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while.

158
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:11.220
Call a family member who's become a strange invite a work buddy for a coffee or

159
00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:15.700
just go to something you're usually too afraid to go to or too lazy to go to

160
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.040
like a d and d event or a sports club.

161
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.340
Everybody's different so you know what's a good fit for you.

162
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.760
Maybe nothing will come of it and that's okay.

163
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.430
Don't do this with any expectations.

164
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.770
The goal is just to open up a base to exercise your connection muscles so they

165
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:36.940
can grow stronger over time or to help others exercise them.

166
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.860
We want to recommend two of the books we read while researching this video.

167
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.590
Emotional first aid by Guy Wench,
a book that addresses among other topics,

168
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.360
how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionable and

169
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.610
load in s human nature and the need for social connection by John Cacioppo and

170
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:58.480
William Patrick.

171
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.550
It's an entertaining and scientific exploration as to why we experience

172
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:07.330
loneliness on a biological level,
how it spread in society,

173
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.700
and what science has to say about how to escape as links for both books and the

174
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.570
video description.
