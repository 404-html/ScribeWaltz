00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.690
Human society is extremely complex and fragile,

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.440
built upon various pillars.
One of them is the honeybee.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.240
One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honey bees.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.970
thousands of plants would follow,

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
which could lead to millions of people starving in the following years.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.840
On top of that,
honeybees have a huge economic impact.

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.050
The dollar value of plants pollinated by them each year is around 265 billion.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.900
The food we take for granted with just stop existing without them all,

10
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.280
there would be a massive decrease in productivity food including apples,
onions,

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.941
pumpkin's,

12
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.660
and also plants use for feeding livestock and thus extremely important for our

13
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.370
MILCON meat.
Einstein is often quoted as having said,
if honeybees die out,

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
humans will follow.
A few years later,
actually he probably didn't say that,

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.500
but there might be some truth in the statement.
It's unsettling,

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.960
but honeybees have started to disappear.

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.020
Millions of hives have died in the last few years.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30 to 90% of their

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.610
colonics.
In the u s alone.

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
Bees are steadily declining from 5 million hives in 1988 to 2.5 million today

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
since 2006 a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder has affected honeybees

22
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.540
in many countries and we're not entirely sure what's causing it.

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.420
All we know is that it's pretty serious.

24
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.600
Over the last few decades,
bees have seen an invasion of very dangerous foes,

25
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.940
parasites straight out of a horror movie like a carrot pissed woody microscopic

26
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.941
mites that in fact the trickier that's the breathing tubes of bees here they lay

27
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.940
their eggs,
eggs,
and feed from the fluids of their victims,

28
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.830
weakening them considerably and spending their whole life inside the bees or

29
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.330
Varroa destructor a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee

30
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:04.030
hives and are one of the bees greatest enemies.

31
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.830
The female might ant as a honeybee brute south and lays eggs on the beloved

32
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.970
before it's about to pupate and before the hive bees covered the cell with a wax

33
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:17.110
capping the eggs hatch and the young mites in their mother feed on the

34
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.570
developing be in the safety of the capsule.

35
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.970
The B is not normally killed at this stage,

36
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.780
just weakened so it still has enough strength to chew it's way through the wax

37
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.930
capping and release itself from the south.
As it does,

38
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
it releases the mother might and her new offspring from the south and these are

39
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:34.360
free to spread across the hive.

40
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.020
Starting the process over again in a cycle of about 10 days.

41
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.460
Their numbers grow exponentially and after a few months this can lead to the

42
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:46.180
collapse of the entire beehive.
Once outside of the cell,

43
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.270
adult Mites also sunk the bodily fluids of bees and we can them considerably to

44
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:52.330
make things worse.

45
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.650
They also transmit viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth

46
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:58.300
defects like useless wings,

47
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.410
but are other threats to such as viruses and fungus.

48
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.360
Under normal circumstances,

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.590
these phenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the

50
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.220
horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.
Over recent years,

51
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.310
new insecticides have been introduced at the darn deadly to bs neonicotinoids.

52
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.060
A chemical family similar to nicotine was approved in the early 1990s as an

53
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.370
alternative to chemicals like Ddt.

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.310
They attack in sex by harming their nervous systems.

55
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.080
Today they are the most widely used insecticides in the world.
Globally.

56
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:37.081
They saw sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2008 representing 24% of the Global

57
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.871
Market for insecticides in 2013 neonicotinoids were used in the u s about 95% of

58
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.900
corn and canola crops and also on the vast majority of fruit and vegetable

59
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.160
<v 1>like apples,
cherries,
peaches,
oranges.
There is leafy greens,</v>

60
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.080
tomatoes,
potatoes,
cereal,
grains,
rice,
knucks,
grapes,

61
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
and many more.

62
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.260
<v 0>These come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen all via</v>

63
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:05.400
contaminated water,

64
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.660
often bringing material into the hive where it can accumulate and slowly kill

65
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:10.590
the whole colony.

66
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.900
The toxins harm bees in a variety of horrible ways.
In high enough doses,

67
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.790
it quickly leads to convulsions,
paralysis and death,
but even in small doses,

68
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:24.780
it can be fatal.
It mainly to B's forgetting how to navigate the world,

69
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.410
so bees fly into the wild,
get lost and die alone,

70
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.830
separated from their hives.
If this happens often enough,

71
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.680
a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself.

72
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.360
We know that near nicotine IEDs are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an

73
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:43.890
alternative to it,
but there are billions of dollars to be made in delaying.

74
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.060
This study is sponsored by the chemical industry magically appear to prove a

75
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.920
much lower toxicity to bs compared to those produced by independent scientists.

76
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.270
There are even more factors contributing to the demise of B's like too much

77
00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:59.730
genetic uniformity,
crop monocultures,

78
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.440
poor nutrition due to overcrowding stress because of human activities and other

79
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.640
pesticides.
Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for bees,

80
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.760
but together they probably account for colony collapse disorder with a parasites

81
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.270
upping their game.
In recent decades,
the honeybees are now fighting for survival.

82
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.300
It would be a catastrophe if they lost this fight.

83
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.190
This is a conundrum we have to solve if we want to continue living with a

84
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.800
relative abundance and diversity of food.

85
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.600
Humanity is deeply interconnected with earth and the other life forms on it.

86
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.640
Even if we pretend that we're not,

87
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.720
we have to take better care of our surroundings if not to preserve the beauty of

88
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:42.600
nature than at least to ensure our own survival.
