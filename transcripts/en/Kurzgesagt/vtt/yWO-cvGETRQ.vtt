00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.750
Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.250
Strong enough to rip holes stars into atom sized pieces.
Well,

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:12.660
this is scary enough.
They have an even more powerful than dark property.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.870
They might delete the universe itself.

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.690
Black holes in a nutshell,

6
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.360
a black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a

7
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.520
tiny space at their center.

8
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.740
Gravity is almost infinitely strong and whatever gets too close is wrapped into

9
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.090
its elementary particles.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.280
Not even light can escape black holes and so we perceive them as fairs of

11
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.550
blackness.
If you were to fall into a black hole,

12
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.880
nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed it's outer border.

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.020
The event horizon,

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.210
you can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.100
As you float along imperceptibly,
the stream gets faster and faster.

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.020
Even if you can't see the waterfall yet,

17
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.210
you could swim to safety until without even noticing as you crossed the point of

18
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.210
no return,
no matter how fast you try to swim.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.000
Now the stream we'll pull you towards sudden death.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.020
Nothing can escape a black whole waterfall.
Once it gets to close,

21
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
this border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe.

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.360
We can't access them unless we're willing to never return.

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.320
So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes.

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.830
But we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their various ages.

25
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.560
Black holes radiate their mass away like a hot pot on a stove losing its water

26
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.530
esteem.
This is called Hawking radiation.

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.370
Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass.

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.980
The process that's unbelievably slow,

29
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
it will take a black hole with the mass of our sun.
10,000 billion,
billion,

30
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.050
billion,
billion,
billion,
billion years to lose.

31
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.230
0.0,
zero,

32
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.150
zero 1% of its mass.

33
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.890
This is happening constantly and unstoppable and as it goes on,

34
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.070
it speeds up more and more and the fallen far future when the last star in the

35
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:18.120
universe has been dead for trillions of years,

36
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.950
black hold will become tinier and Tinier until they evaporate and disappear,

37
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.410
leaving behind just a bit of radiation.

38
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.160
But this is a problem because in the process of disappearing,

39
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.310
black holes might delete something fundamental information to what is

40
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.210
inflammation.
Inflammation is nothing tangible.

41
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.570
It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of articles.

42
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.500
What does this mean?
Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms,

43
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.140
arrange them in a certain way and you get cold.

44
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.140
Arrange them in a different way and you get a diamond.

45
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.030
The atoms of the same,
what changes is the inflammation.

46
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.000
If we make this more and add in a few more items,

47
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.350
we get a banana change the arrangement of the atoms and we got a squirrel.

48
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.600
The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same and don't

49
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:15.601
care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee without information.

50
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.860
Everything in the universe would be the same according to the theory of quantum

51
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:25.480
mechanics.
Information is indestructable.
It might change shape,

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.340
but it can never be lost.
For example,
if you burn a piece of paper,
you guys ash,

53
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.500
that ash will never become paper again.
But if you were able to,
Cathy,

54
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.580
collect every single carbon atom in the ash and measured the exact properties of

55
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.030
the smoke and heat radiating from the fire,
you could in theory,

56
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:47.800
reconstruct the paper.
The information of the paper is still in the universe.

57
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.590
It's not lost.
It's just hard to read.

58
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.450
If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle and wave of

59
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:56.800
radiation in the universe,

60
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.570
you could see and track every bit of information there is.
Hypothetically,

61
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.690
you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the big bag and

62
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.460
here black holes trip us up.

63
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.500
Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to

64
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.170
be,
what black holes do the opposite.

65
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.210
They take different things and make them the same.
They destroy information.

66
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.880
This creates the information paradox and this is a serious problem.

67
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.020
The information paradox,

68
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.110
it's fundamental for all our laws of physics.
That information can never be lost,

69
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.390
existing,
not existing without information.
Everything is relative.

70
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.980
When it comes to our understanding of reality,
we need absolute,

71
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.900
how could we solve this paradox?
There are a few possibilities.

72
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.730
One information is lost irretrievably and forever.

73
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.580
This means we have to Nix all our laws of physics,

74
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.000
throwing out a lot of stuff that's worked very well so far and to start from

75
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:08.590
scratch what those new laws of physics would look like or what that means for
us.

76
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.440
Nobody knows this is a little frightening,

77
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.640
but also kind of exciting to information is hidden.

78
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.830
Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby university.

79
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.920
The information would be transferred into this new weird place where we could

80
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:27.580
never observe or interact with it,
but technically it would not be Knaust.

81
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.480
It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos that you could

82
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:33.370
never access.
Sure.

83
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.820
It's nice that they've not been deleted but also not very helpful.

84
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.020
Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life

85
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:44.470
cycles,
but a little piece is left and information diamond,

86
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.730
like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information.
Clowns,

87
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.400
but there's a third option.
Information is safe after all,
not lost or hidden.

88
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.710
Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way.

89
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.760
We know the black holes,
trap information and might delete it later,

90
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.370
but we'd never thought about what they do with it.
In the meantime,

91
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.100
where two black holes store their information,

92
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.700
cosmic housekeeping.

93
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.380
Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry.

94
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.050
First we fill up a room with laundry baskets.

95
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.650
The more laundry you want to store the mall baskets you put in the room,

96
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.350
but at some point every single basket is full and the room is completely
stacked.

97
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.660
Not a single extra sock.
Phets in the room is at maximum capacity,

98
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.830
but if we still squeeze a sock in with a lot of energy and violence,

99
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.130
the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole,

100
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.490
but the capacity of the room itself has not changed.

101
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.580
Fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible.

102
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.760
So what happens if we throw more laundry into it?

103
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.740
The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information.

104
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.060
It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel.

105
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.110
For each bit of information we throw into it.
In a nutshell,

106
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.750
more information means more surface area.

107
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.540
The information gets painted on the surface.

108
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.950
Similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond after the stone sinks

109
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.750
to the bottom,
we can't see it anymore,

110
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.320
but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the

111
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:19.154
pond.

112
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.720
Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface than all

113
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.820
the data ever produced in human history.

114
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.400
They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably
tiny.

115
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.890
Black holes are the ultimate hard drive.

116
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.670
This is a bit like taking a paperback and turning it into an ebook to things

117
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:43.610
that look completely different,
but their content is the same.

118
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.290
It's just encoded and memorized in another way.
Black holes,

119
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.490
swallowing stars and planets is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an

120
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.270
ereader.
This solution is called the holographic principle,

121
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.620
but if it's correct,

122
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.980
then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong.

123
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.480
The universe is a Hologram.

124
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.450
If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole,

125
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.320
the hawking radiation has a chance of learning about the information encoded

126
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:16.850
that and can carry it away.

127
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.820
So information is not lost when black holes fade away and we do not need to Redo

128
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.910
physics.
The information paradox is resolved,

129
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.470
but we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way.

130
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.670
If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon,

131
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.990
that basically means that three dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface.

132
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.910
We have a name for this.
The hologram,
a Hologram is like a three d photo,

133
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.540
a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three dimensional image.

134
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.370
A black hole is like a hologram because everything incited is encoded on its

135
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:53.204
event horizon.

136
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.020
The person inside black hole would experience their usual three dimensional
life,

137
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.970
but for us on the outside,

138
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.760
they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole.

139
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.290
The consequence of this is counterintuitive,
but stay with us for a moment.

140
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.020
Black holes are very extreme objects,

141
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.660
but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else.

142
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.220
So if there's crazy duality between two D and three d works for black holes,

143
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.550
then it might work for the whole universe and you in it.

144
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.990
Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a

145
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.300
flat surface,
we might share the same fate.

146
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.500
You really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe.

147
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The science behind this is complicated and ready wade with toy universities to

148
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.590
play with string theory and a lot of mass.

149
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.050
We'll talk about this more in another video.

150
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.650
Regardless of what the true nature of the universe is,

151
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.940
we just know that it's strange and complicated and we have to do a lot more

152
