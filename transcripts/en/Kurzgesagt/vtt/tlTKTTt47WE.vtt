1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.760
We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world,

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.300
so we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.500
Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.270
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.
In the future.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.200
It might become possible to simulate entire universities,

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.090
but if this is an option,
how can we know that it's not already happened?

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.100
What if we are not creators,
but creations?

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.110
Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

10
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.070
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

11
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.630
then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and

12
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.390
trillions of things,
but we don't actually need to anyway.

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitance of our simulation into

14
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.300
thinking that they real who needs billions of galaxies.

15
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.050
We only need the space.
Our subjects are allowed to explore.

16
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.010
The best universe can just be a flat projection and they would have no way to

17
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:22.844
know.

18
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.300
What about small things like cells or bacteria?
We don't really need them.

19
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.100
When you use a microscope,
once you see could be instantly created.

20
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.200
Same with atoms.

21
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.980
The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be stimulated with

22
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.460
quadrillions of atoms.
We just need the outermost layer of it.

23
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.150
It might be empty and size until you decide to break it open.

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.930
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubby things,

25
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.780
but it might be empty until you open it.

26
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.390
The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of Allen

27
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.160
virtual humans.
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

28
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
Okay,
so,
oh,
we being simulated.
Well maybe,

29
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.690
but there are a few conditions that need to be mass.

30
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.090
Obviously we have no authority over this topic,

31
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.890
so please take everything we say with a grain of salt based on a modified

32
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.740
version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom.

33
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.830
We have five assumptions for you.
If they're true,
you,
dear viewer,

34
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.040
are living in a simulation assumption.
One,

35
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.620
it's possible to simulate consciousness.

36
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.570
Nobody knows what consciousness is.
For the sake of argument.

37
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.410
Let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

38
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.200
Brains are pretty complex.

39
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.270
If you count every interaction between Synapsis is one operation,

40
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.510
your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17 or 100 million billion operations

41
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.273
per second.

42
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 1>Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations does simulate</v>

43
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.010
one second of human consciousness.
Well,
we don't want to simulate just one human.

44
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.360
We want to see me like all of human history at once,
so we can skip around.

45
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.900
Let's say we want us to be like 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of

46
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.770
50 years.

47
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.340
One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years times 200 billion humans times 10

48
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.200
to the power of 20 operations.

49
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.220
<v 0>So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion,
trillion,</v>

50
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.250
trillion operations per second more operations than there are stars in the

51
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:41.730
observable universe.
The computer like this is just impossible,

52
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.830
except maybe it isn't.

53
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.470
The assumption to technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

54
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.170
If we assume the technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has

55
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:55.890
so far,

56
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.150
then there might be galaxy spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power

57
00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:00.984
at some point.

58
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.520
Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them

59
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:09.780
from God's a computer that can handle a million,
trillion,
trillion,

60
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:11.850
trillion operations is serious business,

61
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.180
but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.

62
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.040
The matryoshka brain is a theoretical mega structure made up of billions of

63
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.560
parts orbiting a star feeding on his radiation.

64
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.810
They or of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands if not

65
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:30.120
millions of humanities at the same time.

66
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.100
The technologies like high end future quantum computers might lower the size

67
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:35.934
drastically,

68
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.900
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city or

69
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:44.490
even smaller,
but only if they're still somewhat around to build the computer

70
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.610
assumption.
Three advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

71
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.200
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroyed themselves,

72
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.620
this whole discussion ends here.
Looking into space,

73
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.670
you'd expect to universe filled with millions of alien civilizations,

74
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.110
but we see nobody.
The reason for this might be great filters.

75
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.970
Great filters are barriers.
Life has to overcome like nuclear war,

76
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.360
asteroid climate change or a black hole generator.

77
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.550
If life is inherently self destructive,
then there are no simulations.

78
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.360
We explain this in more detail in our family paradox.
Video

79
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.110
assumption for super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.

80
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.360
When we speak of post human civilizations,
we don't know what we're dealing with.

81
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.520
To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.

82
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.870
Imagine the smartest and on earth living next to an amusement park.

83
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.800
It's curious about what humans are up to so you try to explain.

84
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.880
Unfortunately the aunt just doesn't understand the concept of rollercoasters and

85
00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:58.430
standing in lines and holidays and fun.

86
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.250
It doesn't make sense to an aunt living and and life.

87
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.990
It's the same with us and a post human being compared to them.

88
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.140
We are ants running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid

89
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:16.451
ideas of them but if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons and

90
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.710
assumptions one to three are true to,

91
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.040
then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation assumption

92
00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:28.200
five f there are a lot of simulations.

93
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.870
You are probably inside a simulation.

94
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.270
If there are simulated civilizations,
it's likely that there are a lot of them.

95
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.410
After all,

96
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.580
we assume the post human beings have access to practically unlimited computing

97
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:44.040
power.
So if they run simulations,

98
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.130
it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.

99
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.130
If there are billions of simulated universes,

100
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.390
there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,

101
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.200
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that we'll ever

102
00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:00.150
have existed,
oh,
simulate it.

103
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.730
So for every conscious being made a flesh,
a billion simulated ones,
yeah,
exist.

104
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.200
<v 1>Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not.
In this case,</v>

105
00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:16.201
the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulator ones are pretty high.

106
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:22.630
So what you consider reality might not be real at all.

107
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.300
You really might be simulated.

108
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.700
<v 0>All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right
now.</v>

109
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.060
So many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.

110
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.750
So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.

111
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.350
If you are simulated.
Not that much changes for you.

112
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.370
You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness or a

113
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.020
simulation and side computer.

114
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.980
Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.

115
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.930
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time and hope

116
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:59.050
that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer,

117
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.150
nobody trips over the power cable.

118
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.860
<v 1>Oh,
oh,
oh no.
I think I just unplugged the simulation,</v>

119
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.720
but what if that doesn't matter?
What if we are in one right now?

120
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.800
What if you are simulated

121
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.900
<v 0>j covert at least or three is looking into that.</v>
