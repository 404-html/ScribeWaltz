1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.750
If you had to choose right now,
how long would you want to live?

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.790
80 years.
9,120 longer.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.170
And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.790
50,000 years ago,
most humans died very young.

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.630
As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves,

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.750
this got better and better.
Today,

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.260
humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before,

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.320
but this has an unforeseen consequence.

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.730
We spend an ever increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.040
Most of us will die in a hospital bed,
which is depressing enough by itself,

11
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.160
but we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones,

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.120
except maybe we can stop this forever.

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.020
The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.

14
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.180
It saves many more lives.

15
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:58.120
If you stop a million people from smoking than coming up with better

16
00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:02.890
chemotherapies.
So one,
I'll put a halt to the cause of all disease.

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.190
The process of aging.
In a nutshell,

18
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.230
aging is caused by physics and not biology.
Think of cars.

19
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.830
Arts were down from rubbing and grinding.
Metal rusts,
filters get plowed.

20
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.150
The rubber cracks our bodies a worn down by trillions of tiny physical

21
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:27.340
processes,
oxygen,
radiation from the sun.
Our metabolism,

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.030
our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage,

23
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.560
but over time they become less effective.
So loud bones and muscles.

24
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.010
We can ask any wrinkles.
Our immune system gets weaker,

25
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.310
we lose our memory and our senses diminish.

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.430
There's no such thing as dying of old age.

27
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.230
We'll die because one of our important parts breaks.
The older we gas,

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.270
the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases takeover

29
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.330
and killers unnoticed by most of us.

30
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.530
Longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.

31
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.963
For the first time,

32
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.260
we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate

33
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.770
them.
Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable,

34
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.160
and we might be able to stop or delayed during your lifetime.

35
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.600
We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop this

36
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.670
in another video,
but first,
if we could,
should we end aging?

37
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.710
Is this a good idea?

38
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.710
The end of aging or life extension makes many people uncomfortable.

39
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.580
We're born a young,
become older and there'll be dying.

40
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.290
This has been the natural order for literally all of human history and getting

41
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.490
old is a good thing,
right?

42
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.750
We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age.

43
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.030
We even called them the golden years,

44
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.150
but the reality is that everybody wants to become old,

45
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.160
but nobody wants to be old.
Think of the Greek myth of to thoroughness.

46
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.610
For example,
two furnace,
the lover of the Goddess Eos,

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.590
and probably an amazing dude because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality so

48
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.360
they could spend eternity together,

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
but she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth to Furniss was granted

50
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.090
eternal life,
but he kept eating unable to die.

51
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.160
After a few hundred years,

52
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.210
he was reduced to the size of a grape babbling on senselessly forever.

53
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.100
Thousands of years ago.
Humans already fares neverending old age,

54
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.990
but ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker.
If you become too old,

55
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.340
it's too late and 90 year old who stopped teaching would die anyway.

56
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.270
After a few years,
too much damage has been done to his internal machinery.

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.830
There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.
Instead,

58
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.570
the concept of life extension promises to Ann's diseases and with them the end

59
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.950
of a fixed maximum age.
We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.

60
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.940
We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of

61
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.740
around 120 all.

62
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.100
We might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.

63
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.880
Nobody knows that this point,
what's possible.
Okay,

64
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
but even if we could achieve that,
should we?
Well,

65
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.310
life extension is ready.

66
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.570
Just another phrase for medicine or the doctors are doing is trying to prolong

67
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.070
life and to minimize suffering.

68
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.690
The vast majority of health care resources are spent on the consequences of

69
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.524
aging.

70
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.610
Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior

71
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:29.950
years and another third during middle age.

72
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.390
We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine.

73
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.400
We're just doing it very inefficiently.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.290
Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a

75
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:46.000
heart treating cancer with chemotherapy,
using antibiotics or vaccines.

76
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.770
Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore and we enjoy the highest

77
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.050
standard of living ever.
As a consequence of that,

78
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.520
what we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is

79
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:02.200
failing and then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as

80
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.690
well as we can.
One,
it breaks down even further,

81
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.050
but life extension still feels hubristic.

82
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.100
Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age,

83
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.690
and this might still be true.

84
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.650
The idea of avoiding death and Tylee is off putting for many,

85
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.450
the end of biological aging would not mean the end of death in any way.

86
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.530
It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid and your mom calls you

87
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.710
inside.
You just wanted to keep playing,

88
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.830
have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.

89
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.810
It's not about playing outside forever,
just a little longer until we feel tired.

90
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.670
If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live

91
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:46.780
in good health for another 100 or 200 years,
how would this change us?

92
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.100
Would we take better care of our planet?
If we knew we would be around longer?

93
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.040
If we could work for 150 years,

94
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.010
how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at?

95
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.760
How much more time would we spend learning would the intense feeling of pressure

96
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.870
and stress?
Many of us are feeling right now,
go away or get worse.

97
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.570
So asking again,

98
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.950
if you could choose how long to live right now in good health and with your

99
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.740
friends and family,
what's your personal answer?

100
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.950
What would you like your future to look like?

101
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.190
But maybe you are still unconvinced.

102
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.430
Some nagging feeling remains that is the reaper whispering into your brain.

103
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.140
Watch my video to hear what he says and why you shouldn't listen.

104
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.140
Your eternal future may depend on it.
