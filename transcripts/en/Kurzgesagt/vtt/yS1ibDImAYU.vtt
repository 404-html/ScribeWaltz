1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.831
Space.

2
00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:06.480
Travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.450
undertaken,
but in an irony of history,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.350
we may stop ourselves from going into space.
The more we do it.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.570
With every rocket launched and with every satellite deploys,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.760
we are creating a trap for ourselves that gets deadlier and more dangerous every

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.230
year.
If it's ever activated,

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
it could end the space age and trappers on our planet for decades or even

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.894
centuries.

10
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.643
Yeah,

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.420
<v 1>okay.</v>

12
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.140
<v 0>Guessing something into space is incredibly hard to do,</v>

13
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:49.550
so you need to move very,
very fast at first,
straight up to leave the atmosphere,

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.590
then sideways to begin a sort of circling around the earth still very,
very fast.

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480
If you do that successfully,

16
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.080
you can enter a low earth orbit and once in always,

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.430
it's very hard to get out of always unless you have energy despair,

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.730
you're sort of locked in here,
falling around the earth forever.

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.010
That's great for things.
We want to stay up like space stations and satellites,

20
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.510
and so we moved the majority of humanities space infrastructure to this place

21
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.090
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface,

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.340
just high enough so that the atmosphere is so thin that orbiting things can stay

23
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:29.300
up for centuries before our resistance can slow them enough to bring the back to

24
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:33.530
Earth.
But this is also the source of our deadly trap.

25
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.450
Rockets are really metal cylinders.
The key big piles of fueled in place.

26
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.000
Whenever a portion of the fuel has been spent,

27
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.000
the empty tanks are drops to make the rocket lighter.

28
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.750
Some parts crashed down to earth or burn up in the atmosphere,

29
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.490
but most of the useless rocket parts stay up and begin to orbit the planet.

30
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.160
After decades of space travel.
Low Earth orbit is a junk yard of spent boosters,

31
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.930
broken satellites and millions of pieces of shrapnel from missile tests and

32
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:03.764
explosions.

33
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.480
Right now we know of around 2,600 defunct satellites,

34
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.070
10,000 objects bigger than a monitor,
20,000 as large as an apple,

35
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.280
500,000 pieces the size of a marble and at least 100 million parts so small they

36
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:19.970
can't be tracked.

37
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.040
This debris is moving at speeds of up to 30,000 kilometers per hour.

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.670
So Lynn Earth on criss crossing orbits multiple times a day.

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.250
Orbital speeds are so fast.

40
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.320
The being hit by be the size of a pea is like being shot by a plasma gun on

41
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:40.370
impacts the debrief vaporizes releasing enough energy to punch holes straight

42
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.390
through solid metal.

43
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.310
So we've covered the space around our kindness with millions of deadly pieces of

44
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.810
destruction and we also put a trillion dollar global infrastructure network

45
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.470
right in the danger zone.
It performs critical duties,

46
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.560
essential to the modern world,
global communication,

47
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.990
gps navigation,
collecting weather data,

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.850
looking out for asteroids and all manner of scientific discoveries.

49
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.140
Things we would miss very much if they suddenly went away.

50
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.900
If just one piece size bullet hits one of our 1,100 working satellites,

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.700
it will be destroyed instantly.

52
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.100
Three or four satellites are already being destroyed this way every year as the

53
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:27.900
number of satellites and the amount of junk and orbit is expected to grow 10

54
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.000
fold in the next decade.
We're approaching a tipping point,

55
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.900
but the worst thing in space is not tiny pieces of junk.

56
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.610
The worst thing would be an unstoppable chain reaction that turns a lot of non

57
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.520
junk things into junk.
For example,

58
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.500
if two satellites had each other in just the right way,
if satellites collide,

59
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.300
they don't stop and fall out of the sky.
It's more of a splash that a crash.

60
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.430
Orbital speeds are so fast,
sorted pieces spray right through each other.

61
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.480
Transforming the two satellites into clouds of thousands of little things,

62
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.300
still fast enough to destroy more satellites.

63
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.460
This could trigger the slowest and most destructive sort of domino effects.

64
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.630
A collision cascade like a shotgun spray.

65
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.160
Each collision creates more bullets.
What was once a single tiny target,

66
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.150
very unlikely to hit anything becomes a war of destruction.

67
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.410
Hungry to make more.
As more and more satellites are destroyed,

68
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.900
the destruction accelerates exponentially.

69
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.050
Eventually destroying everything parked in obeys but speaks is very empty so the

70
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.820
first few collisions may take a long time.

71
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.270
By the time we realize what's happening,
it's too late.

72
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.520
One year one satellite is destroyed and that's no big deal.
The next year,

73
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.350
five the year after 50 until there's nothing left.

74
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.780
The situation in orbit is rapidly worsening and we may already be past the point

75
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.360
of no return within 10 years.

76
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.710
Space around Earth may no longer be viable for longterm satellites or rockets.

77
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.950
The worst case scenario is horrifying.

78
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.310
A debris field made of hundreds of millions of pieces,

79
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.720
many too small to track moving at a 30,000 kilometers per hour.

80
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.920
It would effectively create a deadly barrier around earth,

81
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.420
possibly too dangerous to cross dreams of moon bases.

82
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.790
Mars colonies or space travel at all,

83
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.940
maybe sat back centuries and the loss of our space infrastructure would send at

84
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:35.071
some of the technology we rely on daily back to the 1970s but it might not be

85
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.150
too late to clean up our mass.

86
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.750
While the space industry has become better at avoiding space junk,

87
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.500
it's still growing fast and occasional weapon tasks don't help.

88
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.540
So there have been a couple of wild but also serious suggestions about how to

89
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.950
quickly remove as much deadly space junk as possible without creating more in

90
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.784
the process.

91
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.630
Lots of ideas are being thrown around and some of the most seriously considered

92
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.470
involve capture and return missions which are being tested.
Now.

93
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.390
One method involves meeting a piece of junk in orbit with a small satellite and

94
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.280
loaded with a ask.

95
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.690
Once caused a small rocket could be used to bring it down towards earth targets

96
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:18.440
to lunch for an that might be instead caught with a harpoon on a tether.

97
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.450
Instead of firing a rocket,

98
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.950
the cleaner would deploy a large sale to produce atmospheric drag and accelerate

99
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.880
orbital decay.

100
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.510
And there are lots of other wild Saifai sounding proposals to some might use

101
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.110
giant electromagnets.

102
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.370
These magnetic tugs work by pushing on the magnetic components in site

103
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:42.560
satellites that they use to stabilize and orientate themselves in Earth's

104
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:43.520
magnetic field.

105
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.590
These may be safer and more reliable than nets and harpoons because they never

106
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.750
have to make contact with the junk they're handling,

107
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.950
so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up that target into more junk.

108
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.440
As for the tiniest bits of junk lasers might be the key to vaporizing them

109
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:04.460
entirely.
Satellites with lasers wouldn't need to visit their targets.

110
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.470
They can shoot them from far away.
Large objects can't exactly be shot down,

111
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.510
but lasers can be used to ablate or burn tiny amounts of material off the side

112
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.490
to push the junk to a safer or bet whatever technology we use at the end,

113
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.610
we better start doing something soon before 100 million bullets become a

114
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.640
trillion and the trap is set.
If we don't ask,

115
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.320
our adventure in space might end before it's even begun.

116
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.590
If our days of dreaming about space exploration might be numbered anyway,

117
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.090
we better put them to good use.

118
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.960
One of the things we most like to spend our time on is learning more about our

119
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.330
universe and to do that you can just keep watching codes cause aren't an

120

brilliant,
are collaborating on a six part video series.

121

and maths in a practical way by guiding you through problems step by step so you

124
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.180
can actually understand the concepts behind them.
