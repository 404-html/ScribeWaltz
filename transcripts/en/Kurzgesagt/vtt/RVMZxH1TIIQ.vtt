1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
We all prisoners on the universe taunts us by showing us all the places we can't

2
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:11.910
have a visit.
However,
if our species wants to have a longterm future,

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.470
we have to escape our present,
but what's keeping us here in the first place?

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.800
Turns out we are the universe.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.370
A debt that is 4.5 billion years old.

6
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.610
Everything with mass in the universe as tracks,
every other thing with mass,

7
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.680
we call this phenomenon gravity.
The closer you are to a big chunk of mass,

8
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.800
the stronger the attraction or the more your call them.

9
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.830
This effect traps us on earth.

10
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.870
We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity present or a gravity well,

11
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.490
it's not a literal wealth,
but a handy concept to understand how this works.

12
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.440
Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy,

13
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
but how can you oh energy,
because in our universe,

14
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.390
things don't want to change their speed or direction to convince them to move.

15
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.940
You have to expand energy.
Billions of years ago,

16
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.360
the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles

17
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.810
orbiting our son pulled them together until they formed a planet.

18
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.800
This process used energy and created the gravity well.

19
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.550
We're now a part of the deeper you are inside a gravity well,

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.350
the more energy you,
oh gravity.
If you don't find a way to get enough energy,

21
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.500
you're not able to leave no matter what you do because your atoms were once part

22
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:48.740
of the data that the universe expanded energy on to get to this place.

23
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.850
Okay?
Let's summarize all of that again.

24
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.090
Objects in the universe don't like to move.

25
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.490
You have to convince them to do so with energy.

26
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.780
Gravity used energy to convince the parts that make up our Punnett to move

27
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:03.614
together.

28
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
This created a gravity prison in the process trapping us to escape it.

29
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.370
We need to repaired with energy.
Okay,
how do we do that?

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.390
<v 0>To get into space,</v>

32
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:23.080
we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy.

33
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.790
For this purpose.

34
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.710
We build a negative potential energy repaying machines known by them or boring

35
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:30.970
name rockets.

36
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.400
Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know

37
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.550
about to basically explode,
fueled in a controlled way.

38
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.390
This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy.

39
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760
The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards and pushes the rocket away from

40
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:51.580
Earth by expanding a lot of energy.

41
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.550
We are increasing our gravitational potential energy,

42
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.720
which is a complicated way to say that we're paying back our energy debt to

43
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.170
gravity,
but it's actually a lot trickier than that.

44
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.570
When you burn fuel to get into all this,

45
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.040
you lose lots of energy to heat the exhaust and atmospheric drag,

46
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.170
so you actually need much more as you can't just part a huge amount of really

47
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.400
explosive,
dangerous for your close to your payload detonated.

48
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.360
You need a controlled burn,

49
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.480
which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy,

50
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.800
which means it has more mass.
The more mass something has,

51
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.350
the more energy you need to convince it to move,

52
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.300
so you need more fuel to lift up your rocket,
but if you need more fuel,

53
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.940
that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel.

54
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.570
But this makes sure rocket heavier,
thus requiring more fuel,

55
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.560
which requires more rocket to carry that new fuel and so on.

56
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.270
At the end of this madness,

57
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.570
you need closer to a hundred times the weight of your payload.

58
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.470
To launch Ariana six for example,
the European rocket,

59
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.710
we'll wait 800 tons and should be able to transport 10 times into geostationary

60
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.770
transfer always,
or 20 tons into medium earth orbit,

61
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.670
but a rocket can only produce so much trust,

62
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.870
so there's a maximum weight after which it just won't take off.

63
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.660
If you add too much weight,
it won't lift off,

64
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.360
so you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tax.

65
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.730
This is the tyranny of the rocket equation and it means space flight will never

66
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.820
become easy,
but wait,
it gets worse.

67
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.670
Getting into space is still not good enough.

68
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.870
You're still inside the gravity prison at the age of space and we'll crash back

69
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.704
to earth.

70
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920
Staying in space is much harder than guessing that to get to a stable position

71
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:41.320
where it can stay for a while,
the rocket has to reach low earth orbit.

72
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.620
To do this,
you need a lot of kinetic energy,

73
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.990
which means going extremely fast at an altitude of about 100 kilometers.

74
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.640
This is eight kilometers per second,
28,000 kilometers per hour.

75
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.290
Fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes.
Here.

76
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.640
We can use a trick.
Instead of flying straight up,
we can go sideways.

77
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.710
Earth is a sphere,
so if you're going sideways fast enough,

78
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.580
even though you're falling towards earth,
the ground,
we'll cover way beneath you.

79
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.660
So as long as you're above the atmosphere about 100 kilometers up,

80
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.120
you'll be able to stay up there in orbit.

81
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.320
This is what the ISS does falling around Earth,

82
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.650
expanding energy from time to time to stay fast enough.

83
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.350
If we look at Orbitz in scale,

84
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.970
we see that narrow earth orbit is laughably close to Earth.
To deploy,

85
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:34.601
for example,

86
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:39.100
satellites or need for other planets requires another round of energy debt

87
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.963
repayment.

88
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.830
Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of space line for us right now.

89
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.770
For example,
if we want to send a rocket to Mars,

90
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.570
half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit and the other half for the

91
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.760
55 million kilometers to Mars.

92
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.770
Therefore to be as effective as possible.

93
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.150
Rockets aren't built in one giant piece.
Instead,
we use multistage rockets.

94
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.050
You don't need to carry an empty fuel tank,
so rockets drop it.

95
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.880
Rockets today said their boosters and main stage as they ascend with each

96
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.350
successive stage being its own fully contained,

97
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.270
Rocky's complete with its own engine and fuel.
Okay,

98
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.670
so this is why getting to space is hard.

99
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.900
If you feel all of this seems really complicated,
don't worry.

100
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.450
It's literally rocket science.

101
