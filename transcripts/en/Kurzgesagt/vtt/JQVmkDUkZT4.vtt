1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
Yeah,

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 1>thank you.
You'll buddy.
Well,
kind of right,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.660
but is there a line where this stops being true?

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.610
<v 2>How much of yourself can you remove before you stopped being you and does the</v>

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.080
question even makes sense?

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.290
You'll physical existence is cells,

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
trillions of them at least 10 times more than there are stars in the Milky Way.

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.930
A cell is a living being a machine made of up to 50,000 different proteins.

9
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.400
It has no consciousness,
no,
well no purpose.
It just is,

10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.330
but it is still an individual.
Together.

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.780
Your cells form a huge structures for jobs like preparing food,

12
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.870
gathering resources,
transporting stuff around,

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.120
scanning the environment and so on.

14
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.650
If you extract cells from your body and put them in the right environment,

15
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.860
they will continue to stay alive for a while so your cells can exist without

16
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.350
you,
but you can't exist without them.

17
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.500
If we take all the cells away,
there is no you anymore.

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being new?

19
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.960
For example,
if you donate an organ,

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.530
billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.170
Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person or is this

22
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:36.171
other body keeping a part of you alive or let us imagine an experiment.

23
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
You and a random person from the street exchange cells,
one at a time,

24
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
your body gets to one of our cells.
That body gets one of your cells.

25
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
At which point would they become you?
Would they ever,

26
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.280
or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you?

27
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.070
Let's make this more complicated.

28
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.640
The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

29
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime and 250 million have

30
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.620
died since the beginning of this video alone between one and 3 million per

31
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.920
second.
In a seven year period,

32
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.400
most of your cells are a paste at least once.

33
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.140
Every time yourself set up changes,
you are slightly different than before.

34
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.260
So the part of you is dying constantly.

35
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.840
If you are lucky enough to become old,

36
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.590
you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

37
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.420
So what you consider yourself as ready,
just a snapshot,

38
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.500
but sometimes sells a broken and don't want to die.

39
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.090
Questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies.
We call them cancer.

40
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.280
They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal.

41
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.220
Cancer is not an outside invader.

42
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.370
It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours,

43
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.760
but you could also argue that a cancer cell,
another entity inside us,

44
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.680
another big that just wants to thrive and survive.
Can we blame it for that?

45
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.280
A chilling sell story is that of Henrietta lacks.

46
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.660
A young cancer patient who died in 1951 usually sells,

47
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.640
only survived for a few days in the lab making research a very hard Henrietta's.

48
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.370
Cancer cells were immortal over the decades.

49
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.780
They were multiplied over and over again and use countless research projects,

50
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.520
saving countless lives.

51
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.560
Henrietta's cells are still alive and overall have been grown to at least 20

52
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.700
tons of biomass.

53
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.110
So there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered

54
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.040
dead for decades.
How much of Henrietta is in the cells?

55
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
What makes one of your cells you anyway?
Maybe the information contained in it,

56
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.110
your DNA.

57
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.430
Until recently it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the

58
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.630
same genetic code,
but it turns out this is wrong.

59
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.060
You'll genome is mobile changing over time through mutations and environmental

60
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.270
influences.
This is especially the case in your brain.

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.280
According to recent discoveries,

62
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.200
a single neuron and an adult brain has more than 1000 mutations in its genetic

63
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.720
code that are not present in the cells surrounding it,

64
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.420
but how much you is your DNA.

65
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:24.421
Really about 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our

66
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.650
ancestors and merged with us.

67
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.900
Mitochondria power plants at the cell once were bacteria that most with the

68
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.950
ancestors of your cells,
they still have their own DNA.

69
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.040
An average cell has hundreds of them,

70
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.510
hundreds of little things that are not really human,
but they still kind of,
ah,

71
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.380
this is confusing.
Let's backtrack a bit.

72
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.390
We know that you're made up of trillions of little things made from more little

73
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.970
things.
There's a constantly changing together.

74
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.130
All those little things are not static,

75
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.570
but dynamic composition and condition is changing constantly.

76
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.260
So we might just be a self sustaining pattern without clear borders that gained

77
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.380
self awareness at some point and now has the ability to think about itself

78
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:16.120
through time and space,
but ready only exists in this exact very moment.

79
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.300
Where did this pattern start with your conception?
When the first human arose,

80
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.720
when life first began conquering our small planet,

81
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.530
when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star,

82
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.130
our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes.

83
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.180
The fuzzy borders that make up Rhianna's e are hard to grasp.

84
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.740
Maybe ideas like beginning and end life and death.

85
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.130
You and me are really not absolute,

86
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.920
but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern,

87
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.750
a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe.

88
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.150
<v 3>Okay?</v>

89
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.460
<v 2>The problem of who we are isn't just a question of ourselves,</v>

90
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.290
but it's also a question of our minds just as our cells can be divided and

91
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.220
separated from us.

92
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.370
So can our very brains be divided and separated from us while still in the

93
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.310
skull?

Okay,
so now go watch CGP grades video.

If you're not yet subscribing to his channel,
you should really change that.
