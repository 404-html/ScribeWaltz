1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.180
Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.270
Unfortunately the universe will die.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.020
It will happen slowly over many billions of years,

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.530
but it will happen on a universal timescale.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.160
Stars like our Sun will be gone in no time.
Luckily,

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210
there are places that will exist practically forever.
From a human perspective,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.650
the corpse is of dead stars,
white dwarves.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.260
They could be.
Humanity is lost home right before the death of the universe.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
What are these strange things and what happens when they finally die?

10
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.850
How Long Stars live varies drastically depending on how massive they are.

11
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.470
For example,

12
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.470
really massive stars burn hot and fast dying violently in Supernova a few

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.960
million years after birth,
but they're the exception.

14
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.850
97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs.

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.050
There are two ways this can happen.
Small stars,

16
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.160
so called a red dwarfs burnout over trillions of years until they eventually

17
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:22.161
quietly turn into white toffs medium size stars like our sun are more

18
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.094
interesting.

19
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290
Imagine the sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium and

20
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.580
it's called through its gravity.

21
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.830
The fusion of relevance releases extreme amounts of energy that pushes outwards

22
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:39.660
and stabilizes the star.
Keeping it in a delicate balance.
When the sun is old,

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.220
the hydrogen and the core is exhausted and the sun will begin to burn helium and

24
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:48.570
to heavier elements while doing so,
it will shat its outer layers.

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.730
When this process is over,

26
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
more than half of the sun's mass will be lost into space as a spectacular

27
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.780
planetary Nebula,
millions of kilometers to cross.

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.440
What remains will be its former core oh white 12 is born a star corpse.

29
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.490
What its former self was about 100 times its diameter.

30
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.200
Now it's only about as big as earth,
but still with about half of its format.

31
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.920
This means it's extremely dense.

32
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.410
A teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car it surface.

33
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:25.620
Gravity is over 100,000 times higher than us.

34
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.950
If you tried to land on it,

35
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.770
you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle.

36
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.590
Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely,
but possible.

37
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.330
Most of them that exist.
Now we're former stars that Welch died,

38
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.500
which probably ruined any panics they once hat,
but that's not all.

39
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.180
Since they are so small,

40
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.620
a planet would need to orbit them about 75 times closer than earth is to the sun

41
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.240
to have liquid water.
There's proximity has up and downsides.

42
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.650
For one,
it would tidally locked the punish,

43
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.140
giving it a permanent day and permanent night

44
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.750
at the edges of these day and night zones.
Life could be possible,

45
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.320
but white dwarves have a very stable energy output,

46
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.530
so they might actually be safer to live around them.
Many red dwarfs.

47
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.020
This is still speculation at this point,

48
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.560
but if we could find a white wolf with the right conditions to settle around,

49
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.080
we could have a home for many billions of years,

50
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.550
but why do they shine so much longer than other star types?

51
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.790
White dwarfs are very,
very hot,

52
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.050
up to 40 times hotter than our sun ranking among the hottest objects in the

53
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.780
universe that they are not incredibly active.

54
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.140
All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go.

55
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.020
Only on its outer layer can escape into space,

56
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.940
but space is mostly empty so he'd can't be transferred by conduction.

57
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.420
The only way energy can escape is by radiation.

58
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.840
This is so inefficient that white dwarves.

59
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.340
We'll take trillions of years to cool down which may make them humanity's last

60
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.174
refuge.

61
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.530
They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe.

62
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.570
According to some estimates,
white dwarves might shine as long as 100 billion,

63
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.680
billion years,

64
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.930
10 billion times longer than the universe has existed so far into the future

65
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.300
that no regular stars will sign any anymore.

66
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.110
Galaxies will have evaporated and only then will the first white dwarf turn into

67
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.120
the first black dwarf.
When this happens,

68
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.360
the last hope for life will die off land offs will be inactive fairs with no

69
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.440
energy left to give still massive enough to kill you.
If you get too close,

70
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.650
so cold that there'll be near the cold is possible.

71
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.600
Temperature in the universe so dark that they are practically invisible.

72
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.130
The universe will enter its last stage heat death,

73
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.640
which we'll leave the universe unrecognizable and absolutely dark and cold

74
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.870
graveyard with a black holes and black dwarves scattered over trillions of light

75
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:06.280
years.
We don't know for sure what will happen with black dogs in the end.

76
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.930
If the Proton,
one of the fundamental parts of atoms has a limited lifespan,

77
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.440
blank dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years.

78
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.870
If the Proton does not decay,

79
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.430
black doors will probably turn into spheres of pure iron via quantum tunneling

80
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.500
over a time span,
so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay.

81
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.690
These irons fairs will then travel completely alone through a dark universe.

82
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.500
Nothing new will happen anymore forever.

83
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.380
While this may sound kind of dark,

84
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.830
this is set far away that for our purposes today,

85
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.630
it might as well not happen at all.
It doesn't matter what happens in a billion,

86
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.710
trillion years right now,
we happen to exist at an excellent time,

87
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.130
able to be an or about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planet

88
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.380
and enough time to visit them.
One day

89
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.110
I'm music is finally available on Spotify and iTunes.

90
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.510
It's composed by our good friends at epic mountain.

91
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.970
Two guys with a studio who make music for a living.

92
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.600
You can check them out here and follow them on Facebook and Twitter,

93
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.260
and if you like our videos,
please consider supporting us on Patriot.

94
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.120
It really would be extremely helpful if you need an excuse to delay work a

95
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.180
little bit longer.
Here's a playlist with more space videos.
