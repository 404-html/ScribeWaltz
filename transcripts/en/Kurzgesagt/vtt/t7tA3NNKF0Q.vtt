00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.020
A few days ago,

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.950
Facebook proudly announced that they had achieved 8 billion video views a day.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.610
That's really impressive until you done that in the first quarter of 2015 725 of

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.310
the thousand most viewed videos on Facebook was stolen,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.280
amassing a total of 17 billion views,

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.860
sites and content aggregators,
steel videos from Youtube to go viral on Facebook.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.070
These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.180
They read their algorithms so that video's uploaded into their player.

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
I'll prefer to youtube links because users should be kept as long as possible on

10
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.260
the site so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.540
This is after all their business model,

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.880
but it also cheats when it comes to views.
A view is counted after three seconds,

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.470
even if the video is muted,
which means that because of auto play,

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.830
if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough,
you count as a viewer.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.390
That means engagement is terrible compared to youtube views.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.500
Facebook views plummet after a few seconds because most of use are not real,

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.410
but large numbers are impressive.
Soap.

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.120
Facebook keeps pretending while this forced of identity is where the real

19
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.360
problem is.
The so called free booting,
the stealing of videos.

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.940
Since Facebook prefers its own player,

21
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.550
stolen videos reach way more people than the original.

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.670
Lately this has happened to us more and more often.

23
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.350
The most recent example of mass,

24
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.490
3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in two days.

25
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.080
While our own post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1000 times,

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.590
other creators are headed even harder,
smarter every day.

27
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:39.000
His videos get sold in constantly getting viewed up to 17 million times,

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.210
but even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson,

29
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.830
a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his

30
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.390
Facebook page.
He adds a link to buy his music too.
He's not alone in this.

31
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.630
A whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other

32
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:59.310
people's work.
This is really bad for independent creators.

33
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.430
Contrary to popular belief stolen content gives,

34
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.410
creates as close to no exposure at all.

35
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.810
Only the thief and Facebook profit from this quality content takes a lot of

36
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:13.080
creativity,
time and love.
In our case,

37
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.260
a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make even weight with more

38
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.080
than a million subscribers aren't dependent on the ads and exposure without ads

39
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.850
and the support of our generous patrons.

40
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.590
We could not make videos for a small creator of viral video can mean the

41
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.950
difference between a career and a hobby.
On Youtube.
There's kind of,

42
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.520
theft is not a problem because they have major safeguards that protect content

43
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.990
from being stolen.
Although the content ID system is far from perfect,

44
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.160
especially for film critics and Gamers.
Facebook,
on the other hand,

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.030
pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the

46
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.130
other,
but things are not fine.

47
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.330
Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last

48
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.163
year.
One,

49
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040
get an email or a tweet from a fan that gives you a direct link to your video.

50
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.380
It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself.

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.870
You depend on luck to find your stolen videos,

52
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.090
to search for Facebook copyright infringement on Google because it's actually

53
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.280
faster this way.
Three,

54
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.410
fill out an annoyingly long contact form for what's the views on your stolen

55
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.400
videos rise.
Five Facebook finally pulls the video.

56
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.563
Conveniently.

57
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
The video has already gained in 99% of all the views that we'll ever get.

58
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.620
The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all.

59
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.970
This is what successful creators have to deal with constantly and on top of

60
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.920
losing out in terms of exposure and money.

61
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.180
It just feels like a violation to be treated like that.
In a recent statement.

62
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.860
Facebook announced they want to change,

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.610
but it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral

64
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.840
video to be taken down and Facebook does not share the profits made from it.

65
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.430
At this point,
Facebook is not a partner.
Creators look forward to working with.

66
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.500
They've built their video empire on stolen content and disregard for original

67
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.460
content creators.

68
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.870
This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars.

69
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.160
Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the

70
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:11.140
uploaders eight cart of the ad revenue,

71
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.100
which with the current state of play is troubling right now.

72
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.670
This is mainly being tested with big media companies,
but as creators,

73
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.180
we don't feel like we're being asked all taken into consideration by the giant

74
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.540
that is Facebook.
What can you as a viewer do to help here?

75
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.910
If you spot stolen content on Facebook,

76
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.160
make a comment linking to the original content.

77
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270
Alert the original creator because only they can file a copyright report,

78
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.840
share this video or the one done by smarter every day.

79
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.100
We all want the same thing,
a free internet that the basis for creativity,

80
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.720
community and great stuff.

81
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.140
We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner instead.

82
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.470
An obstacle to this goal for more in depth information.

83
