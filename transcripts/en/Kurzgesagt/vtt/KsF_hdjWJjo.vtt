1
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.890
So the system,
Allah home in space,

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.180
we live in a peaceful part of the Milky Way.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.510
Our home is the soda system of four and a half billion year old formation that

4
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:23.511
races around the galactic center at 200,000 kilometers per hour and circles it

5
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.750
once every 250 million years.

6
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.700
Our Star,
The sun is at the center of the solar system.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.760
It's orbited by eight planets,

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.660
trillions of asteroids and comets and a few dwarf planets.

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
The eight planets are divided into four planets like ours,
mercury,
Venus,

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
earth and Mars,
and four gas giants,
Jupiter,
Saturn,
Uranus,

11
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.043
and Neptune.

12
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.350
Mercury is the smallest and lightest of all the planets.
Uh,

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.700
mercury year is shorter than a mercury day,

14
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.250
which leads to enormous fluctuations in temperature.

15
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.570
Mercury does not have an atmosphere or a moon.

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.700
Venus is one of the brightest objects in the solar system.

17
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
And by far the hottest planet with atmospheric pressure that is 92 times higher

18
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.724
than on earth.

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.670
An out of control greenhouse effect means that Venus never cools below 437

20
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:26.700
degree Celsius.

21
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.050
Venus also doesn't have a moon.

22
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.290
Earth is our home and the only panel with temperatures that are moderate enough

23
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:41.130
to allow for a surplus of liquid water.
Furthermore,

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.760
it's so far the only place where life is known to exist.

25
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.730
The Earth has one moon.

26
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.480
Mas Is the second smallest planet in the solar system and hardly massive enough

27
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.360
to keep a very thin atmosphere.
It's Olympus.

28
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.830
Mons is the largest mountain in the soda system more than three times as high as

29
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.970
Mount Everest.
Mohs has two small moons.

30
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.390
Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the solar system.

31
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
It consists largely of hydrogen and helium and is the theater for the largest

32
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:22.110
and most powerful storms.
We know
it's largest storm.

33
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.900
The great red spot is three times as large as earth.

34
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.170
Jupiter has 67 moons.

35
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.900
Satin is the second largest plan is and possesses the smallest density of all

36
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.530
the planets.
If you had a sufficiently large bathtub,

37
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.910
satin would swim in it.

38
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.860
Saturn is also known for its extended very visible ring system.

39
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.950
It has 62 moons.

40
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.060
Uranus is the third largest planet and one of the coldest of all the gas giants.

41
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.020
It's also the smallest.

42
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.400
The special thing about Uranus is that it's axes of rotation is tilted sideways.

43
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.600
In contrast to the seven other Palettes,
it has 27 moons.

44
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.480
Neptune is the last planet in the solar system and is similar to uranium.

45
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.060
It's so far removed from the sun.
There's a net you near is 164 earth years long.

46
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.894
Then

47
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.930
the highest wind speed ever measured was in a storm on Neptune at just under

48
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.240
2,100 kilometers per hour.

49
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.560
Nip tune has 14 moons.

50
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.210
If we compare the sizes of the planets,

51
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.940
the differences between them become even clearer.

52
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.230
Jupiter is the leader in terms of size and weight.

53
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.900
Small Mercury on the other hand is even smaller than one of Jupiter's moons.

54
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.830
Gunny meet Jupiter is so massive.
There's a loan.

55
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.540
It contains roughly 70% of the mass of all the other planets and has a massive

56
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.620
impact on its surroundings.
That's a blessing for earth.

57
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.240
Since Jupiter draws most of the dangerously large asteroids that could wipe out

58
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.074
life on earth,

59
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.720
but even Jupiter is a dwarf in comparison to our star.

60
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.160
The Sun calling it massive.
Does Not do justice to the sun.

61
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.750
It makes up 99.86% of the mass in our solar system.

62
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.740
For the most part,
it consists of hydrogen and helium.

63
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.150
Only less than 2% is made up of heavy elements like oxygen or iron.

64
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.450
At its core,
there's some fuses,

65
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.480
620 million tons of hydrogen each second and generates enough energy to satisfy

66
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.280
mankind's needs for years,

67
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.960
but not only the eight planets orbit our son,

68
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.390
trillions of asteroids and comets also circle it.

69
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.050
Most of them are concentrated into two belts,

70
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.750
the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the cup of bell to the edge of

71
00:04:56.751 --> 00:05:01.670
the solar system.
These belts a home to countless objects.
Someone's launches,

72
00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:04.730
a dust particle authors the size of dwarf planets,

73
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.080
the most well known object in the asteroid belt is Sarah's.

74
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.530
The most well known objects in the Khyber Belt aren't Pluto make,

75
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:14.750
make and Haumea?

76
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.770
Usually we described the asteroid belt.

77
00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:23.750
It's a dense collection of bodies that constantly collide,
but in fact,

78
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.100
the asteroids aren't distributed across an area that is so indescribably large

79
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.100
that it's even difficult to see two asteroids at once

80
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.670
despite the billions of objects in them.

81
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.010
The asteroid belts are fairly empty places and nonetheless there are collisions

82
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:44.450
over and over again.
The massive both belts is also unimpressive.

83
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.860
The asteroid belt has a little destined,

84
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.910
4% of our moons mask and the Kuiper of belt is only between one 25th and one

85
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.750
10th of Earth's mass.

86
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.600
One day the soda system will cease to exist.

87
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.910
The son will die and mercury,
Venus and maybe earth too will be destroyed

88
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.630
and 500 million years it will become hotter and hotter until at some point it

89
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.920
will melt Earth's crust.

90
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.060
Then the son will grow and grow and either swallow earth or at least turn it

91
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.350
into a sea of lava.

92
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.530
When it has burnt up all it's fueled and lost most of its mass,

93
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.240
it will shrink to a white dwarf and burn gently for a few billion more years

94
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.090
before it goes out entirely.

95
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.670
Then at the latest life in the solar system will no longer be possible.

96
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.490
The Milky Way will not even notice it.

97
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.290
A small part of it in one of its arms will become just a tiny bit darker,

98
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920
and mankind will cease to exist or leave the solar system in search of a new

99
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.104
home.

100
00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>
