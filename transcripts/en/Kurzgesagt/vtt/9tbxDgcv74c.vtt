00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.570
What would happen if we designate you to humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.780
at the deepest point of the ocean?
For sure.

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.260
So now miss hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
Earthquakes would level countries.
New volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter,

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.030
maybe even earth could be ripped apart or thrown out of orbit.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.423
Wow.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460
Almost currently earth deepest known point is inside the Mariana trench.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.660
The Mariana trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic

9
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.120
plates that looks like an upside down mountain.

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.940
It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers,

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.720
almost at three times deeper than the dark grave of the titanic.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.380
It's one of the last places on earth for humans to explore,

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.370
pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.020
It's a relatively pristine environment,
thanks to the absence of humans.

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.170
A great case for our nuclear task.

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.670
We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded.

17
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840
The rds to 20 hydrogen bomb or Sar Bomba,

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.540
it's explosion was so massive that it's shockwave traveled around the earth

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:17.430
three times and it's mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky.

20
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.070
It's shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything and a thousand square

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.270
kilometers.
It's fireball,

22
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
hot enough to burn the rubble bombs like this release.

23
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.980
It's such an enormous amount of energy at once that they could boil away an

24
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:36.981
entire leg and if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana trench,

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.310
that's exactly what happens.
Let's pull the trigger

26
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.960
and the first few microseconds,

27
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.790
the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50

28
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.320
megatons of TNT.

29
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.670
A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench.

30
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.200
For the first time in history,
the he's of the explosion produces eight cavity,

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.220
a flaming bubble of water vapor,
radioactive nuclei,

32
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.620
and the remains of very unlucky fish.

33
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.300
The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it.

34
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.060
The pressure of the bubble is immense.

35
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.820
Plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way.

36
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.650
Sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around

37
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.280
the world,
and then almost as fast as it emerges,

38
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.240
it stops on the surface of the earth.

39
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.780
This fireball bubble would grow to 10 kilometers.
The second data,

40
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:37.530
it's detonated as the atmosphere batty puts up a fight to hold it back,

41
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.110
but the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana trench is enormous with 11

42
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.400
kilometers of water overhead being in the Mariana trench as link being crushed

43
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.000
by a hydraulic press from every direction here,

44
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.020
a second after the detonation out bubble is about a kilometer across.

45
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.510
When oddly enough,
it starts to shrink.

46
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320
The bubble itself losing pressure as it expands until the water turns it back.

47
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.780
We compressing it.

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.160
The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a

49
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:09.910
few times.

50
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.870
The bubble shrinking and growing until eventually the bubble loses for good.

51
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.210
The pressure around it is too great and turbulent water begins to chop it up.

52
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.590
It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud as it

53
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:28.591
disintegrates into many smaller hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards and

54
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.900
as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface,

55
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.000
it does basically nothing.

56
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.620
Just a small wave and a bubbling plume of radioactive will.

57
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
Water in the Pacific notes to Nami will wash away Japan or California,

58
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.480
although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time.

59
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600
The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days,

60
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.440
although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere

61
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.450
where it collects and then rains down again.

62
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.080
Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines.

63
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.720
The worst event probably happens over the oceans,

64
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.240
but clearly the real danger comes from our explosion triggering earthquakes and

65
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.320
volcanoes,
right?

66
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.970
Even if we designated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where

67
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:17.350
tectonic plates touch,

68
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.670
probably not the explosion would vaporize a part of the sea floor and turned a

69
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:26.380
lot of sand into glass,
but most of the energy goes into the water,

70
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.820
not seismic waves.

71
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.470
Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries and

72
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.970
earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happened a few times a year

73
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.250
without triggering any sort of apocalypse,

74
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.910
but maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit since no masses taken away or added

75
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.060
to the earth,
our orbit is completely unaffected.
Also,

76
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.930
there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years,

77
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.710
and that didn't change our orbis.
So why would this time be different?

78
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.590
The strongest forces humanity can unleash our lovable compared to the forces of

79
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:06.010
nature.
The planet is too big.
It doesn't care.

80
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.140
So what happens to us if we designate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean?

81
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.060
Pretty much nothing.

82
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.210
<v 1>Okay?</v>

83
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.210
<v 0>Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner more than 1000 people</v>

84
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:24.960
have got their own bird.
It helps us explain things.

85
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.700
Clowns around in the background or dies.
Horrible and avoidable death.

86
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.070
If you want your own bird too,
and you want it to appear in one of our videos,

87
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.310
you can get it at patrion.com/courts Cozart Pete.

88
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.320
Sean is one of the main ways we sustain ourselves.

89
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.960
So on top of getting a super nice Avatar,

90
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.500
you also help us make more and better videos.
