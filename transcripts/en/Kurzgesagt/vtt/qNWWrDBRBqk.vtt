1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.290
In the year 10 14 Byzantines emperor basil.

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:09.060
The second is to feed the Bulgarian army and captured 15,000 prisoners.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.240
He could have killed them,
but he had a different idea.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.140
He wanted to weakened as opponents for decades to come.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.120
So he ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be blinded.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.440
The 100th to be spared one eye to guide the rest back home,

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
forcing their communities to care for them for the rest of that lives.
Today,

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.060
humans are subject to an attack.

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.920
Just as cynical as this by our league of supervillains called NTDS.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
One in seven humans on the planet suffers from one or more NTDs,

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.110
more than the entire population of Europe.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
They do unimaginable damage by crippling countless people.

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.390
They destroy billions of dollars in income each year.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.150
We can communities and slow progress.
What are these monsters?

15
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.850
Straight out of a horror movie seeking's a wreak havoc on our species.

16
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.580
NTDS are caused by a vast range of different parasites such as worms,
Amoeba,

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.030
bacteria,
or viruses.
The symptoms they cause,

18
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.480
the justice diverse and Trudy,
the stuff of nightmares,

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.640
some like hookworms compete with children's brains.
And bodies for nutrition,

20
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.460
stunting,
growth and impairing intelligence.

21
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.990
Some NTDs cause blindness as a result of awful eye infections.

22
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
Other parasites can find patients to bed for months and damage internal organs,

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.580
often shortening lifespans drastically,

24
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.960
yet others cause horrible disfigurements that lead to social stigma.

25
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.360
A life lived in shame and unemployment.

26
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.810
There are also a few that are incredibly agonizing.

27
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.580
They cause continuous itching or horrible pain.
In fact,

28
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.790
let's introduce you to one of them are drug can kill Isis.

29
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.180
If you accidentally drink water infected by it,

30
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.360
you won't notice anything for a year until one day you suddenly see a blister on

31
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.960
your leg.
The world breaks out of the skin to release new larvae.

32
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
The only way to remove this is to slowly put it out of your leg,

33
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.350
center by centimeter over the course of several weeks because drug can kill Isis

34
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.090
is now up to a meter long.

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.840
We can all agree that we should kill such parasites with fire.

36
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.210
That's why we declared war on them,

37
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.160
pleading to eradicate most of them by 2020 and we tried doing that very hard.

38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.790
In 1985 there were 3.5 million cases of [inaudible] is all over the world.

39
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.670
In 2015 there were 22 we killed 99.999% of these little monsters.

40
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.580
It will be the first parasite we eradicate for good very soon.

41
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.020
So even if they don't generate a big like about it is actually amazing.

42
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.240
Things have happened when it comes to NTDs.

43
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.510
All NTDs have one thing in common.

44
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.770
They preferably attack humans who live in the most isolated communities and who

45
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.390
are least able to defend themselves.

46
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.560
There are villages that are 500 kilometers from the nearest health facility with

47
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.310
no roads anywhere.
So even if a remedy is available,

48
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.250
what if it means going on an odyssey to get it to the patients,

49
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
this cold for an attack using brute force to stamp out NTDs once and for all,

50
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.580
what's possibly the biggest medical program in human history?

51
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.581
It was launched unmatched in scale organizations from all fields all working

52
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.520
together right now.
To eliminate 10 of these NTDs forever.

53
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.740
Ironically,
every NTD is in fact preventable or treatable,

54
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.450
but most of them can only be controlled by giving medicine to every person in

55
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.190
all high risk areas.
That means millions and millions of doses of medicine,

56
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.170
often for several NTDs at a time over the course of years in countries where

57
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:03.370
there is no infrastructure,

58
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.260
governments and health organizations just couldn't do that by themselves.

59
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.750
Hair humanity got an opportunity to show off what the industrialized production

60
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.980
of medicine can achieve.

61
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.900
The Pharma industry stepped in to distribute the necessary drugs for free and

62
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.290
promise to keep doing it until those 10 diseases are gone.

63
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.630
By 2020 nearly $18 billion worth of drugs will have been distributed.

64
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.660
The largest drug donation the world has ever seen.

65
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.400
They also helped to make sure the drugs actually get to where they're needed.

66
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.010
In 2015 alone,

67
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.810
these treatments reached over 850 million people more than the population of the

68
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.730
EU and the u s combined

69
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.390
bad things happening generates headlines.

70
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.770
Hundreds of millions of people overcoming extremely destructive diseases in an

71
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.780
unprecedented act of corporation.

72
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.410
Doesn't stories like this one and not told often enough.

73
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.660
Good things happen all the time.

74
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.470
Moving humanity closer to a future with no suffering.

75
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.430

78
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:19.720
each other.
