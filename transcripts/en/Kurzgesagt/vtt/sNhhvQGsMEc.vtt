1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.450
Oh,
we the only living things in the entire universe.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.160
The observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.370
There are at least 100 billion galaxies,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.030
each with 100 to 1000 billion stars.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.660
Recently we've learned the planets are very common to,

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.190
and there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:23.850
universe,

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.340
which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist,

9
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:32.940
right?
But where is it?
Shouldn't the universe be teaming with spaceships?

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.680
Let's take a step back.

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.920
Even if there are alien civilizations and other galaxies,

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.070
there's no way we'll ever know about them.

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.070
Basically everything outside of our direct galactic neighborhood,

14
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.020
the so called local group is pretty much out of our reach forever because of the

15
00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:00.100
expansion of the universe.
Even if we had really fast space ships,

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.170
it would literally take billions of years to reach these places traveling

17
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:10.000
through the emptiest areas in the universe.
So let's focus on the Milky Way.

18
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.790
The Milky Way is our home galaxy.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.710
It consists of up to 400 billion stars.
That's a lot of stars,

20
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.250
roughly 10,000 for every grain of sand on earth.

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.240
There are about 20 billion sunlight stars in the Milky Way,

22
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.380
and estimates suggest that a fifth of them have an earth sized planet in its

23
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:33.310
habitable zone.
The area with conditions that enable life to exist.

24
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.090
If only 0.1% of those planets harbored life,

25
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.770
there would be 1 million planets with life in the Milky Way,
but wait,

26
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.780
there's more.
The Milky Way,
it's about 13 billion years old.
In the beginning,

27
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.440
it would not have been a good piece for life because things exploded a lot,

28
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.660
but after one to 2 billion years,

29
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.040
the first habitable planets were born on earth is only 4 billion years old,

30
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.940
so there have probably been trillions of chances for life to develop on other

31
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:01.990
planets in the past.

32
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.010
If only a single one of them had developed into a space traveling super

33
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:08.260
civilization,
we would have noticed by now.

34
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.060
What would such a civilization look like?
There are three categories.

35
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.430
A type one civilization would be able to access the whole energy available on

36
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.350
its planet.
In case you're wondering,

37
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.470
we're currently around 0.73 on the scale and we should reach type one sometime

38
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.460
in the next couple of hundred years.

39
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.590
Type two would be a civilization capable of harnessing all of the energy of it's

40
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.980
Homestar.
This would require some serious science fiction,

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.790
but it is doable in principle concepts like the Dyson sphere,

42
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.210
a giant complex surrounding the sun would be conceivable.

43
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.550
Time three is a civilization that basically controls its whole galaxy and it's

44
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.900
energy.
An alien race that this advanced would probably be good like to us,

45
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.550
but why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place?

46
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140
If we were to build generation space ships that could sustain a population for

47
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.970
around 1000 years,
we could colonize the whole galaxy into million years.

48
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.260
Sounds like a long time,
but remember the milky way is huge.

49
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.000
So if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy and there

50
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.500
are possibly millions,

51
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.940
if not billions of pallets that sustained knife in the Milky Way and these other

52
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.810
life forms have had considerably more time than we've had then.

53
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.730
Where are all the aliens?

54
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.320
This is the Fermi paradox and nobody has nods to it,

55
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.570
but we do have some ideas,

56
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.790
but let's talk about filters or filter in this context represents a barrier that

57
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:44.770
is really hard for life to overcome or they come in various degrees of scary

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.360
one.
There are great filters and we have passed them.

59
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.740
Maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop than we think.

60
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.450
The process allowing life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out and

61
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.240
the conditions required maybe ready complicated.

62
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.460
Maybe in the past the universe was way more hostile and only recently have

63
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.040
things cooled down to make complex life possible.

64
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.060
This would also mean that we may be unique or at least one of the first,

65
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.120
if not the first civilization in the entire universe to there are great filters

66
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.530
and they are ahead of us.
This one would be ready,
ready,
bad.

67
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.710
Maybe life on our level exists everywhere in the universe,

68
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.090
but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point of point that lies ahead

69
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.930
of us.
For example,
awesome future technology exists,

70
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.540
but when activated,
it destroys the planet.

71
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.130
The last words of every advanced civilization would be this new device will

72
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.000
solve all of our problems once I pushed this button.
If this is true,

73
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.010
then we are closer to the end than the beginning of human existence or maybe

74
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.750
there is an ancient type three civilizations that monitors the universe and once

75
00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.280
a civilization is advanced enough,
it gets eliminated in an instant.

76
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.020
Maybe there is something out there that it will be better not to discover.

77
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.710
There is no way for us to know one final thought.

78
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.320
Maybe we're alone right now.

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.370
We have no evidence that there's any life besides us.
Nothing.

80
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.320
The universe appears to be empty and debt.
No one's sending us messages,

81
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.360
no one answering our calls.
We may be completely alone,
trapped on a tiny,

82
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:30.250
moist Mudville in an eternal universe.
Does that false scare you?
If it does,

83
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.720
you'll having the correct emotional reaction.
If we let life on this planet die,

84
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.600
perhaps there will be no life left in the universe.

85
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.230
Life will be gone maybe forever.
If this is the case,

86
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.500
we just have to venture to the stars and become the first type three

87
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.640
civilizations to keep the delicate flame of life existing and to spread it until

88
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:52.120
the universe breathes its final breath and vanishes into oblivion.

89
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.470
The Universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone.
