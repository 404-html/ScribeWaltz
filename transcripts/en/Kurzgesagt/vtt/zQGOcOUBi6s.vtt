1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.790
Every second of your life,
you are under attack.
Billions of bacteria,

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:08.070
viruses and fungi are trying to make you their Hobo.
Still.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.390
Our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards and soldiers,

4
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.350
intelligence,
weapons,

5
00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:17.351
factories and communicators to protect you from a well dying for this video.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.330
Let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs,
for example,
kill enemies,

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.770
communicates,
et Cetera,

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.730
and it has 21 different cells and two protein forces.

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.040
These cells have up to four different jobs.
Let's assign them.
Hey,

10
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.900
are the interactions.
Now let's make this understandable.
First of all,

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.860
let's add colors to the jobs.
Now let's illustrate the cells.

12
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.570
The central color represents the main job of the cell while the surrounding ones

13
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.100
represents secondary duties.
Now the immune system looks like this.

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.050
Now the interactions isn't this complexity just awesome.

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.480
For this video,
we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest.

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.600
So what happens in the case of an infection?

17
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.203
<v 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900
<v 0>beautiful day when suddenly oh wild rusty nail or pairs and you catch yourself.</v>

19
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.690
The first barrier of the immune system is breached.

20
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.790
Your skin nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and Auntie your wound.

21
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.470
They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20

22
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:33.110
minutes.
At first they fly under the radar,

23
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.690
but when a certain bacteria population is reached,

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.270
they changed their behavior and start to damage the body.

25
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.040
By changing the environment around them,

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.960
the immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.
The first of all,

27
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.840
your guard cells known as macrophages intervene.

28
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.680
They are huge cells that God every border region of the body,

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.090
most of the time that they alone can suffocate and attack because they can

30
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.160
devour up to 100 intruders each.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.700
They swallow the intruder hole and trap it inside a membrane.

32
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.140
Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed on top of that.

33
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.560
They cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the

34
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:14.480
battlefield,
so fighting becomes easier.
You notice this as a very mild swelling.

35
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.730
When the Metro phages fight for too long,

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.450
they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate

37
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:21.980
location and urgency.

38
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.570
Neutrophils leave their patrol routes in the blood and a move to the
battlefield.

39
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.010
The neutrophils fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process.

40
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.910
On top of that,
they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria.

41
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.770
They are indeed say deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days

42
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.050
to prevent them from causing too much damage.

43
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.390
If this is not enough to stop the invasion,

44
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.710
the brain of the immune system kicks in,
the dendritic cell gets active,

45
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.820
it reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the

46
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.750
enemies.
They ripped them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer.

47
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.960
Now the dendritic cell makes eight decision should they call for antivirus

48
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.070
forces that eradicate with infected body cells or an army of bacteria killers.

49
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.670
In this case,
antibacteria force is unnecessary.

50
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.450
It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day here.

51
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.100
Billions of helper and killer t cells are waiting to be activated when t cells

52
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.120
are born may go through a difficult and complicated training process and only a

53
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.050
quarter survives.

54
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.180
The surviving cells are equipped with a specific setup and the dendritic cell is

55
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.810
on its way looking for a helper t cell with a setup that's just right.

56
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.830
It's looking for a helper t cell.
The combined to the parts of the intruders,

57
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.350
which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane.

58
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
When it finally finds one,
that chain reaction takes place.

59
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.690
The helper t cell is activated.
It quickly duplicates thousands of times,

60
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.320
some become memory t cells that stay in the lymph node and we'll make you

61
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.000
practically immune against this enemy.

62
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.610
Some traveled to the field of battle to how bout,

63
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.630
and the third group goes on to travel to the center that inf note to activate a

64
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.810
very powerful weapons factory like the t cells.

65
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.770
They're born with a specific setup and when a B cell and the t cell with the

66
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:07.840
same setup meet hell breaks loose,

67
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.490
the B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons.

68
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.900
They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast.

69
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.080
Here helper t cells play another important role.

70
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.860
They stimulate the hard working in factories and tell them don't die yet.

71
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.630
We still need you keep going.

72
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.320
There's also ensures that the factories diathermy infection is over,

73
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.020
so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself,

74
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.210
but what is produced by the B cells?
You've heard of them.
Of course,
antibodies,

75
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.260
little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific

76
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:42.094
intruder.

77
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.030
There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs.

78
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.350
The helper t cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this

79
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.940
particular invasion.
Millions of them flood the bladder and saturate the body.

80
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.470
Meanwhile,
of the site of infection,
the situation is getting Dyer.

81
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.490
The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body guard and a

82
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:07.150
tech sales fight hard but also die in the process.

83
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.320
Help a t-cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay

84
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.010
alive longer,
but without help.
They can't overwhelm the bacteria.

85
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.800
But now the second line of Defense arrives.

86
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.240
Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disabled lots of the intruders

87
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.760
rendering them helpless or killing them in the process.

88
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.210
They also stunned the bacteria and make them an easy target.

89
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.470
They're back is built to connect to killer cells so they can connect and kill

90
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:33.640
the enemy more easily.

91
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.440
Macrophages are especially good at numbing up the bacteria which antibodies have

92
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:42.400
attached to.
Now the balance shifts in a team effort.

93
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.280
The infection is wiped out.
At this point,

94
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.000
millions of body cells have already died.
No big deal.

95
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.920
The losses are quickly replenished.

96
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.210
Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals,

97
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.370
they commit suicide,
so as to waste any resources,

98
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.030
but some stay behind the memory cells.

99
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.210
If this enemies encountered ever again in the future,

100
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.930
they will be ready for it and probably can it before you even notice.

101
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.281
This was a very,

102
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.730
very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work.

103
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.810
Can you imagine how complex his system is even at this level?

104
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.240
When we ignore so many players and all the chemistry,

105
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.410
life is awfully complicated,
but if we take the time to understand it,

106
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.530
we always encounter endless wonders and great beauty.
