00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.323
Makes Sense,

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.580
<v 1>but when you look at huge stretches of time,</v>

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.820
it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.800
So let's start small with minutes,
hours,
days.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.910
You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working and you

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:25.250
probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet.

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.870
Days become weeks,
weeks become months and that we have a year.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.550
Let's look at 2017 France started to train eagles to hunt terrorists,

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.220
drones,

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.210
a check nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern and

11
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.230
people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach.
You know,

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.350
the usual stuff.
Let's go back further.

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.840
A kid born in the first year of the 21st century is 18 years old now,

14
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.380
but the century is still young,
even if you're not.

15
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.020
It was largely shaped by the attacks on nine 11 which led to the war in

16
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:07.340
Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq in March,

17
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
2011 the Syrian civil war began and is still ongoing after seven years.

18
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.690
Most of us were born in the 20th century,

19
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
which had the two most devastating wars in human history.
And the Cold War.

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.690
For the first time ever,

21
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.740
we could destroy ourselves with a nuclear weapons and we always did,

22
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.290
but we also had a space race and Nafta for the first time.

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.940
The incident was also invented,
which led to memes,

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.730
but also to Facebook and Twitter.
So all in all,

25
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.040
we're not sure if this was a good development.

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.000
The average human lives about 79 years,

27
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.430
which covers a good chunk of recent history.

28
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.200
The oldest living person on earth as currently Seleno Hannah Mitchell,

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.440
who was born in 1896 which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling

30
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.250
Europe than to the current day.
Only 250 years ago,

31
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.050
the industrial revolution turn the world into a progress machine for farmers

32
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:06.140
became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute.

33
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.610
Around this time we started the progress that is causing climate change today,

34
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680
not that long ago.
Actually,

35
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.810
the theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in.

36
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.780
Newton wrote down his theory of gravity.

37
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria,

38
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.050
the 15th century with very eventful Columbus's discovery of America and the fall

39
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.430
of Constantinople.
Mark,

40
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.840
the end of the Middle Ages wall was all the rage in the Middle Ages,

41
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.150
but the number one killer was disease.

42
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.890
The black plague killed every third European in just six years.

43
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.680
Around 2000 years ago,

44
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.450
we set the arbitrary year one of our Canada that most of the world follows
today,

45
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.990
but to a Roman,
the world was already ancient.

46
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.740
The Great Pyramids were 4,500 years ago,
so two a Roman.

47
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.920
The pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today.

48
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.180
So long ago that there was still begging mammoths on earth.

49
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.910
A lot of history happened before that.
Even around 7,000 years ago,

50
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.620
humans began writing things down.
About 12,000 years ago,

51
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.870
human organization exploded.

52
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.880
We built our first temple and around the world,
mankind began farming,

53
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.400
which enabled the rise of larger communities.

54
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.030
Our dominance over planet earth really begins here.

55
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.970
Homo Sapien Sapiens,
the modern human evolved at least 200,000 years ago,

56
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.980
50,000 years ago.

57
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.190
The cognitive revolution expanded our minds and innovation back then we shared

58
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.330
earth with at least five other human species.

59
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.850
The dye that died out or were killed by us

60
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.930
that these 2 million years ago,
Aaron says,

61
00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.931
is already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone and 6

62
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.490
million years ago,
the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed.

63
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.030
So this graph is all of human history.

64
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.670
Our close relative homo erectus survived a 10 times longer than we have existed.

65
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.300
This tiny part is the human error.

66
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.490
We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime still.

67
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.960
All of human history is not that long.
65 million years ago,

68
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.380
the age of the dinosaurs and did an in an enormous explosion.

69
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.950
The dinosaurs ruled the earth for over 165 million years,

70
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.780
27 times.

71
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:45.781
As long as it all humans that's so long that it means a t rex that lived at 65

72
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.460
million years ago is closer to us today than two alive stegosaurus

73
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.770
dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today

74
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.960
and all life on this kinase started to 600 million years ago.

75
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300
The earliest animals were fish and other small,
simple sea creatures that came,

76
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.860
insects that reptiles and finally around 200 million years ago,

77
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.300
mammals join the party.
Life itself began much further back.

78
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.810
There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 billion years ago for at least at

79
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:26.530
3.5 billion years.
Life consisted only of single celled organisms.

80
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.070
4.5 billion years ago.
The son was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud,

81
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.290
60 million years later.
Earth fault in those early years,

82
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.220
frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the earth with large

83
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:45.040
oceans.
But as far as the whole universe goes,

84
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.230
how soda system is pretty new.

85
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.820
13.7 5 billion years ago,

86
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.140
the universe was born and about half a billion years later,

87
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.360
our own got x.
He phoned from billions of stars,

88
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.690
but what came before the Big Bang?

89
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.350
The truth is we don't know and maybe we never will,

90
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.320
and there you have it.
The past.

91
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.920
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future.

92
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.170
In roughly 1 billion years,

93
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.710
the sun will be so hot that life on earth becomes impossible.

94
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.450
The death of the son,

95
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.050
4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system.

96
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.080
If we want to have a chance to survive,

97
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.180
we need to have ventured to the stars and what happens after that?

98
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.320
In the next 100 billion years,
most of the bigger stars around will die.

99
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.590
The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer illuminated only by smaller red and white

100
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.424
dwarfs,

101
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.130
but they too will eventually burn out and one day the last star in the universe

102
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:49.964
will die.

103
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.630
The universe will turn dark and at some point even black holes will evaporate

104
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:57.800
and dying.
When they do,

105
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.040
our universe will reach its final stage heat death.

106
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.110
Nothing changes anymore.
The Universe is dead forever.

107
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.230
Now you'll feeling some pretty weird fittings right now,
aren't you?
We are too.

108
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.270
It's only natural.
The good news is this is all far,
far away.

109
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.200
The only time that actually matters is now that cute girl or boy you like ask

110
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:28.310
them out.
Time is precious.
Make it count.

111
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.820
One of the questions we get asked the most is how we make animated videos.

112
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.360
The short answer is with Adobe after effects and years of training,

113
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.780
but if you'd like to get a glimpse,
we now have something for you.

114
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.120
We made skillshare tutorials explaining in detail how we animate scenes from our

115
00:07:51.121 --> 00:07:54.420
videos.
If you aren't already familiar with this,

116
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.320
skillshare is an online learning community with more than 18,000 classes and

117
00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.930
things like writing animation and video editing.

118
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.620
Their premium membership gives you unlimited access to high.

119
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:08.070
He called us he classes from professionals working in their fields so you can

120
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:12.450
improve your skills,
unlock new opportunities and do work that you really enjoy.

121
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.610
It's also extremely affordable.
The annual subscription is less than $10 a month.

122
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.380
The first 1000 people to sign up get their first two months for only 99 cents.

123
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.820
So if you want to learn new things and support courts cause angst,
give it a try.

124
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.580
How did you like this remake?

125
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.570
We're thinking about redoing a few of our older videos in the next one or two

126
00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:36.720
years.
Any videos you would like to see redone.
