1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.130
Violence and wool,
the insane group,
Tennessee.
If ics continues,

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.720
the Russians are invading Ukraine and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to

3
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.600
slug it out.
Does that make you feel gloomy?

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.060
Well died because if you look at the numbers more actually seems to be going out

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.750
of fashion while the global population is as an all time high.

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.680
It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.630
How is this possible?

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.000
As of September,

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210
2014 there were four conflicts going on in the world that had caused at least

10
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.120
10,000 people to die since January,

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
2013 nine conflicts that killed more than 1000 people and 13 that killed more

12
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.880
than 100 since January,
2013 not really peaceful,

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.760
but consider this of all the conflicts going on,

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.490
none is an active war between countries.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.730
They are either civil wars or local conflicts.

16
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.420
Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering,

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.740
their impact is usually way smaller than a war between nations or empires.

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.540
When two nations engage in war,
they can mobilize much bigger forces,

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.870
have access to all of the state's resources and logistics and almost to all of

20
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.810
the population.

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.220
So why have we transitioned from wars between nation states,

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
two civil wars and loads of it is to do with colonialism and the Cold War.

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.570
When the Cold War ended,
a major driver of armed conflict vanish too.

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.850
But the breakup of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions and

25
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.830
brought new conflicts in the now freed states,
which often resulted in civil war.

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.720
Much more importantly,
in 1945 90 all of Africa,

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.930
much of Asia and parts of Latin America were under colonial rule by 1990 all but

28
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.230
a few islands were independent,
but wait,

29
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.160
couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the

30
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.390
third world is just as bad as colonialism?
Let's look at Congo.

31
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgian king an area 80 times the

32
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.110
size of Belgium.

33
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.700
Violence committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of

34
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.701
economic exploitation had killed about half of the population by 1908 about 10

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.570
million Congolese were executed all staff to death.

36
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.510
Millions were mutilated and traumatized.

37
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
The economic exploitation of the Congo remains the top priority and forced labor

38
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:41.511
never really ceased completely until the end of Belgian role in 1960 which is

39
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.680
not really that long ago,

40
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.430
so no colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today and it ended

41
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:51.540
just two generations ago.

42
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.700
Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago

43
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.410
we're under foreign control,

44
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.140
but things aren't getting better until 1989 victory for one side in the civil

45
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.550
war was common.
While nowadays,
victories are much rarer.
At the same time,

46
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
negotiated endings of jumped from 10% to almost 40% what about the rest of the

47
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.640
world?
Why have nation states stopped attacking each other?

48
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.900
There are four major reasons.
One democratization,

49
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.490
the steady development from autocracy to democracy.

50
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.630
Democracy is hardly ever find each other of all the state against state wars

51
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.631
fought since 1900 only a minority were fought between democracies to

52
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.230
globalization.

53
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.740
War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be today.

54
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.880
It's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global markets than to seize

55
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.860
them by force.
People from other nations are more valuable to us alive.

56
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.400
The dead,
which overall is a pretty new concept.

57
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Three war is so 20th century until World War One wolf [inaudible] was seen as an

58
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.310
inevitable part of the human experience and as a valuable tool which you could

59
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.130
use to achieve goals.
When diplomacy hit a brick wall.

60
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.140
Today we have rules that declared acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that

61
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:22.141
armed forces only justified in self defense or with the authority of the UN

62
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.330
Security Council.
These rules are still broken,

63
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.740
but today it's harder to do so without sparking opposition and disapproval.

64
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.150
Also,
we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague,

65
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.390
and that's a very recent innovation for borders are mostly fixed now after World

66
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.300
War II.
Territorial wars with Germany start when most countries pledged to accept

67
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.600
international borders and respect to other nations autonomy.

68
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.250
But is all of this just an anomaly or are we on the road to lasting peace?

69
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.350
Truth is we don't know yet.

70
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.440
We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average,

71
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.780
which is about one or two big wars per century.

72
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.830
We just haven't had enough time since world war two to rule out the possibility

73
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:10.780
that war is not going away.
If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years,

74
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.020
we can be really confident that humanity is changing.

75
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.860
So you see war might be over.
Yes,

76
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.110
there are nasty conflicts going on in many places,

77
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.190
but overall things are getting better and we can make them even better by

78
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.290
speaking up for peace and democracy.

79
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>
