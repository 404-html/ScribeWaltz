1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.290
Humans dream about needing us and traveling through the galaxy,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.800
but we were born too early to be part of it or where are we?

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
The reality is we could begin our dream by building a moon base.
Today.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.410
We actually do have the technology and current estimates from NASA and the

5
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.411
private sector say it could be done for 20 to $40 billion spread out over about

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.950
a decade.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.270
The price is comparable to the international space station or the budget surplus

8
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.410
of Germany in 2017 not that big an investment.

9
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.470
Really the payoff would be a measurable.

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
The moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited

11
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.674
resources.

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out into

13
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:50.070
the solar system and beyond.

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.770
It would create a vast array of new technologies to benefit us on earth and we

15
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.750
would all be part of it.
So why are we doing as well?
Sadly,

16
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.620
it's hard to get governments interested in longterm investments in the future of

17
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:08.430
humanity.
Let's imagine just doing it.

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.480
If we start today,
how would we build a moon base

19
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.730
throughout history?

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
Colonization happened in phases in the first phase of the age of exploration of

21
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.510
the new world.
For example,

22
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.370
European monarchs funded expeditions to chart and discover and to stake their

23
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.340
claims.
They planted a flag and set up a camp,

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.180
but they didn't stay in the second phase.

25
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
Small missions set up outposts and settlements are founded,

26
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.160
which was still very dependent on their home countries for supplies,
some failed,

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400
but others survived and established a permanent presence only then in the third

28
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.550
phase did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate,

29
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.300
creating new wealth and opportunities for themselves and their families,

30
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.330
sending extreme wealth back to their countries of origin.

31
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.750
When we colonize the moon,

32
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.550
we'll go through the same three phases this time without murdering millions of

33
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.960
innocent people in the process.

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.040
The moon is not a welcoming place for living things.

35
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.520
A Moon Day lasts 29 earth days with a difference of navy 300 degrees Celsius

36
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.390
between sunlight and shade.

37
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.190
There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites,

38
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.650
big and small or cosmic radiation.
We're still,

39
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.370
the lunar surface is covered in a layer of nasty Jagat dust.

40
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.510
The moon is hard,
but we're good at doing hard things.

41
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
In the first phase of Luna colonization,
our explorer has proved it can be done,

42
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.470
that a new world can be reached.

43
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.120
This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions.
Since then,

44
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.840
satellites like the American lunar reconnaissance orbiter have mapped the moon.

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.920
While rivers,
like the Chinese Youtube,

46
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.550
have studied the composition of the lunar surface looking for water,
ice,

47
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.030
and metals.
Phase one is more or less complete.

48
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.560
We know what we need to know to enter phase two in the second phase.

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.850
Astronauts,
we'll build the first moon base and this could begin today.

50
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.690
The first small noon base could be completed in a decade.

51
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.460
The first nation that establishes their space will be akin to the first nations

52
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.310
building outposts in the new world 500 years ago.

53
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.940
It's expensive to send rockets to the moon,

54
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.490
so we will send as little as possible.

55
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.200
The base will be light little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more

56
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:41.620
than 12 and we'll be deployed somewhere with a natural shelter.

57
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.780
Options include caves like underground lava tube tunnels or craters near the

58
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:48.970
Poles where the days or six months long,

59
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.150
these astronauts will not stay long.

60
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.710
The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions as solar panels cannot

61
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.900
generate electricity during the lunar night,

62
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.830
but they'll do the groundwork to enable humans to stay permanently.

63
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.630
Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the

64
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.090
composition of the moon and who's experiments.

65
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.970
We'll explore ways of using the available Duna material,

66
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.120
say purifying the lunar ice and turning it into water for human use and water is

67
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.350
important for far more than drinking.

68
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.770
They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food.

69
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.160
Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night.

70
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.030
Extending astronauts stays,
and most importantly,

71
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.900
it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen rocket fuel.

72
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.260
By harvesting water from the moon and putting it into orbit,

73
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.950
the moon base will supply an orbital depot where scientific missions to Mars and

74
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.030
the outer solar system can refuel.
Compared to the earth,

75
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.960
it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the mood into orbit.

76
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.400
Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the moon,

77
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.190
but this isn't a true colony.
No.
Yes,
the base will be abandoned.

78
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:07.030
Their funding stops.
If we want our base to grow into the third phase,

79
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.350
into a true colony,

80
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.030
it must become self sufficient supporting itself via exports to Earth.

81
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.580
Now,

82
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.750
private contractors arrive looking to get rich off lunar resources and support

83
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:23.260
services.
If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space.

84
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.090
What else can they get rich on?
They could extract precious metals,

85
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.290
abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith.

86
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.540
One promising possibility is the mining of helium three and isotope that could

87
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.880
one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors.

88
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.780
Something the Chinese lunar exploration program is currently looking into

89
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.820
future colonists may export helium three back to earth,

90
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.640
providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy.

91
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.500
Asteroids could be pulled into the moon's always and mind.

92
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.040
With commercial exports to Earth,

93
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.420
the colony is fully in it's third phase self sufficient and economically

94
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.254
productive.

95
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.240
Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to

96
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:10.310
continue growing.
Fortunately,

97
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.560
Luna Saul has all the necessary ingredients to make concrete robotic mining

98
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:15.861
rigs.

99
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.090
Consifted the lunar dust for organic molecules and could be used to build huge

100
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.880
structures,
way too massive to be brought from Earth.

101
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.110
While advances in three d printing will make it possible to produce almost

102
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:28.640
everything else the trues need.

103
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.280
It's hard to say when exactly the colony becomes self sustaining.

104
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.710
Growth is gradual.

105
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.180
Experiments are replaced by industry and the population steadily and which is

106
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.860
the hundreds encompassing more than just scientists,
engineers,
pilots,

107
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:49.850
and contractors' representing countries and corporations will be present

108
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.970
to have these people will make a breakthrough,
not scientific,
but social.

109
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.770
They will have the first extra terrestrial child.
Throughout history,

110
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.550
the birth of the first child was celebrated as a moment where the seed of a

111
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.450
colony finally and irreversibly to brute here,

112
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.320
it means that the moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work.

113
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.380
It's a place for people to live,
to raise a family.

114
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.170
Once this transition happens,

115
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.940
the colony grows rapidly building more habitats and schools and farms and all

116
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.770
the things needed to support the growing population.
As our colony grows,

117
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.010
all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it.

118
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.380
They might develop crops that efficiently recycled carbon dioxide or that grow

119
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:37.490
with very little water.

120
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.210
They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of that waste technologies that

121
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:45.110
are extremely valuable for earth.

122
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.840
They could even build the first space innovator in the solar system with a space

123
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:52.970
elevator,
spacecraft,
astronauts,

124
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.170
and raw materials could be bought back and forth from Luna Orbis without needing

125
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:58.370
to use rockets at all.

126
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.710
The moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to

127
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:04.730
imagine right now.

128
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.870
It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point.

129
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.450
We'll the first person born on the moon,

130
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:13.520
take the national identity of their parents,

131
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.780
or will a new generation melt together into a new lunar society.

132
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.170
And when existing treaters,
the bar,

133
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.050
any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten.

134
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.150
Will the colonists be given a saying,

135
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.840
will they declare independence from the earth?
However it happens,

136
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.950
the moon is a perfect sandbox to learn how to colonize the solar system,

137
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.290
the perfect project,
unify nations.

138
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.180
And the only way to guarantee our survival as a species should something tragic

139
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:48.050
happened on earth.
If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way,

140
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.340
we'll have to start somewhere.
So why not start there?

141
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.110
Why not start now?

142
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.300
Unfortunately,
you can jump on a spacecraft and goes to the boon of right now.

143
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480
You can learn more interesting things about space and our universe and we can

144
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:12.810
even help you with that codes because Alta and brilliant are collaborating on a

145
