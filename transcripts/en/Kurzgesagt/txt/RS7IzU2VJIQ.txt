Speaker 1:          00:00          When the gods granted King Midas one wish. He wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was delighted trees, rocks, buildings, all gold. But soon he found in horror that his foods turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone. Humanity got us similar. Wish granted when we learned how to turn Brown, stinky goose into magic, plastic, cheap, sterile and convenient. It changed our lives, but this wonder of technology got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment. It has invaded the animals we eat and now it's finding its way into our bodies, his plastic. For most of our history, humans use stuff we found in nature to build the things we need it. But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago, completely changed our world.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Plastic is made from polymers, long repeating chains of molecule groups and nature. Polymers exist everywhere. The walls of cells, silk hat, insect, carapaces DNA, but it's also possible to create them by breaking down crude all into its components. And rearranging them. We can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits. They are lightweight, durable, and can be molded into almost any shape, not requiring time consuming. Manual work. Plastic can be easily mass produced and it's raw materials are available in vast amounts and incredibly cheaply. And so the golden era of plastics began. Bakelite was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing, electric guitars and cases, acrylic as a shatter resistant alternative to glass and nylon stockings and war equipment. Today almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers, furniture, appliances, houses and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Instead it became trash, coffee cups, plastic bags or stuffed a rapper. Banana. We don't think about this factor. Lot plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately it doesn't sense. Synthetic polymers are so durable. Plastic takes between 501,000 years to break down, but somehow we collectively decided to use this super tough material. The things meant to be thrown away. 40% plastics are used for packaging in the u s packaging makes up one third of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, 335 million tons in 2016 alone, more than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907 piled up in one place that makes a cube with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled, 12% burned, but 79% of it is sticking around.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Still a lot ends up in the ocean around 8 million tons a year. That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050 because it's everywhere. Marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it. In 2015 already, 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic. Many animals, staff with stomach's full of indigestible trash. In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nats, and a drum. While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more widespread in visible form of plastic microplastics. Microplastics are pieces smaller than five millimeters. Some of them are used in cosmetics or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation and crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces. 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.

Speaker 1:          04:51          This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals that are added to plastic. BPA for example, makes plastic bottles transparent, but there's also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. Dehp makes plastics more flexible but may cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if microplastics are toxic because they travel up the food chain. Zero plankton eat micro plastic. Small fish eat zooplankton, so do oysters, crabs and predatory fish and they all land and our plates. Micro plastics have been found in honey, in Cecil and bear in tap water and in the household. Dust around us. Eight out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of fights. A common plastic additive in their bodies and 93% of people have BPA in their urine. There is little sons about this so far, and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more research before panic is justified, but it is safe to say that a lot of happened that we didn't plan for and we have lost control over plastic to assess the extent, which is kind of scary, but just to make sure we should simply band plastics.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Right? Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in other ways. For example, according to a recent study by the Danish government making a single use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to a reusable cotton bag that you need to use your cotton bags 7,100 times before it would have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process of tradeoffs. Everything has an impact somehow and it's hard to find the right balance between the plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment. Globally. One third of all food that's produced is never Eason and ends up rotting away on landfills where it produces me thing and the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging.

Speaker 1:          07:10          It's also important to note where the vast majority of the world's plastic pollution is coming from. Right now, 90% of all plastic waste to entering the ocean through rivers comes from just a 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India, Algeria, or Indonesia industrialized as an impressive pace in the last few decades transforming the lives of billions of people. This development was so fast that the garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste. This broad if politicians in Europe and the U s want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure and developing countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good time with it, but we need to be careful, or just like midas will end up in a world that we didn't wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters. Refused disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same pressure companies and politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together we can beat plastic pollution. This video was a collaboration with UN environment and they're clean seas campaign. If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics, go to clean seas.org and make your pledge.

Speaker 2:          09:00          Okay.
