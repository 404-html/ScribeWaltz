Speaker 1:          00:01          Is the connection between us and the universe. Through light, we can experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself, but what is light

Speaker 1:          00:19          in a nutshell is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported a Futon and elementary particle without a real size. The combi split Oh me created or destroyed light also has a wave particle duality being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time, although this is a lie, so when we say night, we actually mean visible light, which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum energy in form of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation consists of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies. Gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths because they're the highest energy photons, but most gamma rays are just under 10 pick a meters, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom. For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a scent is about as big as a scent compared to the moon. Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum in the range of about 400 nanometers to 700 enemies.

Speaker 1:          01:13          It's about the size of bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter. While the biggest wave lengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than earth. From a physics standpoint, all these different waves are the same. They all have the wave particle duality and travel at sea. The speed of light just at different frequencies. So what makes it visible? Lights especial special then? Well, absolutely nothing. We just happened to have evolved eyes that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is not a complete coincidence though. Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates wet in water, which happens to be where most eyes first evolved millions of years ago. That was a smart move because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us with almost no delay, which is arguably really helpful for survival.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Okay. Where does light come from? A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created. When atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one, they lose energy and a message in the form of radiation at the microscopic level, visible lines is created when an electron within anatomy that is in an excited state, drugs to a lower energy state and losers. This excess energy, the same way incoming light can activate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it. Macroscopically. The moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnet field which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it. These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another, carrying information about its place of creation with why of all the things in the universe is light. The fastest thing there is, let's change the question.

Speaker 1:          03:05          What is the fastest way to travel to space in the universe? It's see exactly 299 million, 792,458 meters per second in a vacuum. 1 billion kilometers per hour. Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast. Any particle that has no massive travels at sea without acceleration or any in between. The light that's being released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches lightspeed at the very instant of its creation. It speed is. See, so why is c or the speed of light finite then? Well, nobody knows. Oh, universities just built this way. We don't have a smart answer here. So light is a part of a spectrum and elementary particle that also behaves like a wave propelled by two perpendicular fields traveling at the speed limit of the universe. Okay, that's nice and all. But what about all the crazy stuff about traveling at the speed of light and time, the twin paradox contem stuff and things like that. We have to save them for another video. For now, let's just be happy. There'll be evolved eyes that pickup waves of information permeating the universe, making a c things that help us to put our existence into perspective.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Okay.
