Speaker 1:          00:01          If you saw a worm hole in reality it would appear round spherical, a bit like a black hole light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a far away place once crossed, the other side comes for the interview with your old home. Now receding into that shimmering spherical window, but our wormholes real or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths? If they are real, how do they work and where can we find them? For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple. A big flat stage where the events are the universe unfold. Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left that's empty. Stage is space and it exists unchanging and eternal. Einstein's theory of relativity change that. It says that space and time makeup that stage together and they aren't the same everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:10          The things on the stage can affect the stage itself. Stretching and warping it. If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood Einstein stage is more like a water bed. This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible. Let's see what that would look like in two d. Our universe is like a big flat sheet bent in just the right way. Wormholes could connect to very, very distant spots with a short bridge that you could cross almost instantaneously enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light. So where can we find a wormhole presently only on paper? General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist. General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality, but they are theoretically possible. And there are different kinds.

Speaker 1:          02:16          The first kind of wormholes to be theorized where Einstein, Rosen bridges, they describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe. Let's try to picture them in two D. Again, empty space time is flat but curved by objects on it. If we compress that objects, spacetime gets more curved around it. Eventually spacetime becomes so walked. But it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole. A one way barrier forms the event horizon, which anything can enter, but nothing can escape trapped forever at the singularity, at its core, but maybe there is no singularity here. One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe. Again, that mirrored upside down. Wet time runs backwards in our universe. Things fall into the black hole in the parallel universe with backwards time. The mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bag. This is called a white hole. Unfortunately, Einstein, Rosen bridges can't actually be crossed. It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite university and they crimped shots in the middle. If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the Whitehall. You'll only become debt, so to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole, a traversable wormhole.

Speaker 1:          03:47          If string theory or one of its variations is the correct description of our universe, then we could be lucky and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already. Shortly after the Big Bang quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales far, far smaller than an atom may have created. Many, many traversable wormholes threaded through them. Our strings called cosmic strings in the first billionth of a trillionth of a second. After the Big Bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny worm holes, we'll pull the my chair's apart, scattering them through the universe. F wormholes were made in the early universe, whether with cosmic strings or some other way, they could be all over just waiting to be discovered. One might even be closer than we realize from the outside. Black holes and wormholes can look very similar. Leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes.

Speaker 1:          04:47          It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out though, but that's okay. There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a worm hole. We could try to make one to be traversable and useful. There are a few properties we want a wormhole to have. First, it must obviously connects to distant parts of space time like your bedroom and the bathroom or earth and Jupiter. Second, it should not contain any event horizons which would blog two way travel. Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational force is don't kill human travelers. The biggest problem we have to solve is keeping our worm holes open. No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them. Gravity wants to pinch it close and cut the bridge. Leaving. Oh need black holes at the ends.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Whether it's a traversable worm hole with both hands and hours or a wormhole to another universe, it will try to close unless we have something propping it open for very old string theory worm holes. That's the cosmic strings job for manmade wormholes. We need a new ingredient exotic matter. This isn't anything like we find on earth or even anti matter. It's something totally new and different and exciting with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before. Exotic matter is stuff that has a negative mass, positive mass like people and planets and everything else in the universe is attractive because of gravity, but negative mass would be repulsive. It would push you away. This makes a kind of anti gravity that props open. Our wormholes and exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push spacetime open greater even than the pressure at the centers of neutron stars with exotic matter.

Speaker 1:          06:42          We could weave space time, however we see fit. We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter. The vacuum of space itself, quantum fluctuations in empty space constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles only for them to be at [inaudible] and instant later. The vacuum of space is boiling with them and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect. Similar to the negative mass were looking for. We could use this to stabilize our worm holes. Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together so we'd have to move them around to interesting places. We could start by wiring the Saudi system, leaving one end of each worm hole in orbit around the earth. We could flag others into deep space. The earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization spread over light shares, but only a wormhole away. However, wormholes have a dark site.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Even opening a single worm hole kind of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradox is and violating the causal structure of the universe. Many scientists think that there's not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all. So for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts and on paper in the form of equations. We know you want to know more about universe stuff.
