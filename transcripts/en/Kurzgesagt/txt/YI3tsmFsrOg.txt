Speaker 1:          00:01          A war has been raging for billions of years, cunning trillions every single day. Well, we don't even notice. The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our Panisse. The bacteria phage or Phage for short. A phage is a virus not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up. The head is an icosahedron assault of dice with 20 faces and 30 ages. It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg like fibers. There are more phages on earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria, and they are probably everywhere. Living things exist. Billions are on your hands and your intestines and your eyelids right now, which might make you nervous it since features are responsible for the majority of deaths on earth, but you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day.

Speaker 1:          01:22          But features also have major floors like any other virus. Pleasers need a host to survive and reproduce. They're not much more than genetic material in a hole and they specialize. Usually a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of it's very close relatives. These are its prey. Imagine a Phage eyes like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family. When a phage finds its victim, it connects it's towel fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture the surface in a weird motion. The phages squeezes it's tail and injects its genetic information. Within minutes the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages. They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand new phages. In the final step, they produce an ender license, a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.

Speaker 1:          02:21          The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of calm, it's out all of its insights and dies. New Features are released and begin the cycle anew. In the last few years, bacteria phages have enjoyed the intention of the second Deb DSP beings on earth. Schumann's recently we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies because we're sort of getting desperate. We screwed up in the past. A single cart or set from the wrong puddle could kill you. Bacteria were our phages tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly. But about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature by accident, we found funky that produced a compound that kills bacteria, antibiotics. Suddenly we had a powerful super weapon. Antibiotics was so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters. Only the old and the weakest among us were killed by them. We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes.

Speaker 1:          03:26          We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon, but bacteria are living things that evolve and one by one they started to become immune against our ovens. This continued until we had created what are called super bugs, bacteria, immune to almost everything we have. This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak. By 2050 superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer. The days when a cart or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back in the u s alone more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year, but it turns out that phages our tiny killer virus robots could save us. We could inject them into our bodies to help cure infections. Hold on. How could injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea? Phages are very, very specialized killers of bacteria, so specialized in face that humans are completely immune to them.

Speaker 1:          04:32          We are two different, we encounter billions of phages every day and we just pull nightly, ignore each other. Antibiotics are like a carpet bombing, killing everything. Even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm. Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to wait a minute is if we use phages to kill bacteria when bacteria develop ways of defending themselves. Well, it's more complex than that. Phages evolve too. There has been an arms race between Batman bacteria for billions of years and so far they're doing great. This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing, but even if bacteria were to become immune against how phage we still might be able to win. It turns out that in order to become resistance to even just a few species of phages bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics, we might be able to trap them in a catch 22 this has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left the bacteria pseudomonas Aeruginosa, one of the most feared bacteria infected the man's chest cavity.

Speaker 1:          05:53          They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics and can even survive an alcoholic hand gel. After years of suffering, a few thousand features were directly inserted into his chest cavity. Together with antibiotics, the bacteria were immune to. After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared. Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental and Pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet, but things are finally changing. In 2016 the largest phage clinical trial to date began and phages are getting more and more attention and we better get used to it because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close. It might be a weird concept, but injecting the deadliest being on planet earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives.
