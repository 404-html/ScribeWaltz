Speaker 1:          00:00          Planet Earth is the home of every life form known to us in the universe. It's age is about a third of the age of the universe and admitted it is a thing of beauty. The slightly squash there with a heavy metal core and a lighter surface crust wrapped in a fence. Lever of sweet attar breeze with fast oceans, fertile plains, magnificent mountains, freshwater rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers orbiting a star, which warms us and gives us energy. But how did our hope come into existence and what's it made of? 4.6 billion years ago, earth was created from the remnants of dead stars that collected in a giant dirty gas cloud. The gas cloud became denser in its center and formed the accretion desk. Small particles started clumping together and building larger and larger objects until they formed the objects we call planets. Today. This process took 10 to 20 million years and is still not very well understood that about this time when the solar system was young and chaotic, a giant objects about as big as Mars collided with our home.

Speaker 1:          01:14          The impact was violent and if the object had been more massive, it might have destroyed earth. Material from Earth was smashed out into orbit and formed the moon, which is the biggest satellite in relation to its planet in the solar system. At this time, earth was a hot hell, constantly being hit by asteroids with seas of lava and a toxic atmosphere, but something was about to change drastically. Earth cooled down. Water from the inside of the earth wandered to the surface and rains down on us only to vaporize again. Advocacy clouds, millions of asteroids brought more and more water to our planet. All the water on earth has about this volume compared to earth. Today, the surface of earth is 71% water and 29% land. 97.5% is silane water, while only 2.5% is fresh water. The fresh water is 69% ice and snow, 30% our ground waters and only about 1% make up the remaining groundwater's, but even this small part is mostly frozen.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Only a tiny part of our water is actually lakes and rivers and an even tinier part is bound in living things so gradually the earth cooled down and the surface formed a thin crust, but inside the earth hot rock continue to swell about moving the cross from below and breaking it apart. This process is called plate tectonics and is happening right now. We'll make a whole video about it in the future. For now, let's just say that the crust of Earth consists of separate Joan plates that move around as they meet, they crumble and create mighty mountains or violently plunged back down deeper into earth, creating deep trenches. That's the way the highest place on earth was formed. Mount Everest and the deepest, the Mariana trench. From our perspective, earth's mountains and trenches are mighty in deed, but when you look at the earth in cross section, you can see how tiny they actually are.

Speaker 1:          03:15          The part we stand on is the crust, which is about 50 kilometers thick. Though it can vary between five and 70 kilometers. By the way, the deepest hole ever drilled by man is 12.262 kilometers deep up to the cross, come to the mantle. It's a silicate rocky shell and about 2,900 kilometers thick. The mental consists of the upper mantel and the lower mantle. The upper mantle has different regions too. It's upper part, which is a viscous and carers. The crust is called the lithosphere. After that there comes the asthenosphere which consists of less mobile, mostly solid material. The lower mantle reaches deep down to the outer core of earth. Earth's outer core is a liquid layer of iron and nickel, about 2,266 kilometers thick. Temperatures vary from 4,000 degrees Celsius to 5,700 degrees Celsius and in the center is the inner core. It's mostly solid.

Speaker 1:          04:10          The ball made of an iron nickel alloy with a radius of about 1200 kilometers, 70% the size of the moon, and about the temperature of the surface of the Simon. It is slowly growing as an estimated rate of about one millimeter per year. Now for some perspective, this small layer of crystallized milk products of former molten metal is where we live. Then there's earth's magnetic field. It's an invisible phenomenon. The diverts high energy particles coming from the sun and other sources and knowing for a stable environment with comparatively little radiation impact on earth, but why is it there? Actually, we don't really know a terrible lot about that. We know it has something to do with the core of the earth inside this metal sphere. Large electrical currents flow in complicated patterns. They cause a magnetic field that sort of stabilizes itself according to the laws of electrodynamics.

Speaker 1:          05:05          This entire system is called the dynamo, but don't let us fool you into thinking we have it all figured out. Speaking of breathtaking information, what's about the airy stuff that surrounds us by volume? Dry Air consists mostly of nitrogen, oxygen, Argon, carbon, a variable amount of water vapor and small amounts of other gases. Humans are very dependent on the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The troopers, fair weather, weather is it's 12 kilometers thick on average. Above that is the stratosphere, which is where the ozone layer protects us from. The Sun's most aggressive type of light. Above that is the Mesosphere, the coolest place on earth with an average temperature around minus 85 degrees Celsius. As about 80 kilometers up the thermosphere starts. The transition to space is a fluent one without clear borders, but Schumann's decided that space starts here at about 100 kilometers. Earth stops and space begins though the atmosphere extends a bit further in this region, we find the ion is fair.

Speaker 1:          06:09          The Aurora borealis and the ISS and the outermost layer is the exosphere stretching up to 10,000 kilometers. It merges fluidly without a space where there's no atmosphere at all. The atoms and molecules in this area are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with each other. Okay. Humans in their present form have only been around for 200,000 years. That 0.004% of Earth's history, not non really, and here we are now living in a thin, moist layer on a small wet rock. We call this rug earth. It is the product to the university's deepest workings. The result of the constant process of creation and destruction happening all over the universe all the time, helped by chance the laws of the universe and random events. We are really lucky.
