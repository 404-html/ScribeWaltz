Speaker 1:          00:00          The moons of Mars explained. Mars has two Boone's Phobos and Deimos. They are really tiny. How tiny compared to Mars or our own moon? Pretty tiny, although tiny, is a matter of opinion. There. Surface areas or close to some of the smallest states on earth like Luxembourg and Malta or their Phobos and [inaudible] are in no way lightweight. In reality, their gravitational pull isn't even strong enough to bring them into spherical form, so they look more like huge potatoes than moons. The most popular theory of that origin is that they were once part of the asteroid belt until Jupiter's massive gravity kick them out of it so Mars could catch them.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Phobos orbits Mars as an average distance of 9,400 kilometers. Once every seven and a half hours, it's on a collision course and gets two meters close to Mars every year in 50 to 100 million years. It will either be ripped to pieces by Mars is gravity and be transformed into a beautiful ring or it will crash into Mars. The energy released in this collision would kill everything on the small Panisse. So if there are humans on Mars, by then, they should build very strong bunkers. Smaller diamonds, on the other hand, is slowly escaping Mars. Eventually it will fly off into space and leave a lonely rev planet behind. So in a few hundred million years, Mars will be moonless and on its own, unless it manages to catch itself. Another asteroid.
