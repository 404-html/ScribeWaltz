Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. The 14 moons of Neptune or a strange bunch. Most of them are small potato shaped pieces of ice and rock. Some so far away from Neptune that they need to 29 years to circle Neptune once. Almost all of them are restaurants trapped by Neptune's gravity. 99.5% of all the mass around Neptune is concentrated in Tryson. It's the seventh biggest moon and more massive than all other known moons in the solar system. That house smaller than itself combined. It's surface area is about as big as the mainland of Russia and Australia together. Also, Triton is one of only four objects in the solar system that we know is geologically active. Tryson orbits Neptune in the wrong direction against the rotation of net unit, which is unique and how so to system for an object as big as Triton. We can conclude from this. The Triton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably was a dwarf planet that was forced into submission by knap June when the solar system was younger and more chaotic.

Speaker 1:          01:06          The most popular theory here is the Tryson was once part of a double system. When Neptune migrated to the outer edges of the solar system, it's gravity interfered with a double system and catapulted the other objective to space. While Triton was forced into orbis, this would have disrupted the orbits of other net tune moons rather violently, and would most likely have either pushed them away from Neptune, all let them collide or crash into Neptune. This would explain why Neptune's moons are so dominated by Triton, but this will end one day. Triton is being slowed down by Neptune and eventually it will either crash into it all be ground by Neptune's gravity into a shoe during system similar to assassins. So don't buy real estate on Triton.
