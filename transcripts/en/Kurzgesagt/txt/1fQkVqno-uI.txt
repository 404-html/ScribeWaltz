Speaker 1:          00:00          There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on earth in the observable universe. We know that there might be trillions of planets, so where are all the aliens? This is the family, Tara dogs. If you want to know more about it, watch part one here we look at possible solutions to the family paradox, so will we be destroyed or does a glorious future awaits us?

Speaker 1:          00:30          Space travel is hard over possible. It's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars. Massive amounts of material had to be put into orbit and assembled. A Journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by population big enough to start from scratch and the planet might not be as hospitable as it's seen from afar. It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip. An interstellar invasion might be impossible to put off. Also, consider timing. The universe is a very old on honor. There's been life for at least at 3.6 billion years, intelligent human life for about 250,000 years, but only for about a century. Have we had the technology to communicate over great distances. There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems and existed for millions of years. Let me, might just have missed them. There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds.

Speaker 1:          01:29          99% of all species on earth have died out. It's easy to argue that this will be our feet sooner or later. Intelligent knife may develop, spread over a few systems and die off over and over again, but to galactic civilizations might never meet. So maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the universe to look at the stars and wonder where is everyone? But there is no reason to assume that aliens on my costs or that our logic applies to them. It might just be the town means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated. Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter. You'd keep sending messages, but liberty would answer and you'd feel pretty lonely. Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligence species and will remain. So until we learn to communicate properly and even if we met aliens, we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Imagine the smartest squirrel you can, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it. After all, from the squirrels perspective, a tree is all the day sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive. So she Linds, cutting down whole forests is madness, but we do destroy forests because we hate squirrels. We just want the resources, the squirrels wishes and the squirrels survival are of no concern to us. A type three civilizations in need of resources may treat us in a similar way. They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier. One of the adience might think for a second oh tiny. At Apes, they build really cute concrete structures. Oh well now they're debt before activating warp speed. But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species, it's a far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics and anyway, it will be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon, a self replicating space probe made from nano machines.

Speaker 1:          03:32          They operate on a molecular level incredibly fast and deadly with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant. You only need to give them four instructions. One, find a planet with life to disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts. Three, use the resources to build new space probes for repeat. A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years, but why would you fly in light years to gather resources or commit genocide? The speed of light is actually not very fast. If someone could travel at the speed of light, it would still take 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way once and you'll probably travel way slower. There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires. An interesting concept as the Matryoshka Brighton, a mega structure surrounding a star, a computer of such computing power that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exists in a simulated universe potentially one could experience and it Turnitin of pure ecstasies without ever been bored or sad.

Speaker 1:          04:38          A perfect life. If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to 10 trillion years. Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms if this were an option or these solutions to the family paradox have one problem. We don't know where the borders of technology are. We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it and super technology awaits US granting US immortality, transporting us to other galaxies, elevating us to the level of gods. One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything. She have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter gatherers 500 years ago. We thought we were the center of the universe 200 years ago. We stopped using human neighbor as the main source of energy. 30 years ago, we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements in the galactic timescale. We are embryos. We've come far, but still have a long way to go. The mindset that we are ready are the center of the universe is still strong in humans, so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe, but in the end, there's only one way to find out, right?
