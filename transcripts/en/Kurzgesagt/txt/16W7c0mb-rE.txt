Speaker 1:          00:00          An end is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no. Well, no clan and yet many ants together. A smart an ant colony can construct complex structures. Some colonies keep farms of Funky, others take care of cattle. They can wage war or defend themselves. How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together? This phenomenon is called immersions and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe. In a nutshell. It describes small things forming bigger things that have different properties than the sum of their parts. Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity and immersions is everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Water has a vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up like the concept of wetness, teak, wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness. There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth. Wetness is an emerging property of water, something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules and this is sort of as many things interact under a certain set of rules, creating something above and beyond themselves. It turns out that more is different. This different property is itself a new thing and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process. You can imagine this as layers at stacked upon each other. Every layer made from more complex parts osms four molecules, molecules form proteins. Proteins make up cells, cells make up organs, organs form individuals, individuals form societies, but how can something be more than the sum of its parts?

Speaker 1:          02:05          How do ams formed the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony by following a rule set of the producers order through chaos. For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs. Let's assume that a colonies should have 25% workers, 25% cat acres, 25% soldiers and 25% gatherers and communicate their current job via chemicals. For example, a worker and constantly secretes chemicals that say, I'm a worker. When ants meet other ants, they smashed each other to gather information, telling each other their job and what they are doing. Both keep track of who they met in the past. Now imagine an anteater kills most of the cataracts. If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will staff. Many work arounds need to switch jobs, but how do you tell this to thousands of them? Simple. You don't. Our work around tool still meet her, the smell, other ants, but it will encounter almost new gatherers at all.

Speaker 1:          03:06          It's counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point and then it changes its job. The worker becomes a gatherer. Other ants will do the same until after a while. There are enough gather as again, the balance is restored all by itself. The actions and interactions of an individual are random. You can't plan which, and we'll encounter which other ENT, but the simple set of rules is so elegant that are colonies. Many operations emerged as a consequence on an even more fundamental level, hundreds of millions of complicated molecules interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure of being with vastly different properties than the sum of its dead parts emerges. The smallest unit of life, the cell. We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are. We just know the emerged from things that are not alive. Cells combine and cooperate. They specialize and respond to one another and over time we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system made of trillions of individual stupid things and yet we read, digest and watch youtube videos. How do your cells know what to do? Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart. Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment to collectively create a heartbeat ourselves, exchange chemical information with their neighbors house to see what they're up to and then decide what to do. If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task, it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them. There is no master minds giving commands, just single units communicating with their neighbors and acting according to the feedback they gas. What about our most important part? What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?

Speaker 1:          05:07          Is our consciousness then an immersion property of the cells in our brain, and this question is too big and important. It deserves a video of its own. Some things that emerge are hard to define. You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts. It has neither brain or face, nobody, and yet the colony interacts with the world just like colonies emerge from ans things emerge from humans like nations. What actually is the nation? Is it it's population? Is it its institutions, its symbols like it's flag colors or anthems, the physical things that makes links, cities the territory it occupies. All of these things are fluid. Populations change and replaced. Institutions come and go. Cities can be constructed and abandoned. Borders have changed all the time for most of history and symbols get replaced by new symbols. A nation has no face, no brain, no body on nations, not real.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Then of course they are just like ant colonies. Nations interact with the world. They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline, and they can stop existing, but they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other, but not just nations. All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us, even if we don't intend to. We are constantly creating communities, companies, cities, societies. All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different qualities and abilities than the pretty stupid apes they emerge. Trump, we don't know why any of this happens. We just observe it and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe. It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
