Speaker 1:          00:00          Have you ever been in an argument about nuclear power? We have and we found it frustrating and confusing, so let's try and get to grips with this topic.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16          It all started in the 1940s after the shock and horror of the war and they use of the atomic bomb. Nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful spinoff of the new technology helping the world get back on its feet. Everyone's imagination was running wild wood and electricity become free. Could nuclear power help settle the Antarctic? Would there be nuclear powered cars, planes, or houses? It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away. One thing was setting the future was a tonic. Just a few years later, there was a sort of atomic age hangover. As it turned out, nuclear power was a very complicated and very expensive turning physics into engineering. Was it easy on paper, but hard in real life? Also, private companies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment. Most of them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil. But there were many people who didn't just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age and exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity, the prospect of being independent oil and gas in boards and in some cases a secret desire to possess the atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Nuclear powers at finest hour finally came in the early 1970s when war in the Middle East cause to oil prices to skyrocket worldwide. Now, commercial interest and investment picked up at eight dazzling pace. More than half of all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985 but which type of reactor to build given how many different types there were to choose from. And he surprising underdog candidate won the day. The light water reactor. It wasn't very innovative and it wasn't too popular with scientists, but it had some decisive advantages. It was there, it works and it wasn't terribly expensive. So what doesn't like water? He had to do well. The basic principle is shockingly simple. It heats up water using an artificial chain reaction. Nuclear Fission release is several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could. Really heavy elements on the brink of stability like uranium two three five get bombarded with neutrons.

Speaker 1:          02:26          The neutrons is absorbed, but the result is unstable most of the time. It immediately splits into fast moving laser elements, some additional free neutrons and energy in the form of radiation. The radiation heat to the surrounding water, well, the neutrons repeat the process with other items releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction. Very different from the first destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb in our light water reactor, a moderator is needed to control the neutrons energy. Simple ordinary water does the job, which is very practical since water's used to drive the turbines anyway, the light water reactor became prevalent because it's simple and cheap. However, it's neither the safest, most efficient nor technically elegant nuclear reactor. The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade though. In 1979 the three mile island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a catastrophe when it's core melted.

Speaker 1:          03:24          In 1986 the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened central Europe with a radioactive cloud. And in 2011 the drawn out Fukushima disaster sparks new discussions and concerns while in the 1980s 218 new nuclear power reactors when live their number and nuclear as global share of electricity production has stagnated since the end of the eighties so what's the situation today? Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of the world's energy demand that are about 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries. About 70 new reactors aren't under construction in 2015 most of the men countries, which are growing quickly, all in all, 116 new reactors are planned worldwide. Most new via reactors were built more than 25 years ago with Prezi. Old Technology, more than 80% are various types of light water reactor. Today. Many countries are faced with a choice, the expensive replacement of the aging renters possibly with more efficient but less tested models or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older technology with different cost and environmental impacts.
