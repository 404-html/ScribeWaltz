Speaker 1:          00:00          What would happen if you were to bring a tiny pieces, the sun to Earth? Short answer, you die. Long answer. It depends which piece of the sun. Like most of the matter in the universe, our son is neither solid liquid or gas, but plasma plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely, which creates a glue like substance. So you can imagine our son has an extremely big spherical ocean of very hot glue. The deeper you go the dancer and the wetter the Goo becomes. So let's bring three samples each the size of our house to our lab here on earth and see what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:53          First sample the Chromos fair. The Chromos fat is the atmosphere of the sun. A layer of spouse gas up to 5,000 kilometers deep. That's covered in a forest of plasma spikes. That can be almost as big as earth. It's pretty hot here between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius. But if we brought a solvent vet to earth, we're not really getting our money's worth in the area where we take our sample. The cruise is fair, is over a million times less dense than air, so compared to our atmosphere at sea level, it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to earth. The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode. Our would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT in the process. This creates a high pressure shockwave, which shatters glass, ruptures, air drums, and maybe some internal organs.

Speaker 1:          01:46          If you're standing too close, it could kill you, so you'd better keep your testers. Let's go deeper. The second sample, the photosphere beneath the Chromos fair is the glowing surface of the sun, the fitters fair, which produces the light. We see it's covered in a grade of a million hotspots called granules, each of them about as big as the United States and over 5,000 degrees Celsius. These granules, other tops of convective columns, churning gas, that brings the heat up from the center of the sun to its surface. In these columns, a few hundred kilometers down, we take our second plasma sample. It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on earth, though still much less dense than air. It's heat support says so it won't implode. Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kilograms of TNT that this time has heat for a dazzling instant. This plasma would glow with a million times.

Speaker 1:          02:43          The brightness of the sun seemed from earth instantly lighting fires throughout our lab, but a few milliseconds later, those fires are all that's left. The plasma has cooled to harness gas floating up from the flaming Roy's. What if we go deeper? Third sample, the radius of zone here, the plasma is about 2 million degrees Celsius and so dense and tightly packed. The creates a sort of maze for itself. Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but it has to wonder for hundreds of thousands of years bouncing endlessly from particle to particle until it eventually finds an access. Bringing matter from here to our lab is what experts call a very bad idea. As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon. Our lab was what does the city around it will be destroyed in an instant.

Speaker 1:          03:40          On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout with our lamp destroyed. We can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today. What if we go much, much deeper? Last sample, the core hair in the central 1% of the staff, we find a third of the sun's mass. The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it. In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees, has enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen powering the sun by nuclear fusion in billions of years after the death of the son. This call will remain as a wide off. If we brought a sample of it to earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience. The biggest nuclear weapon ever designated had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT or acute the size of the empire state building. Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 Vaca towns.

Speaker 1:          04:37          This is 4 billion tons of TNT or a cube, 1.3 kilometers high. To give you a sense of scale, this is the cube inside Manhattan. Once the sphere arrives on earth, this super dense matter expands instantly and creates an explosion with the force of, well the sun. If we get the sample in Paris in the morning, the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise, but one that gets brighter and brighter and hotter and hotter until London burns to ashes in a radius of about 300 kilometers around the blast, everything would be birthed. The shock wave would travel around the earth multiple times. Most buildings in central Europe would be flattened. Eardrums would rupture and windows break across the continent. The explosion would be apocalyptic, possibly human civilization ending. If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age. So if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way to control human caused climate change for a few decades. While this is definitely a good thing. All in all we conclude that we should not try to bring the sun to Earth.

Speaker 1:          05:55          We've made a lot of questionable assumptions, this video, but our maths is real. If you're like us and you enjoy using the power of math to calculate absurd ways to destroy stuff, he may be interested in all the other things you can do with maths. For example, you could calculate how to mind mercury for silicon to build a Dyson sphere. Determine how long it will take the sun to burnout or simply do your taxes. But as much as we love explaining these things, the best way to learn anything is by doing it yourself. Brilliant is a problem solving website that teaches you to think like a scientist by guiding you through problems. They take concepts like these and break them up into bite sized nuggets, present clear thinking in each part and then build back up to an interesting conclusion.
