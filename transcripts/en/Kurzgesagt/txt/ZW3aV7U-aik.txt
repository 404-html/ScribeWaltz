Speaker 1:          00:00          Neutron stars are one of the most extreme things in the universe. They're like giant Hassam cause kilometers in diameter. Unbelievably dense and violent, but how can something like this even exist?

Speaker 1:          00:19          The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance its own gravity and the radiation pressure of it's fusion reaction. In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium. Eventually the hydrogen and the core is exhausted. If the star is massive enough, helium is now fused into carbon. The cause of these massive stars become layered like onions as heavier and heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center. Carbon is fused into neon, which leads to oxygen, which leads to silicon. Eventually the fusion reaction hits iron, which cannot fuse into another element. When the fusion stumps, the radiation pressure drops rapidly. The star is no longer in balance and if it's core mass exceeds about 1.4 so the masses, a catastrophic collapse takes place. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000 kilometers a second as it collapses towards the center of the star.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Now. Oh, neither fundamental forces inside an atom are left to fight the gravitational collapse. The quantum mechanical repulsion of electrons is overcome and electrons and protons fuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus. The outer layers of the star are catapulted into space in a violence supernova explosion, so now we have a neutron star. It's masses between one and three sons, but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide and 500,000 times the mass of earth in this tiny ball that's roughly the diameter of Manhattan. It's so dense that one cubic centimeter of neutron star contains the same mass as an iron cube, 700 meters across. That's roughly 1 billion tons. As massive as Mount Everest in a space the size of a sugar cube, neutron star gravity is pretty impressive too. If you were to drop an object from one meter over the surface, it would hit the star in one microsecond and accelerate up to 7.2 million kilometers per hour.

Speaker 1:          02:32          The surface is super flat with irregularities of five millimeters maximum with a super thin atmosphere of hot plasma. The surface temperature is about 1 million Kelvin compared to 5,800 Kelvin for our son. Let's look inside the neutron star. The Christ is extremely hard and is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice with a sea of electrons flowing through them. The closer we get to the the more neutrons and fewer protons we see until there's just an incredibly dense soup of indistinguishable neutrons. The cause of neutron stars are very, very wait. We're not sure what their properties are, but how closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter or some kind of ultra dense quark matter called quark glue on plasma. That doesn't make any sense in the traditional way and can only exist in such an ultra extreme environment. In many ways, a neutron star is similar to a giant atom core.

Speaker 1:          03:33          The most important difference is that Adam, cause I held together by strong interaction and neutron stars by gravity as if all this wasn't extreme enough. Let's take a look at a few other properties. Neutron stars spend very, very fast young ones several times per second, and if there's a poor star nearby to feed the neutron star, it can rotate up to several hundred times per second, like the object Psr j one seven four eight two four four, six and it's bins at approximately 252 million kilometers per hour. This is so fast that the star has a rather strange shape. We call these objects pulse house because they emit a strong radio signal, and the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly a trillion times stronger than the magnetic field of earth. So strong that atoms get bent when they enter it's influence. Okay. I think we got the point across. Neutron stars are so the most extreme, but also some of the coolest objects in the universe. Hopefully we'll one day sends patients to learn more about them and take some neat pictures, but we shouldn't get too close.
