Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Youtube. Have you ever wondered why we only upload one video each month? Well, the answer's really easy. Time and money. It's fun of course, but to make animation videos like this, a ridiculous amount of time is necessary. Writing the script, storyboard, designing all the stuff, recording that aeration animation, sound design, and composing original music. We would love to make more videos, but it's just impossible right now without a time machine. We all have real jobs and do quotes cause our late nights and on the weekends because it's our passion, but we prefer doing it while the sun is shining and make more videos for you guys, but now you can help us make more science and educational content. There's this great new thing called Patrion. Patrion is a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter, but it works on a monthly basis with smaller amounts. If you want, you can support us with a small sum each month and we will spend this time working elsewhere and make more videos.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Depending on the amount you'll get. Core reward like graphics for your smartphone or computer. Our music links in the video description or our record, your voicemail message that says the mailbox of a man called Jimmy, something like that. Even the smallest amounts. Helpful. We really appreciate it. Oh, videos will stay free on youtube forever, so if you don't want to fund us, nothing will change for you. If we get enough money through Patrion, we can invest more time in cuts because I make more than one video every four weeks in the future. Thank you all for your attention. Lots of love. All the fields. Coats cause out.
