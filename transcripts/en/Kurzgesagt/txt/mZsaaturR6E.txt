Speaker 1:          00:01          The fundamental currency of our universe is energy. It lights our homes, grows our food, powers our computers. We can get it lots of ways. Burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms or sunlight striking photo of all tags, but there's a downside to everything. Fossil fuels are extremely toxic. Nuclear waste as well. Nuclear waste, and there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet, and yet the sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy. Is there a way we could build a sun on earth? Can we bottle a star? The Sun shines because of nuclear fusion. In a nutshell, fusion is a thermo nuclear process, meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot, so hot that the atoms are stripped of their electrons making a plasma. When Nuclei and electrons bounce around freely, since nuclei are all positively charged, they repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion, the particles have to be going very, very fast.

Speaker 1:          01:15          In this context, very fast means that very hot, millions of degrees stars cheat to reach these temperatures. They are so massive that the pressure in there, because that generates the heats to squeeze the nuclei together until they merge and fuse creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process. It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness in a new generation of powerplant the fusion reactor on earth. It's not feasible to use this, a brute force method to create fusion. So if we wanted to build a react to that generates energy from fusion, we have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse. The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors such as the ite, our reactor in France use super conducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium to within a few degrees of absolute zero meaning they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe.

Speaker 1:          02:21          The second type called inertial confinement uses pulses from super powered lasers to hit the surface of a palace, a fuel imploding. It briefly making the feel hot and dense enough to fuse. In fact, one of the most powerful lasers in the world is used for fusion experiments at the national ignition facility in the u s these experiments and others like them around the world are today just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology and although they can achieve fusion right now, it costs more energy to do the experiments than they produce infusion. The technology has a long way to go before it's commercially viable and maybe it never will be. It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth bars if against that it will be sell efficient. There's a single glass of seawater could be used to produce as much energy as burning a barrel of oil with no waste to speak of.

Speaker 1:          03:20          This is because fusion reactors would use hydrogen or helium as fuel and seawater is loaded with hydrogen, but not just any hydrogen. We'll do specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and tritium are needed to make the right reactions. Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance. In Sea water, though tritium is a bit trickier, it's radioactive and there may only be 20 kilograms of is in the world, mostly in nuclear warheads, which makes it incredibly expensive, so we may need another fusion buddy for deuterium instead of tritium. Helium three an isotope of helium might be a great substitute. Unfortunately, it's also incredibly rare on earth, but here the moon might have the answer over billions of years, the soda wind may have built up a huge deposits of helium three on the moon. Instead of making helium three we can minus. If we could set the lunar dust for helium, we'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years. One more argument for establishing a moon base if you weren't convinced already. Okay. Maybe you think building a mini son still sounds kind of dangerous, but they'd actually be much safer than most other types of power plant.

Speaker 1:          04:42          A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant, which can melt down catastrophic catastrophically if the confinement failed than the plasma would expand and cool and the reaction would stop put simply. It's not a bomb. The release of radioactive fueled light tritium could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water, which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately, there's no more than a few grams of tritium end use at a given time, so a leak would be quickly diluted. So we've just told you that there's nearly unlimited energy to be had at no expense to the environment in something as simple as water. So what's the catch cost? We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable. Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build. The main drawback is that it's unproven technology. It's a $10 billion gamble and that money might be better spent on other clean energy that's already proven itself. Maybe we should cut our losses or maybe when the payoff is unlimited clean energy for everyone, it might be worth the risk videos.
