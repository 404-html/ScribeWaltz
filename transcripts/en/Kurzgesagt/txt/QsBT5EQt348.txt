Speaker 1:          00:01          Never before in history has there been so many people on earth as right now, our numbers have skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1800 to 2.3 billion in 1943 point 7 billion in 1970 and 7.4 billion in 2016 the world population increased four fold in the last century. So what can we expect for the next century and what does population growth have been for our future? Will there be mass migration, overcrowded slums in mega cities covering continents, diseases and pollution, chaos and violence. So for energy, water, and food, and the human species focus to only on sustaining itself. Will population growth destroy our way of life or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic?

Speaker 2:          01:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03          In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate which led to apocalyptic prophecies. The pool would procreate endlessly and overrun the developed world. The legend of overpopulation was born basket turns out high birth rates in the population explosion. I'm not permanent features of some cultures or countries, but rather part of a four step process. The whole world is going through the demographic transition. Most developed countries have already made the transition while other countries aren't doing it right. Now, let's go back to the 18th century. When the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition. By today's standards, Europe was worse off than a developing region suffering from poor sanitation, poor diet, and poor medicine. A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly. Group women have between four and six children, but only two of them would reach adult hood.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and brought the greatest change in human living conditions. Since the agricultural revolution, people went from being peasants to workers, manufactures goods were mass produced and became widely available. This science has flourished and advanced transportation, communication and medicine. The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation. Slowly, this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raise standards of living and healthcare for the poor working population. The second transition stage started better food supplies, hygiene and medicine. Men. People stopped dying all the time, especially so at a very young age, the result was a population explosion doubling the uks population between 1750 and 1850 the main reason the founders used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive. Now that had changed, so the third stage of the transition was set in motion.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Fewer babies were conceived and population growth slow down. Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable. Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition. This didn't only happen in the UK. More and more countries went through the four stages. First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions. Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion. Third fewer deaths resulting in fewer births and population growth came to an end. But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population is still growing so fast? Well, the children born in the population explosion of the seventies and eighties now having kids themselves now leading to a noticeable spike in overall population, but they are having far fewer children on average than their parents. The average today is 2.5 it was five 40 years ago.

Speaker 1:          04:10          So as this generation gets older and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing. This is true for every country in the west. We tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world, but actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage. Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971 the average woman had seven kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of five and 2015 the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average. This is the rule, not an exception. We're not special. We just had a headstart. It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than six children to less than three others are catching up. Forest, Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years. Bangladesh took just 20. Iran managed it in 10 years.

Speaker 1:          05:05          All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch. And the more support they get, the faster they catch up. This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, uh, so important no matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth or you just want fewer refugees coming to your country. The simple truth is that it's beneficial to you personally. If people on the other side of the globe can live a good life and we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today. So the future of global population growth is actually not an apocalyptic prophecy at all. It's a promise population growth will come to an ENT. The UN forecast that the 12000000000th human will never be born at all. And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people with a higher education will increase tenfold. Countries who used to be a need. We'll help advance development in stat. More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.
