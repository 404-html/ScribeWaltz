Speaker 1:          00:01          Dave, the last star will die and the universe will turn dark forever. It will probably be a red dwarf, a tiny kind of start. That's also one of our best bet is to find alien life and might be the last home of humanity before the university becomes uninhabitable. So what do we know about them and why are they our last hope?

Speaker 1:          00:32          At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there with only about seven to 50% of the mass of our sun, not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter, which is still huge. Though they are also very dim. It's impossible to see them with the naked eye. You've never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clear the observe. Red Dwarfs in our neighborhood, approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to Earth are red dwarfs like all stars. Red Dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive stars accumulate all the fuse helium in there, cause red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that the helium and hydrogen constantly mix, so they use up their fuel incredibly slowly before they're extinguished. Red Dwarfs burn so slowly that that average lifespan is between one and 10 trillion years.

Speaker 1:          01:27          By comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years because the university is only 13.7 5 billion years old. Not a single red dwarf has reached a later development stages. Every single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star and the entire universe is also a red wolf because small red dwarfs are right on the verge of being a star at all, just a tiny bit less hydrogen and they own bear. Brown dwarfs failed stars that cannot sustain a fusion reaction for long. So what about aliens or a new home for humanity? Since our son will die one day will eventually need to look for a new home and where there are habitable planet, there might also be aliens. The Kepler space observatory found that at least half of all red dwarfs host rock planet between half and four times the mass of our earth.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Many of them are in the habitable zone, the area around a style where water can be liquid, but since red dwarves Burnet relatively cold temperatures, that would need to be really close to be hospitable, probably as close as mercury to our son or even closer, which brings with it all kinds of problems. For example, a planet this close to a style would probably be tidally locked, meaning the same side would always face it. This side would be incredibly hot while the shadow side would be frozen, which makes it hard for life to develop all new. A planet with a big enough ocean might be able to distribute this energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitational forces at the red dwarf could squeeze the canister and heated up so much, but it might lose all its water. Over time, these planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Another problem is that many red wolves vary in their energy output. They can be covered in star spots that condemned. They're emitted light by up to 40% for months, which would cause oceans on planets to freeze over at other times. They can emit powerful solar flares, sudden outbursts of energy, incredibly powerful. These red dwarfs can double their brightness in minutes, which could strip away sizeable portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering it sterile. On the other hand, they're extremely long. Lifespan is a big plus. A red dwarf with just moderate levels of activity could be an amazing place for a pennant and hosts life. Life on earth has existed for about 4 billion years and we have about a billion years left before the sun becomes so hard that complex life on earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave earth and look for a new hope.

Speaker 1:          04:05          We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years around a red dwarf with the right conditions. About 5% of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way. May host habitable roughly earth sized planets that would be more than 4 billion in total, but life may not even need a planet like earth. Candidates for life around a red dwarf, maybe the moons of gas giants also called super earths ready, massive rocky planets. All in all, there are an estimated 60 billion potentially habitable planets around red dwarves, and that's in the Milky Way alone. So wolves might become really important for our survival in the future, but everything has to die at some point. Even red dwarfs when in trillions of years, the life of the last Red Dwarf in the university is about to end. It will not be a very spectacular event. As it's hundred runs, outage shrinks becoming a blue dwarf, burning out completely after it's fueled is spent.

Speaker 1:          05:02          It's transformed into a white dwarf and object about as smart as earth packed, very densely and made of degenerate gases, mostly of helion for nuclei. Having no more source of energy, it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years until it becomes its final format. A cold, blank dwarf white and Black Two offs are so fascinating that they deserve their own video anyway. It's going to be a long time before the last stars in the universe of vanish. It's kind of uplifting to know that if humanity succeeds in venturing into space, we have plenty of time before the universe turns out the lights, Avocados a made thanks to your support on patrion.com if you want to help us make more of them, we really appreciate your support.
