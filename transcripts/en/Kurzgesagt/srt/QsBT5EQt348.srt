1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,700
Never before in history has there been
so many people on earth as right now,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,180
our numbers have skyrocketed
from 1 billion in 1800 to
2.3 billion in 1943 point

3
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:18,501
7 billion in 1970 and 7.4 billion in
2016 the world population increased four

4
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,820
fold in the last century.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,710
So what can we expect for the next century
and what does population growth have

6
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,670
been for our future?
Will there be mass migration,

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,710
overcrowded slums in mega cities covering
continents, diseases and pollution,

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,250
chaos and violence. So for
energy, water, and food,

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,720
and the human species focus
to only on sustaining itself.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,330
Will population growth destroy our
way of life or is this prophecy just

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,830
ungrounded panic?

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,473
Yeah.

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,090
In the 1960s population growth reached
an unprecedented rate which led to

14
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,050
apocalyptic prophecies.

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,570
The pool would procreate endlessly
and overrun the developed world.

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,110
The legend of overpopulation was born
basket turns out high birth rates in the

17
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:26,250
population explosion. I'm not permanent
features of some cultures or countries,

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,650
but rather part of a four step process.

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,040
The whole world is going through
the demographic transition.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,930
Most developed countries have already
made the transition while other countries

21
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,800
aren't doing it right. Now, let's
go back to the 18th century.

22
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,630
When the entire world,
including Europe,

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,130
was in the first stage of the demographic
transition. By today's standards,

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,480
Europe was worse off than a developing
region suffering from poor sanitation,

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,740
poor diet, and poor medicine.
A lot of people were born,

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,580
but lots of them died just as fast,
so the population hardly.

27
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,970
Group women have between
four and six children,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,330
but only two of them
would reach adult hood.

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,320
Then the industrial revolution happened
in the UK and brought the greatest

30
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,830
change in human living conditions.
Since the agricultural revolution,

31
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,160
people went from being
peasants to workers,

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,320
manufactures goods were mass
produced and became widely available.

33
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,160
This science has flourished
and advanced transportation,

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,810
communication and medicine.

35
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,850
The role of women in society shifted
and created the conditions for their

36
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,070
emancipation.
Slowly,

37
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,980
this economic progress not
only formed a middle class,

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,580
but also raise standards of living
and healthcare for the poor working

39
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,414
population.

40
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,220
The second transition stage
started better food supplies,

41
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,610
hygiene and medicine. Men. People
stopped dying all the time,

42
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,620
especially so at a very young age,

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,310
the result was a population explosion
doubling the uks population between 1750

44
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:03,400
and 1850 the main reason the founders
used to have lots of children was that

45
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,300
only a few of them were likely to survive.
Now that had changed,

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,090
so the third stage of the
transition was set in motion.

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,840
Fewer babies were conceived and
population growth slow down.

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,960
Eventually a balance emerged,

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,870
fewer people were dying and
fewer children were born,

50
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,630
so the death rate and
birth rate became stable.

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,260
Britain had reached the fourth
stage of the demographic transition.

52
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,350
This didn't only happen in the UK.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,670
More and more countries went
through the four stages. First,

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,330
many births and many deaths due
to bad living conditions. Second,

55
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,350
better living conditions leading to
fewer deaths and a population explosion.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,720
Third fewer deaths resulting in fewer
births and population growth came to an

57
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,200
end.
But if birth rates have dropped so much,

58
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,740
why is the population is
still growing so fast? Well,

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,290
the children born in the
population explosion of the
seventies and eighties now

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,630
having kids themselves now leading to a
noticeable spike in overall population,

61
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,050
but they are having far fewer children
on average than their parents.

62
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,340
The average today is 2.5
it was five 40 years ago.

63
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,620
So as this generation gets older
and fertility declines further,

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,320
the rate of population
growth will keep on slowing.

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,010
This is true for every
country in the west.

66
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,680
We tend to overlook progress
in other regions of the world,

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,520
but actually most of the world's countries
have made it to the fourth stage.

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,890
Just look at Bangladesh.
In 1971 the average woman had seven kids,

69
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,070
but 25% of them would die before the age
of five and 2015 the mortality rate was

70
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:42,610
down to 3.8% and women had
only 2.2 kids on average.

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,280
This is the rule, not an exception. We're
not special. We just had a headstart.

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,600
It took developed countries about 80
years to reduce fertility from more than

73
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,800
six children to less than three
others are catching up. Forest,

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,280
Malaysia and South Africa
did it in only 34 years.

75
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,570
Bangladesh took just 20.
Iran managed it in 10 years.

76
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,380
All these countries that are catching
up didn't have to start from scratch.

77
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,080
And the more support they get,
the faster they catch up.

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,460
This is why programs that help lower
child mortality or help poor nations

79
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:18,970
develop, uh, so important no
matter what your motivation is,

80
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,780
whether you dream of a world where all
people live in freedom and wealth or you

81
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,210
just want fewer refugees
coming to your country.

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,180
The simple truth is that it's
beneficial to you personally.

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,210
If people on the other side of the globe
can live a good life and we are getting

84
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,270
there,

85
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,440
the percentage of people living in
extreme poverty has never been as low as

86
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,274
today.

87
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,930
So the future of global population
growth is actually not an apocalyptic

88
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,550
prophecy at all. It's a promise
population growth will come to an ENT.

89
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,440
The UN forecast that the 12000000000th
human will never be born at all.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,500
And as the development
level of the world rises,

91
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,280
the number of people with a higher
education will increase tenfold.

92
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,960
Countries who used to be a need.
We'll help advance development in stat.

93
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,750
More people is going to mean more
people able to advance our species.
