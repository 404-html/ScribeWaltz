1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,610
What makes a bonus so dangerous?
How can a virus overwhelmed?

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:08,730
They're very complex defense system of
the body so quickly and so effectively.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,520
Let's take a look at what Ebola does.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,630
Ebola is a virus.
A virus is a very small thing,

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,470
a bit of RNA or DNA and
a few proteins in a hole.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,510
It has no ability to do anything by
itself whatsoever and can only survive and

7
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:35,460
proliferate by infecting cells. To
avoid this, we have the immune system.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,100
The immune system is super complex,

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,190
so we developed a visual system
that makes it easy to understand.

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,350
So it looks like this.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,160
Let's concentrate on the part that's
critical to understanding of Bola and

12
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,994
ignore the rest.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,070
So usually dendritic cells would
activate an army of antivirus cells,

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,180
support cells and antibody factories
that work together with the guard cells

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,590
wipe out the infection and a matter
of days. But when Ebola strikes,

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,260
it directly attacks the immune system.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,370
Some of the first sales it takes over our,
the dendritic cells,

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,090
the brains of the immune system,
the Ebola virus,

19
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,050
and is a dendritic cell by binding
onto receptors for cell transport.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,610
Once it's insight,

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,690
it dissolves it's outer hole and
releases its genetic material,

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,820
nuclear proteins and enzymes. In a
nutshell, it takes over the cell,

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,990
disables the cells,

24
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,991
protective mechanisms and reprograms
at the cell now becomes a fire risk

25
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:37,050
reduction machine and uses its
resources to build Ebola virus hits.

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,330
Once the cell is saturated,

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,070
it dissolves the cell membrane and
millions of viruses are released into the

28
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,904
tissue.

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,960
The virus not only prevents the dendritic
cell from activating the specialized

30
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,280
antivirus forces,

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,870
it manipulates it into sending signal
proteins that trick the specialized cells

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,120
into ending their own lives prematurely,

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,660
so the immune system is
seriously disrupted and unable
to react while the virus

34
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,270
rapidly multiplies.
We're talking billions.

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,980
There are cells that should deal with
infected cells, the natural killer cells,

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,570
but they also get infected and just die
before they can prevent the disease from

37
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:20,070
spreading. At the same time, a bowler
infects the guard cells of the body,

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,160
macrophages and monocytes not only
managing to circumvent their defenses,

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,460
it also manipulates them to signal to
the cells that make up the blood vessels,

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,420
telling them to release fluids into
the body. Usually there's makes sense,

41
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,690
but in this case it just causes mayhem
all over the body and neutrophils are

42
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,240
activated a welcome by the virus
and the macrophages signals.

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,320
They're not very effective against
viruses and should not be involved in this

44
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,870
fight and begin to do lots
of stuff they shouldn't do.

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,640
The neutrophils signal the blood vessels
to release more fluid causing internal

46
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,720
bleeding. Another area of the body
of bone or attacks is the liver.

47
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,230
The virus,

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,650
it very easy to enter the liver and it
quickly starts killing loads of liver

49
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,360
cells and causing organ failure and
more internal bleeding and all of those

50
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,380
things are going on at the
same time as the virus spreads.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,810
It's like nukes exploding everywhere.

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,140
One incident of this in one
region would be problem enough,

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,880
but now it's starting to happen
everywhere at once. All the mechanisms,

54
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,410
the immune system has evolved to handle
infections work against you and the

55
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:31,150
virus continues to spread and spread and
finally begins to infect more and more

56
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,450
body cells while the body
desperately struggles to stay alive.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,090
In a desperate last
effort to turn the tide.

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,640
The immune system
launches a cytokine storm.

59
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,920
A cytokine storm is an SOS signal that
causes the immune system to launch all of

60
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,340
its weapons all at once in
a desperate kamikaze attack.

61
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,600
This hurts the virus, but leaves
behind tons of collateral damage,

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,200
especially in the blood vessels.
Paradoxically,

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,070
the healthier the immune system,
the more damage it can do to itself.

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,860
More and more off to it
leaves the bloodstream.

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,480
Blood pours out of every opening of the
body. You become seriously dehydrated.

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,800
There's just not enough blood left to
supply the organs with oxygen and cells

67
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:16,630
begin to die. If you reach this point,
the chance of you dying is very high.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,730
Currently, six out of 10 in
fact, it's die from Ebola. Wow.

69
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,830
Okay. Ebola is nasty, so it's
time to panic, right? No,

70
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,000
not even close.

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,230
The severity of Ebola gets papers
sold and the youtube video shed,

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,510
so everybody is talking about Ebola,

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,280
but currently the only way to get infected
by a boater is to come into contact

74
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:43,270
with the bodily fluids of a person who
show symptoms or from an infected bat.

75
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,460
So just don't do that.

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,270
Ebola has killed 5,000 people since June,

77
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,260
2014 the common flu kills up
to 500,000 people each year.

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,480
Malaria kills up to 1 million each year,
3000 people every single day,

79
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,880
10 children since this video started.

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,220
So even if Ebola is terrible and scary,
don't let yourself be scared.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,300
The most infectious thing about
Ebola is the media hype around it.

82
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,210
You could learn a bit more
about the immune system though.
