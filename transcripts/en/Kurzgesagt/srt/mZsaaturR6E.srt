1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,440
The fundamental currency
of our universe is energy.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,870
It lights our homes, grows our
food, powers our computers.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,740
We can get it lots of ways.
Burning fossil fuels,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,190
splitting atoms or sunlight
striking photo of all tags,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,110
but there's a downside to everything.
Fossil fuels are extremely toxic.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,780
Nuclear waste as well.
Nuclear waste,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,710
and there are not enough batteries to
store sunlight for cloudy days yet,

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,570
and yet the sun seems to have
virtually limitless free energy.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,730
Is there a way we could build a
sun on earth? Can we bottle a star?

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,590
The Sun shines because of nuclear fusion.
In a nutshell,

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,050
fusion is a thermo nuclear process,

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,600
meaning that the ingredients
have to be incredibly hot,

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,040
so hot that the atoms are stripped
of their electrons making a plasma.

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,010
When Nuclei and electrons
bounce around freely,

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,390
since nuclei are all positively charged,
they repel each other.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,680
In order to overcome this repulsion,
the particles have to be going very,

17
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:18,060
very fast. In this context,
very fast means that very hot,

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,010
millions of degrees stars cheat
to reach these temperatures.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,710
They are so massive that
the pressure in there,

20
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,700
because that generates the
heats to squeeze the nuclei
together until they merge

21
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,140
and fuse creating heavier nuclei
and releasing energy in the process.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,020
It is this energy release that scientists
hope to harness in a new generation of

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,410
powerplant the fusion reactor on earth.

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,550
It's not feasible to use this,
a brute force method to create fusion.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,240
So if we wanted to build a react to
that generates energy from fusion,

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,060
we have to get clever.
To date,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,110
scientists have invented two ways of
making plasmas hot enough to fuse.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,790
The first type of reactor uses a
magnetic field to squeeze a plasma in a

29
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,520
doughnut shaped chamber where
the reactions take place.

30
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,750
These magnetic confinement
reactors such as the ite,

31
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,340
our reactor in France use super conducting
electromagnets cooled with liquid

32
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,810
helium to within a few degrees of absolute
zero meaning they host some of the

33
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,330
biggest temperature gradients
in the known universe.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,490
The second type called inertial
confinement uses pulses from super powered

35
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,670
lasers to hit the surface of a palace,
a fuel imploding.

36
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:34,110
It briefly making the feel hot
and dense enough to fuse. In fact,

37
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,700
one of the most powerful lasers in the
world is used for fusion experiments at

38
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:43,650
the national ignition facility in the u
s these experiments and others like them

39
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,470
around the world are
today just experiments.

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,140
Scientists are still
developing the technology

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,190
and although they can
achieve fusion right now,

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,480
it costs more energy to do the
experiments than they produce infusion.

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,010
The technology has a long way to go before
it's commercially viable and maybe it

44
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,844
never will be.

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,450
It might just be impossible to make a
viable fusion reactor on earth bars if

46
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,860
against that it will be sell efficient.

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,510
There's a single glass of seawater could
be used to produce as much energy as

48
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,510
burning a barrel of oil
with no waste to speak of.

49
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,490
This is because fusion reactors would
use hydrogen or helium as fuel and

50
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,810
seawater is loaded with hydrogen,
but not just any hydrogen.

51
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,811
We'll do specific isotopes with extra
neutrons called Deuterium and tritium are

52
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,160
needed to make the right reactions.

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,420
Deuterium is stable and can be
found in abundance. In Sea water,

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,490
though tritium is a bit trickier,

55
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,440
it's radioactive and there may only
be 20 kilograms of is in the world,

56
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,130
mostly in nuclear warheads,
which makes it incredibly expensive,

57
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,390
so we may need another fusion buddy
for deuterium instead of tritium.

58
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,160
Helium three an isotope of helium
might be a great substitute.

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,910
Unfortunately,
it's also incredibly rare on earth,

60
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,540
but here the moon might have the
answer over billions of years,

61
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,140
the soda wind may have built up a huge
deposits of helium three on the moon.

62
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,890
Instead of making helium
three we can minus.

63
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,220
If we could set the lunar dust for helium,

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,940
we'd have enough fuel to power the
entire world for thousands of years.

65
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,680
One more argument for establishing a moon
base if you weren't convinced already.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,530
Okay. Maybe you think building a mini
son still sounds kind of dangerous,

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,510
but they'd actually be much safer
than most other types of power plant.

68
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,010
A fusion reactor is not
like a nuclear plant,

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,360
which can melt down catastrophic
catastrophically if the
confinement failed than

70
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,250
the plasma would expand and cool and
the reaction would stop put simply.

71
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,570
It's not a bomb.

72
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,030
The release of radioactive fueled light
tritium could pose a threat to the

73
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:05,140
environment. Tritium could bond with
oxygen making radioactive water,

74
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,730
which could be dangerous as it seeps
into the environment. Fortunately,

75
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,270
there's no more than a few grams
of tritium end use at a given time,

76
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,400
so a leak would be quickly diluted.

77
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,410
So we've just told you that there's
nearly unlimited energy to be had at no

78
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,440
expense to the environment in
something as simple as water.

79
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,800
So what's the catch cost?

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,640
We simply don't know if fusion power
will ever be commercially viable.

81
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,510
Even if they work,
they might be too expensive to ever build.

82
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,930
The main drawback is that
it's unproven technology.

83
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,450
It's a $10 billion gamble and that money
might be better spent on other clean

84
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,850
energy that's already proven itself.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Maybe we should cut our losses or maybe
when the payoff is unlimited clean

86
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,270
energy for everyone,
it might be worth the risk
