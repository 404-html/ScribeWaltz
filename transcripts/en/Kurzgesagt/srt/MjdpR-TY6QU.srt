1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,450
Health is the most valuable
thing we have in life,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,120
but we tend to forget
that until we lose it.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,510
We're living longer than ever before,
which is great,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,800
but as an unforeseen consequence of
this is that we also spend a larger and

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,080
larger portion of our lives being sick.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,460
Guessing old currently means
spending more time in pain.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,710
So scientists are trying to shift the
attention of the medical community from

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,310
optimizing lifespans to
optimizing health spans.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,750
The part of our lives during which
we're disease free. To do this,

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,200
we need to attack the root cause
of almost all bodily defects.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,500
Aging itself unbeknown to most people,

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,640
the signs of aging has made enormous
progress in the last few years with human

13
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,530
trials about to begin in the near future.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,630
Let's look at three examples
of discoveries that might
benefit people who are

15
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,860
alive right now.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,873
Yeah,

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,910
one senescent cells.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,660
Your cells have an expiration date.
Each time one of your cells divide,

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,320
it copies its chromosomes.
Because of the way this works,

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,760
they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the end.
This could be catastrophic,

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,350
so to protect themselves,

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,430
we have long segments of DNA called
telomeres that sort of act like the stiff

23
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,900
bits at the end of shoe laces,

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,100
but they shrink with every
cell division and some cells.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,450
After a number of divisions,

26
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,480
the telomeres are gone and
the cell becomes a Zombie,

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,240
a senescent cell senescent
cells stay around and don't die.

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,670
The older you get,
the more of them there are inside you.

29
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,800
They harm tissue around them and are
linked to many diseases that accompany old

30
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,110
age like diabetes and kidney failure.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,040
But what if you could kill them off
scientists genetically engineered mice so

32
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,990
that they could destroy their
senescent cells as they pleased.

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,060
Older mice without senescent
cells will more active.

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,220
The hearts and kidneys worked better
and they were less prone to cancer.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Overall, they lived up to 30% longer
and in better health than average mice.

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,790
Since we can't genetically engineered
all of the cells in the human body,

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,820
we need to find another way to
get rid of our senescent cells,

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,910
but how do we kill them
without harming healthy cells?

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,250
Most cells in the body
commit to a programmed cell
suicide when they're damaged,

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,230
but senescent cells don't.

41
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,940
It turns out that they under produce a
protein that tells them when it's time to

42
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,870
die.
So in uh,

43
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,400
late 2016 study mice were given
an injection of this protein.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,680
It killed 80% of all their senescent
cells while causing almost no harm to

45
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:46,520
healthy cells.

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,380
The treated mice became generally
healthier and even regrew last hat.

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,143
As a result,

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,840
there are a number of new companies
looking at treatments involving senescent

49
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,590
cells and the first human trials will soon

50
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,210
to nad plus cells are made from
hundreds of millions of parts that are

51
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:12,430
structures, machines, messages, and the
catalysts that make reactions happen.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,230
All these parts constantly need to
be destroyed, cleaned up and rebuilt.

53
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,390
As we age, this process becomes less
effective and so parts become crumpled,

54
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,410
bunched up,

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,300
or are removed slower or they are no
longer produced in the quantities we need.

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,910
One of these parts is Nad plus a coenzyme
that tells ourselves to look out for

57
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,310
themselves as age 50.

58
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,430
We only have about half as much in our
bodies as we do at age 20 low amounts of

59
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,610
it are linked to a whole bunch of
diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's,

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,640
cardiovascular disease
and multiple sclerosis,

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,320
but nad plus content or cells,
so we can't get it as a pill,

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,150
but scientists noticed that other more
flexible substances could enter cells and

63
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,151
would then turn into Nad plus end site
in 2016 multiple trials on mice show that

64
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,200
they boosted the multiplication of skin,
brain and muscle stem cells.

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,210
They were rejuvenated,

66
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,770
had a higher ability to repair their DNA
and had a slightly increased lifespan.

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,500
This even got NASA interested,

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,190
which is looking for a way to minimize
the DNA damage astronauts would be

69
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,160
exposed to from cosmic
radiation on Mars missions.

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,160
There are human trials
being planned right now,

71
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,210
but it's too soon to say if this will
boost our health span or even lifespan,

72
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,780
but nad plus is a serious candidate and
could become the first human anti aging

73
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:40,600
bill.
Three stem cells.

74
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,240
Stem cells are like cell blueprints that
sit at various places in the body and

75
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,630
copied themselves to produce a
steady flow of fresh young cells.

76
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,670
But they decline as we age.

77
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,210
And so we declined to without new parts.

78
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,360
Human bodies break in mice.

79
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,960
Scientists observe that as the stem
cells in their brains disappeared.

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,970
They started to develop diseases,

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,640
so they took stem cells from baby mice
brains and injected them directly into

82
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,320
the brains of middle aged mice.

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,510
More specifically the hypothalamus apart
that involved in regulating a lot of

84
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,440
bodily functions,

85
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,140
the fresh stem cells reinvigorated older
brain cells by secreting micro RNA is

86
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,200
that regulated their metabolism.
After four months,

87
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,850
brain and muscles worked better than those
of untreated mice and on average they

88
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,230
lived at 10% longer.

89
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,840
Another study took stem cells from mice
embryos and injected them directly into

90
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,750
the hearts of older mice.
As a consequence,

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
they had improved heart function could
exercise 20% longer and weirdly enough

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,890
their hair regrew faster.

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,860
What all of this tells us is that there
is not a single magic bullet with which

94
00:05:56,861 --> 00:06:00,860
to aging. It requires a complex
array of different therapies.

95
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,220
We can kill off senescent
cells to clear away the junk,

96
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,450
give ourselves fresh new stem cells to
fill the gap all while regulating the

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,820
metabolism of the other
cells using medication.

98
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,240
This video comes with a big caveat.

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,570
After all these studies have
been carried out on mice,

100
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,010
there's no guarantee the same therapist
would work in us to the same extent,

101
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,900
but they are proof of concepts.

102
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,120
To learn more about how we can modify our
own health span, we need human trials.

103
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,530
We've only covered a tiny part of the
research that's being done right now and

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,600
only scratched the surface of these ideas.

105
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,440
The field of health span extension
needs more attention and funding.

106
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,540
If it gets it. All of us might
enjoy growing old without pain.

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,410
If you now want to support the
research on aging directly,
