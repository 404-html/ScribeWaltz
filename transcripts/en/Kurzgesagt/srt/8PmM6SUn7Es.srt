1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,220
Over the last few years,

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:06,900
organic food has spread like
wildfire despite higher prices.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,060
Buying organic is turning from an
alternative into a moral and social

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,930
responsibility.
Organic food is supposedly healthier,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,090
more natural and more ethical,

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,720
but what do we even mean
when we say organic?

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,660
There's no global consensus,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
so different regions have different
definitions and rules and general organic

9
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,190
food is farmed without GMO seeds,

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,360
synthetic fertilizers or
synthetic pesticides. Instead,

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,040
organic farmers use more traditional
ways of producing food like crop rotation

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,820
and use organic fertilizers
such as compost or manure.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,840
While the motivation to buy
organic food is clearly noble,

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,060
is it actually effective or just
another costly trend we can skip without

15
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:54,894
feeling guilty?

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,610
Is Organic Food Healthier?

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,950
One idea associated with organic crops
is that their natural cultivation as

18
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:14,640
supposed to make them more
nutritious and healthier. Indeed,

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,020
several studies found that organic
foods contain more antioxidants.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,920
Plants produce them as a
sort of homemade pesticide.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,190
Organic plants seem to have
to work a little harder.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,190
While regular plants have
plenty of help from humans.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
Antioxidants are believed to
have some health benefits,

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,970
although scientists are still on
the fence about them. In general,

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,630
we have no idea if and how exactly they
help us or how much produce you'd have

26
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,560
to eat to absorb a certain amount.

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,300
What about organic being more nutritious?
Well,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,740
the evidence is mixed.

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,330
Some studies found that organic food can
have slightly higher concentrations of

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,850
vitamin C and omega three fatty acids,

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,560
while others did not find
significant differences. Overall,

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,180
the mixed evidence suggests that there
are only small differences in nutritional

33
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,780
value,
so from the science available so far,

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,350
it doesn't look like organic food
has significant health benefits.

35
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,570
What we do know is that eating fruit and
veggies in general is good for you and

36
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,190
most of us don't do that enough.

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,350
Eating veggies is more important for
your health than how they were produced.

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
Is Organic food more natural people
don't only buy organic to get extra

39
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,040
vitamins,
but to avoid something toxic.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Artificial pesticides and fertilizers
and indeed several studies so that that

41
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,730
actually is less pesticide
residue on organic projects.

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,310
But here's where things get complicated.

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,090
Less pesticide does not mean none at all.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,760
While pesticides are supposed to be a
last resort in organic farming than not

45
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,594
forbidden.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,770
Most organic pesticides are natural
toxins like vegetable oils, potash, soap,

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,390
sulfa or copper sulfates, but there
are synthetic substances as well.

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,770
What's the difference between
organic and regular pesticides?

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,360
Not so a lot actually.

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,040
Organic pesticides are not necessarily
safer than conventional ones.

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
Toxic is toxic.

52
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,150
New Mass refer substances manufactured
or derived from nature. In fact,

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,960
in the case of copper cell face
often used on organic apples,

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,040
the organic pesticide of choice is
actually more harmful to humans.

55
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,710
The toxicity of any substance depends on
its concentration and your exposure to

56
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,930
it,
not if it's natural or not.

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,180
There are few reasons studies about how
our current level of pesticide exposure

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,920
affects our longterm health.

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,230
The 2018 study from France associated
never eating organic food with a higher

60
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,490
risk of certain cancers.
This study was criticized a lot,

61
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,420
though the participants reported
their dietary habits themselves.

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,020
While no actual tests of pesticide
levels in their bodies were done.

63
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,690
Complicating things even more.

64
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,220
A Danish study from 2018 found that the
danger from pesticides for an adult with

65
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,740
seminar to drinking a glass
of wine every three months,

66
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,060
the pesticides on your vegetables
are nothing to lose sleep over.

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,920
Despite this, we should continue to
demand strict standards for our food.

68
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,670
All pesticides are regulated and tested
very strictly in the EU and the US.

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,120
Every year thousands of food
samples are screened for pesticides.

70
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,580
The majority of samples have no residues
or just a fraction of the tolerance

71
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,440
level.
Right now,

72
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,590
contamination from bacteria and fungus
is much more dangerous and on this front

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,170
the risk is the same bit
organic or regular food.

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,310
Is Organic food better
for the environment?

75
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,750
In 2017 a Meta analysis looked at organic
farming in detail and analyzed organic

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
and regular foods from over 700
production sources and their impact on

77
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,030
categories like greenhouse gas emissions,
energy consumption and land needs.

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,500
The result, no production method is
clearly better for the environment.

79
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,730
Organic systems use less
energy than conventional ones,

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,220
but have similar greenhouse gas emissions.

81
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,650
Organic farms use less pesticide but
need much more land to produce the same

82
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,770
amount of crop.
These mixed results.

83
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,950
We're also confirmed by our report
from the Swedish food agency.

84
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Organic and regular were equal.
In most regards,

85
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,900
the biggest difference was land use
and here are conventional farming,

86
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:45,901
clearly one and econ toxicity where
organic farming has a clear advantage.

87
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,760
So according to these results,

88
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,200
conventional farming actually has a
little bit less impact on the environment

89
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,430
compared to organic.

90
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
The bottom line is organic isn't superior
to regular produce as far as we know,

91
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,000
but organic agriculture also has
an impact at a broader level.

92
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,980
Demand is rising constantly and the
struggle to supply the market can lead to

93
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,420
production methods that are
less sustainable than other
ways. Spain, for example,

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,931
gross,

95
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,730
tons of regular and organic vegetables
destined for export in vast greenhouse

96
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:24,410
areas which use a lot of energy and
have other environmental impacts such as

97
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,140
significantly higher
greenhouse gas emissions.

98
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,460
And because growing demand can't
be covered by domestic production,

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,790
the global trade and organic
foods is also increasing.

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,040
As supply chains get more and more complex
to make all kinds of foods available

101
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,110
in organic quality shoring,

102
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,190
organic quality standards and
regulations gets ever more difficult.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This has led to incidences of fraud where
conventional food was labeled and sold

104
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,110
as expensive organic projects,

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,540
but organic versus conventional food
isn't even an objective discussion.

106
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,150
Organic is not simply a production
method for many, it's an ideology.

107
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,760
Buying organic feels right.

108
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,170
People want to do the correct thing for
the health of their children and the

109
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,370
wellbeing of the planet,

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,120
but our instinct is to think of organic
as good and conventional as bad can get

111
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,520
in the way of making the
most reasonable decision.

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,680
The solution could be to stop seeing
organic and conventional farming as

113
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,670
irreconcilable.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,020
They both have pros and cons and
the best way to produce healthy food

115
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:38,021
efficiently would be a combination of
their best features and ask for your

116
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:43,280
personal shopping. What foods you should
buy depends on what you expect from it.

117
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,010
If you simply want to eat healthily,

118
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,330
we should buy more fruits and veggies
of any kind, not necessarily organic.

119
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,890
If your concern is for the environment
than simply buying organic,

120
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,480
we'll solve this problem for you.

121
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,190
The easiest option is to buy
local food that's in season.

122
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,320
Basically seasonal is the true organic.
To sum up,

123
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,230
an organic label is a
manufacturing notice,

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,130
not a security certificate or
a silver bullet for your diet.

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,960
What you eat is much more
important than how it's produced.

126
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,630
Production is very important for our
animations though we make them with a lot

127
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:28,200
of love and care and the best thing
is you can learn how to do them.
