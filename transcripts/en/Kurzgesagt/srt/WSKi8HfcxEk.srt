1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,720
How long do you think it will take before
machines do your job better than you

2
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:06,554
do?

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,420
Automation used to mean
big stupid machines doing
repetitive work in factories

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,800
today. They can learn their craft,
diagnose cancer and trade stocks.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,750
We are entering a new age of automation
unlike anything that's come before.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,060
According to a 2013 study,

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,140
almost half of all jobs in the u s could
potentially be automated in the next

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:31,400
two decades, but wait, it hasn't
automation been around for decades.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,110
What's different this time?

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,340
The things you used to be simple.

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,330
Innovation made human work
easier and productivity rose,

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,410
which means that more staff for services
could be produced per hour using the

13
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,910
same amount of human workers.

14
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,800
This eliminated many jobs but also
created other jobs that were better,

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,220
which was important because of the
growing population needed work.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,390
So in a nutshell, innovation,
higher productivity,

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,440
fewer old jobs and many
new and often better jobs.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,900
Overall, this worked well for a majority
of people and living standards improved.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,340
There's a clear progression in terms
of what humans did for a living.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,960
For the longest time we
worked in agriculture with
the industrial revolution.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,640
This shifted to production jobs and
as automation became more widespread,

22
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,970
humans shifted into service jobs and
then only a few moments ago in human

23
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:43,600
history, the information age happened.
Suddenly the rules were different.

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,160
How jobs are now being taken over by
machines much faster than they were in the

25
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:52,930
past. That's worrying of course,
but innovation will clearly save us,

26
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:56,800
right? While new inflammation,
age industries are booming,

27
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,860
they are creating fewer
and fewer new jobs.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,760
In 1979 general motors employed more
than 800,000 workers and made about 11

29
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,443
billion US dollars.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,200
In 2012 Google made about 14 billion US
dollars while employing 58,000 people.

31
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,780
You may not like this comparison,

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,080
but Google is an example of what
created new jobs in the past.

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,630
Innovative new industries, old, innovative
industries are running out of steam.

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,740
Just look at cars.
When they became a thing 100 years ago,

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,390
they created huge industries,
cause transformed our way of life,

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,610
our infrastructure and our cities.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,870
Millions of people found jobs
either directly or indirectly,

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,250
decades of investment cap.
This momentum going today.

39
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:49,090
This process is largely complete
innovation in the car industry.

40
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,830
It does not create as many jobs as it
used to while the electric cars are great

41
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:58,240
and all, they won't create
millions of new jobs. But wait,

42
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,283
what about the,

43
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,180
some technologists argue that the Internet
isn't innovation on a power with the

44
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:08,230
introduction of electricity.
If we go with this comparison,

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,930
we see how our modern innovation
differs from the old one.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,880
The Internet created new industries but
they're not creating enough jobs to keep

47
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,750
up with population growth or to compensate
for the industry as the Internet is

48
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,470
killing.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,470
At its peak in 2004 blockbuster had
84,000 employees and made 6 billion US

50
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:31,621
dollars in revenue in 2016 Netflix had
4,500 employees and made $9 billion in

51
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,100
revenue or take us for example,

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,960
with a full time team of just 12 people
courts cause angst reaches millions of

53
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:45,340
people. The TV station with
the same amount of viewers
needs way more employees.

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,230
Innovation in the information age doesn't
equate to the creation of enough new

55
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,390
jobs,
which would be bad enough on its own,

56
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,570
but now a new wave of automation and
a new generation of machines is slowly

57
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,684
taking over.

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,210
To understand this,
we need to understand ourselves first.

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,210
Human progress is based
on the division of Labor.

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,700
As we advanced over thousands of years,

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,250
our jobs became more and more specialized.

62
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,080
While even our smartest machines
are bad at doing complicated jobs.

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,880
They are extremely good at doing
narrowly defined and predictable tasks.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,580
This is what destroyed factory jobs,

65
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,260
but look at a complex job long and hard
enough and you'll find that it's ready.

66
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:36,430
Just many narrowly defined and
predictable tasks. One after another.

67
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Machines are on the brink of becoming so
good at breaking down complex jobs into

68
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,960
many predictable ones
that for a lot of people,

69
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,240
there will be no further
room to specialize.

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
We are on the verge of being out competed.

71
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,530
Digital machines do this
via machine learning,

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,430
which enables them to acquire
information and skills by analyzing data.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,300
This makes them become better at
something through the relationships they

74
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,700
discover machines teach themselves.

75
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,200
We make this possible by giving a
computer a lot of data about the thing we

76
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,020
wanted to become better at.
Show a machine,

77
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,130
all the things you bought online and it
will slowly learn what to recommend to

78
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,200
you so you buy more things.

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Machine learning is now meeting more of
its potential because in recent years

80
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,000
humans have started to
gather data about everything,

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,510
behavior, weather patterns, medical
records, communication systems,

82
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,680
travel data and of course
data about what we do at work.

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,970
What we've created by
accident is a huge library.

84
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:44,320
Machines can use to learn how humans
do things and learn to do them better.

85
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,190
These digital machines might be
the biggest job killer of all.

86
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,080
They can be replicated instantly
and for free when they improve.

87
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,630
You don't need to invest
in big metal things.

88
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,680
You can just use the new and they
have the ability to get better fast.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,320
How fast. If your work involves
complex work on a computer as a day,

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,040
you might be out of work even sooner
than the people who still have jobs in

91
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,874
factories.

92
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,980
There are actual real world examples of
how this transition might be happening.

93
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,300
A San Francisco company offers a
project management software for big

94
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,134
corporations,

95
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,060
which is supposed to eliminate middle
management positions when it's hard for a

96
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:26,870
new project.

97
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,310
The software first asides which jobs
can be automated and precisely where it

98
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:33,440
needs actual professional humans.

99
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,340
It then helps assemble a team of
freelancers over the Internet.

100
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,140
The software then distributes tasks to
the humans and controls the policy of the

101
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,830
work tracking individual performance
until the project is complete.

102
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,990
Okay, this doesn't sound too bad.
Well, this machine is killing one job.

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,830
It creates jobs for
freelancers, right? Well,

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,730
as the freelancers complete their
tasks, learning algorithms, trek them,

105
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,510
and gather data about their work
and which tasks it consists of.

106
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,980
So what's actually happening is that the
freelance is on teaching a machine how

107
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,140
to replace them.
On average,

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,320
this software reduces costs by about 50%
in the first year and by another 25% in

109
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:18,860
the second year.
This is only one example of many.

110
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,900
There are machines and programs getting
as good or better than humans in all

111
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,080
kinds of fields,
from pharmacists to analysts,

112
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,710
journalists to radiologists,
caches of bank tellers,

113
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,050
all the unskilled worker flipping burgers.

114
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,630
All of these jobs won't disappear over
night with fewer and fewer humans will be

115
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,380
doing them. We'll discuss a
few cases and a followup video,

116
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,610
but while jobs disappearing is bad,
it's only half of the story.

117
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,170
It's not enough to substitute
old jobs with new ones.

118
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,370
We need to be generating new jobs
constantly because the world population is

119
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:03,000
growing. In the past, we have
solved this through innovation,

120
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,510
but since 1973 the generation of new jobs
in the U S has begun to shrink and the

121
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,560
first decade of the 21st century who was
the first one where the total amount of

122
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:18,561
jobs in the u s did not grow for the
first time in a country that needs to

123
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:23,631
create up to 150,000 new jobs per month
just to keep up with population growth.

124
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,830
This is bad news.

125
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,550
This is also starting to
affect standards of living.

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,540
In the past it was seen as obvious
that with the rising productivity,

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,340
more and better jobs would be created,
but the numbers tell a different story.

128
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,120
In 1998 us workers worked a
total of 194 billion hours.

129
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,340
Over the course of the next 15 years,

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,520
their output increased by 42% but in
2013 the amount of hours worked by US

131
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:57,240
workers was 194 billion hours.

132
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,890
What this means is that despite
productivity growing drastically,

133
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,160
thousands of new businesses opening up
and the u s population growing by over 40

134
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,760
million, there was no growth at all in
the number of hours worked in 15 years.

135
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,230
At the same time,

136
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,060
wages for new university graduates and
the U s have been declining for the past

137
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,270
decade.

138
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,270
One up to 40% of new graduates are forced
to take on jobs that don't require a

139
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,234
degree.

140
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,520
Productivity is separating
from human labor.

141
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,140
The nature of innovation
in the information age is
different from everything we

142
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,070
encountered before.

143
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,810
This process started years ago
and there's already well underway.

144
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,330
Even without new disruptions like self
driving cars or robot accountants.

145
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,660
It looks like automation
is different this time.

146
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,960
This time the machines might really take
our jobs and our economies are based on

147
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:01,680
the premise that people consume, but if
fewer and fewer people have decent work,

148
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
who will be doing all the consuming?

149
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,820
Are we producing evermore cheaply only
to arrive at a point where too few people

150
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,821
can actually buy all our staff and
services all will the future see a tiny

151
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:19,200
minority of the cigarettes who own the
machines dominating the rest of us and

152
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,640
does our future ready has
to be that grim won't.

153
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,390
We were fairly dark in this video.

154
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,000
It's far from certain that
things will turn out negatively.

155
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,820
The information age and modern automation,

156
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,410
it could be a huge opportunity to change
human society and reduce poverty and

157
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,790
inequality drastically. It could be
a seminal moment in human history.

158
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,350
We'll talk about this potential and
possible solutions like a universal basic

159
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:43,860
income.

160
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,860
In part two of this video's areas we
need to think big and fast because one

161
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:55,050
thing's for sure the machines are
not coming. They are all ready here.

162
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,930
This video,

163
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,590
it took us about $900 to make and we'd
been working on it for over nine months.

164
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,580
Projects like this one would
not be possible without
your support on [inaudible]

165
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,160
dot com if you want to help us out and
get a personal codes cause I was bird in

166
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,980
return,
that would be really useful.

167
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,190
We based much of this video
on two very good books,

168
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,250
the rise of the robots and
the second machine age.

169
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,000
You can find links to both of them in the
video description. Highly recommended.

170
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,460
Also,
we made a little robot poster.

171
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,180
You can buy it and a lot of
other stuff in our DF. Tba Shot.

172
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,010
This video is part of a larger series
about how technology is already changing

173
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,550
and will change human life forever.
If you want to continue watching.

174
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,810
We have a few playlists.
