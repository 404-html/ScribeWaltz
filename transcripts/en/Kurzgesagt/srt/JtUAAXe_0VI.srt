1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,340
Can you trust zonked videos to answer
this question will first explain how we

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,380
research them and then talk
a bit about paths, videos,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,270
and where we want to
achieve with the channel.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,080
Making a cause out video always begins
with a question or an issue. For example,

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,280
after our meat video,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,460
many viewers asked about the
health effects of meat on humans.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,050
We had no idea and we're pretty curious
too, so we just decided to work on it.

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,360
The first step is research.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,280
We start by looking for
books and scientific papers
to get an overview and just

10
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:37,970
read a lot.
The plan is to find a story worth telling.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,190
Is there something surprising to learn?

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,810
Is there a larger context or a new
perspective or will it be an overview or

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,110
introduction?
Once we have the first readable version,

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,820
we reached out to experts or scientists
and ask them to fact check and correct

15
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,590
us.
Often enough,

16
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:58,130
they find a floor or pointers in the
direction of contradictory research.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,080
At this point, many scripts
dime. If our idea does hold up,

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,640
we continue working on this.
This process can take weeks or months.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,750
Our loneliness script, for example,
took over a year and a half to finish.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,250
The hardest part is being brief.
Well, not simplifying too much.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,730
It's much easier to write a
long scripts that are short one.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,770
When we're finally done,

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,580
we do another round of research and
show the Strip two experts. Again, IDD,

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,940
different ones than the ones we talked
to at the beginning of the process.

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,420
When we express an opinion,
we'd market as such.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,080
That's not saying that we don't
draw conclusions from the research.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,370
Homeopathy does not work and meat
is really bad for the planet.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Climate change is real, but organic
food is not a good way of solving it.

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,460
If the facts clearly support a conclusion,
it's okay to present it as such.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,730
Of course,
we can't always make everybody happy.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,110
People who know a lot about
a topic sometimes get annoyed
if we don't mention an

32
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:00,800
aspect they think is crucial or
when we omit technical terms.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,050
This is more or less unsolvable because
of the nature of our videos and scripts

34
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:10,850
have around 1,300 words, so there's
always some degree of simplification.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,840
You will always find the list of our
research and sources and further reading

36
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,430
material in the video description.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,050
Just citing sources doesn't make your work
accurate or your research good though,

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,220
so we encourage you to use our sources
document as a starting point to look at

39
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,870
the topic yourself and learn more.

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,070
But it would be dishonest to say
that we've always worked this way.

41
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,020
Some older videos don't live up to
the standards we set ourselves today.

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,550
The two that annoy us the most are
the refugee and addiction videos.

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,300
In both of them, we didn't try to
present a balanced perspective,

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,520
but instead chose a taken ran with it.

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,990
The refugee video was made with a deep
feeling of angry frustration about the

46
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:54,170
world and the high point
of the 2015 refugee crisis.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,060
While we argued over quotas, dead
children washed ashore and our coastlines.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,030
The stripped was resin on one Sunday
afternoon and illustrated and animated

49
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:08,020
within a week. It was exhausting,
stressful and frustrating.

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,650
We still believe it was the right
thing for European countries to help,

51
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,190
but it was absolutely
unnecessary to be toxic about it.

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,020
We insulted people and brushed away
their concerns about real and profound

53
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,854
challenges.

54
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,130
The video was divisive and emotional at
a time when the debate needed a calm and

55
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,100
clear overview.

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,260
The addiction video was based on only
one source that has amassed a lot of

57
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:37,180
criticism over the years and unfortunately
we did not reach out to scientists or

58
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:41,230
do extra research on the papers that
were the basis for the videos thesis.

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,370
That addiction is purely psychological
and based on the life circumstances of

60
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,204
the individual.

61
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,500
This dance is still held by a number of
addiction professionals and we're not

62
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,370
saying it's wrong,

63
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,260
but a lot of others disagree and it's
not correct to presented as the truth.

64
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,720
Addiction is far from solved.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,440
An hour video should have reflected
that instead of taking one side,

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,110
we simplified an idea so much that it
made a great story but became distorting.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Both videos were made over the span of
two months and they're two of our most

68
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:16,180
successful videos. To date, we had
found a formula that really works,

69
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,230
but we never made anything like them
again and have been discussing how to deal

70
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,780
with them for a long
time and it doesn't help.

71
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,060
The both videos are loved by many people.

72
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,340
We want to be proud of our work and
these two videos don't make us proud.

73
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,780
So today we deleted them.
It will purge them from the Internet,

74
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,930
but that's not the goal. Anyway.
Feel free to upload them elsewhere.

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,190
We're working on a new addiction video
that will take a look at the chemical and

76
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,430
psychological causes.
We'll take our sweet time with it,

77
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,470
so please have patience. The refugee
video is not up to date anymore,

78
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,000
so we will not renew it.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,660
We're also going through our
older videos to add sources,

80
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,830
further reading and comments in
the next few months. Nowadays,

81
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,110
rather than trusting in
mainstream institutions,

82
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,290
we often look at creators on the
Internet for reliable information.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,880
We rely on the fact that they're careful
and rigorous and not led by monetary

84
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,714
incentives,

85
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,070
and we expect them to acknowledge mistakes
in public and work to minimize them.

86
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
So this is what we're going to do.

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,070
Trust is not a thing you are
in once and then keep forever.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,900
You have to constantly work for it.

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,590
So can you trust courts because aren't
you can trust that every video we make is

90
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,200
30 research to and approved
by different experts.

91
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,430
You can trust that we know that we have
biases and we try to overcome them.

92
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,300
We want to move coats cause aren't
further towards the trustworthy end of the

93
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,134
spectrum.

94
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,040
The world is too complex for simple
answers and we don't want to be the ones

95
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:49,570
giving them. Making these videos over
the last six years has been quite a ride.

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,340
Now we're very grateful for us.

97
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,630
We hope you'll be with us for the next
few years to and join us on our journey

98
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:59,140
to figure out what this universe
and life stuff is all about.

99
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,940
Thank you for watching.

100
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,640
Okay.
