1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,970
Time make sense in small pieces,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,420
but when you look at
huge stretches of time,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,450
it's almost impossible to
wrap your head around things.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,370
So let's start small with
minutes, hours, days.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,620
You probably spent the last 24 hours
mostly sleeping and working with some

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,860
coffee in there somewhere.
Please watch less TV.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,930
Now let's look at 2013
relatively unnoticed.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,280
Hitler's bodyguard died at
the age of 96 Wallen in June.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,450
Edward Snowden started the NSA
scandal moving back a base.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,190
The 21st century is still pretty young
and largely shaped by the attacks on nine

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,270
11 that ultimately led
to the 30 rock wall.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,120
Oh and Facebook and smart
folks took over our lives,

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,200
but we just getting started.
Let's back up further.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,890
The 20th century has seen
its share of conflicts too.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,320
After two devastating world wars,

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,440
the Cold War lasted for almost
the whole second half of it.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,540
An average human lifespan covers most of
this stuff as well as the birth of the

18
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,090
Internet and the beginning
of the information age.

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,120
The oldest living person on earth is
currently miss how Alcala who was born in

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,210
1898 which means that her birth was closer
to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,793
current day.

22
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,870
The last 500 years of human
history brought enormous
changes to our lifestyles.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,890
Industrialization gave rise
to new ideas like communism.

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,510
Farmers became workers and knowledge
became easier to distribute.

25
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,530
The theory of evolution changed
how we saw ourselves and the world.

26
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:50,110
We live in a wall in a few hundred years.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,260
The 15th century was very eventful.

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,640
Columbus is discovery of America
and the fall of Constantinople.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,470
Mark the end of the Middle Ages. People
in the Middle Ages were super into war,

30
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,820
over territory and religion,

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,140
but the black plague was far more
efficient than war killing every third

32
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:12,160
European in six years
arriving in the common era.

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,230
Let's take a look where we came from.

34
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,140
Our current century is tiny
and 2013 is barely visible.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
This is recorded human history.

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,070
The pyramids were
constructed 4,500 years ago.

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,840
The peak of the Roman empire was
2000 years ago, so to the Romans,

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,900
the pyramids were as old as
the Romans are to us today.

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,900
History starts with writing,
but what happened before that?

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,190
About 12,000 years ago,
the agricultural revolution took place.

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,170
Mankind began farming,

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,440
which gave rise to the existence
of cities and larger communities.

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,220
The dominance of the human species over
planet Earth really started here 90,000

44
00:02:56,321 --> 00:03:00,670
years ago. Neanderthals and
humans coexist. Europe, fun fact,

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,200
this is roughly the time period a modern
space craft would need to reach the

46
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,080
nearest star.
Hello Sapiens,

47
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,500
the modern human evolved
200,000 years ago.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,870
Looking at all of human history, what we
call a d seems pretty small, doesn't it?

49
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,330
6 million years ago,

50
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,070
our ancestors and the modern chimpanzee
shared a common ancestor for the last

51
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,370
time and for 2.7 5 million years.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,770
Stone tools were all the rage,

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,950
a mere 65 million years ago,

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,160
the age of the dinosaurs and
it in an enormous explosion,

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,380
which paved the way for
the rise of mammals,

56
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,710
but the dinosaurs roamed the
earth for an incredibly long time.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Over 165 million years that so long that
it means that t rex that lived at 65

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,710
million years ago is closer to seeing a
live Miley Cyrus concert than to seeing

59
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:58,711
our life stegosaurus animal life on this
planet started 600 million years ago.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,440
The earliest animals were
fish and other small,

61
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,990
simple sea creatures then came insects,

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,860
then reptiles and finally
around 200 million years ago,

63
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,720
mammals joined the party.

64
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,320
Life itself began much farther back.

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,780
3.6 billion years ago
before any animals appeared,

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,640
there were 2.4 billion years when
life consisted only of tiny microbes,

67
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,140
countless at single cell
bacteria for 3 billion years.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,680
All life on earth was
invisible to the naked eye.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,050
It's hard to understand how single celled
organisms could develop into complex

70
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:42,640
life forms like fish or slots.
The answer is time.

71
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
A whole lot of type 2.4 billion years is
a lot of time to work with 4.6 billion

72
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,680
years ago, the son was born from
the remnants of a giant explosion.

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,630
60 million years later earth
formed in those early years.

74
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,010
Frequent bombardment by comets and
asteroids supplied the earth with large

75
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,200
oceans and a moon to send spaceships too.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,870
But as far as the whole universe goes,
our solar system is pretty new.

77
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,560
13.7 5 billion years ago,

78
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,320
the universe was born and
600 million years later,

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,840
our own galaxy formed
from billions of stars.

80
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,840
But what was before the big bag?

81
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,460
The truth is we don't know that
yet and maybe we never will,

82
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,770
but we gave it some colors, so at least
we have that and there you have it.

83
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,290
The past. Now let's take a look
at what we know about the future.

84
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,140
And roughly 1 billion years,

85
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,040
the sun will be so hot that life
on earth becomes impossible.

86
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,050
The death of the son, 4 billion years
later marks the end of the service system.

87
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,880
Okay? So no more soda system.
And what happens after that?

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,440
A few trillion years from now,

89
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:02,441
stock reduction will cease and one day
the last star in the universe will die.

90
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,760
The universe will turn dark,
inhabited only by black holes.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,970
Long after the last black
hole has evaporated,

92
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,040
our universe reaches its final stage.
Something called heat death.

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,140
Nothing changes anymore.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,980
The Universe is dead forever.

95
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,730
Now you're feeling some
pretty weird feelings right
now, aren't you? We are too.

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,010
It's only natural.
The good news is this is all far,

97
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:34,844
far away.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,240
The only time that actually matters is
now that cute girl you like Oscar out

99
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,300
time is precious.
Make it count.
