1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,060
Dave, the last star will die and
the universe will turn dark forever.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,380
It will probably be a red dwarf,
a tiny kind of start.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,580
That's also one of our best bet is to
find alien life and might be the last home

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,580
of humanity before the
university becomes uninhabitable.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,080
So what do we know about them
and why are they our last hope?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,630
At least 70% of stars in
the universe are red dwarfs.

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,730
They are the tiniest stars out there with
only about seven to 50% of the mass of

8
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:45,260
our sun, not that much bigger than our
planet Jupiter, which is still huge.

9
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:47,930
Though they are also very dim.

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,600
It's impossible to see
them with the naked eye.

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,980
You've never seen one in the night sky.
Even with all our technology,

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,920
we can only clear the observe.
Red Dwarfs in our neighborhood,

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,550
approximately 20 of the 30 stars close
to Earth are red dwarfs like all stars.

14
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,440
Red Dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,610
But while more massive stars accumulate
all the fuse helium in there,

16
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,100
cause red dwarfs stay convective,

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,250
meaning that the helium and
hydrogen constantly mix,

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,690
so they use up their fuel incredibly
slowly before they're extinguished.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Red Dwarfs burn so slowly that that
average lifespan is between one and 10

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,550
trillion years.
By comparison,

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,710
the Sun will survive for another 5 billion
years because the university is only

22
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,050
13.7 5 billion years old.

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,260
Not a single red dwarf has reached
a later development stages.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,370
Every single one of the trillions
that exist is still a baby.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,020
Speaking of babies,

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,870
the smallest star and the entire universe
is also a red wolf because small red

27
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:52,640
dwarfs are right on the
verge of being a star at all,

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,580
just a tiny bit less
hydrogen and they own bear.

29
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,840
Brown dwarfs failed stars that cannot
sustain a fusion reaction for long.

30
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,130
So what about aliens or
a new home for humanity?

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,910
Since our son will die one day will
eventually need to look for a new home and

32
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:13,430
where there are habitable planet,
there might also be aliens.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,260
The Kepler space observatory found that
at least half of all red dwarfs host

34
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:21,590
rock planet between half and
four times the mass of our earth.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,530
Many of them are in the habitable zone,

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,350
the area around a style
where water can be liquid,

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,280
but since red dwarves Burnet
relatively cold temperatures,

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,130
that would need to be really
close to be hospitable,

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,850
probably as close as mercury
to our son or even closer,

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,740
which brings with it all kinds
of problems. For example,

41
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,440
a planet this close to a style
would probably be tidally locked,

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,780
meaning the same side
would always face it.

43
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,980
This side would be incredibly hot
while the shadow side would be frozen,

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,910
which makes it hard for life to develop
all new.

45
00:02:55,911 --> 00:03:00,070
A planet with a big enough ocean might
be able to distribute this energy and

46
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,750
create some kind of stability.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,970
All the gravitational forces at the red
dwarf could squeeze the canister and

48
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,120
heated up so much, but it might
lose all its water. Over time,

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,530
these planets could end up like Venus,
a hot burning hell.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,760
Another problem is that many red
wolves vary in their energy output.

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,540
They can be covered in
star spots that condemned.

52
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,950
They're emitted light
by up to 40% for months,

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,730
which would cause oceans on planets
to freeze over at other times.

54
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,210
They can emit powerful solar flares,
sudden outbursts of energy,

55
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,410
incredibly powerful. These red dwarfs
can double their brightness in minutes,

56
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,220
which could strip away sizeable portions
of a planet's atmosphere and burn it,

57
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,120
rendering it sterile. On the other
hand, they're extremely long.

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,530
Lifespan is a big plus.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,180
A red dwarf with just moderate levels of
activity could be an amazing place for

60
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,560
a pennant and hosts life.

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,380
Life on earth has existed for about 4
billion years and we have about a billion

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,100
years left before the sun becomes so hard
that complex life on earth will become

63
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:04,540
impossible. We will either die out or
leave earth and look for a new hope.

64
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,070
We could build a civilization
for potentially trillions
of years around a red

65
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:13,960
dwarf with the right conditions. About
5% of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way.

66
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:18,961
May host habitable roughly earth sized
planets that would be more than 4 billion

67
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,110
in total, but life may not
even need a planet like earth.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,540
Candidates for life around a red dwarf,

69
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,260
maybe the moons of gas giants
also called super earths ready,

70
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,870
massive rocky planets.
All in all,

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,340
there are an estimated 60 billion
potentially habitable planets around red

72
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,160
dwarves,
and that's in the Milky Way alone.

73
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,720
So wolves might become really important
for our survival in the future,

74
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,270
but everything has to die at some point.

75
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,930
Even red dwarfs when
in trillions of years,

76
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,960
the life of the last Red Dwarf in
the university is about to end.

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,250
It will not be a very spectacular event.
As it's hundred runs,

78
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,230
outage shrinks becoming a blue dwarf,

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,230
burning out completely
after it's fueled is spent.

80
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,670
It's transformed into a white dwarf and
object about as smart as earth packed,

81
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:11,230
very densely and made of degenerate gases,
mostly of helion for nuclei.

82
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,420
Having no more source of energy,

83
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,250
it will cool extremely slowly
over trillions of years
until it becomes its final

84
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,540
format.
A cold,

85
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,860
blank dwarf white and Black Two offs are
so fascinating that they deserve their

86
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,570
own video anyway.

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,080
It's going to be a long time before the
last stars in the universe of vanish.

88
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,220
It's kind of uplifting to know that if
humanity succeeds in venturing into space,

89
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,850
we have plenty of time before the
universe turns out the lights,

90
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,270
