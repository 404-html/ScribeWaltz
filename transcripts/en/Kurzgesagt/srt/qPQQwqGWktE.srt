1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,090
It's hard to get to space.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,550
As much as we all wish there were an easy
and affordable way to see how pennant

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:10,140
of floating in the dark.
Right now,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,170
the only way is to become an
astronaut or a billionaire,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,670
but there is a concept that might make
it possible while serving as the starting

6
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:21,000
point for the exploration of the universe,
the space elevator.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,950
How exactly does it work

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,060
to understand how a space
elevator will get us into space?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,220
We must first understand wasn't always
as being in [inaudible] basically means

10
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,460
falling towards something,
but moving fast enough to mess.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,620
If you throw a ball on earth,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,970
it makes an arc through the APP
and then hits the ground in space.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,380
Gravity makes you move much the same way,
but if you move sideways fast enough,

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,160
the curvature of the earth makes the
ground fall away beneath you as fast as

15
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:03,450
gravity pulls you towards it.
So to enter Earth's or bears,

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,600
rockets have to go up and sideways fast.

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,790
By contrast,

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,690
a space elevator taps into energy from
the earth's rotation to get the cargo

19
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,524
going fast.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,570
Imagine a child spinning a tie on a
rope with an ant on the chance hand.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,850
As the aunt climbs out along the rope,

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,980
it starts to move faster and faster
as it ascends compared to rockets.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,900
With cargo launched on an elevator,

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,230
you only need to provide
the energy to go up fast.

25
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,810
Solid ways movement comes free
with the Earth's rotation,

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,520
but a space elevator would without a
doubt be the single largest and most

27
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:42,810
expensive structure ever built by humans.
So is it worth it?

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,300
It all comes down to costs.

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,830
Rockets been a huge amount of rocket
fuel just to get a small amount of cargo

30
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,900
into space.
At current prices,

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,920
it costs about $20,000 to about
one kilogram of payload into space.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,990
That's one point $3 million for the
average human, $40 million for your car,

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,660
billions for an
international space station,

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,310
this immense cost is one of the major
limitations of human space flight.

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,320
Even with advancing technology,

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,890
there's cost isn't likely to be comparable
with the price of an airline ticket

37
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:14,724
anytime soon,

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,020
a space elevator would solve
this problem after construction.

39
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,120
A space that of Acer is protected to
reduce the cost 100 fold to $200 per

40
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:28,560
kilogram effort. Inexpensive
space elevator costs, $20 billion.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,720
Then we'll recoup our losses after
launching only 1 million tons close to the

42
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,880
weight of two ends
national space stations.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,270
So what would a space elevator
look like in real life?

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
A space elevator has
four major components.

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,990
The Tata anchor counterweight and climate.

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,950
The elevator part of the space in a
visa is the [inaudible] and the climate.

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,650
It extends from the surface
of the earth to space.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,650
The climate is like a
conventional elevator carriage.

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,900
A chamber that works its way up and down.

50
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:01,900
The tether at the base would be an
anchor pinning the tethered to the earth

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,790
along with a port for climbers.

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
At the top is the counterweight
which holds up the tether.

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,410
The tether is held tight like a rope
and supported from above by the tension

54
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,880
from the counterweight located higher
than 36,000 kilometers above the earth's

55
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,880
surface. At the counterweight
could be a space station,

56
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,480
a launching point for all missions
from the spaceport innovator.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,200
But can we actually build one?
It's hard to say.

58
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,550
The biggest challenge is the tether.
It needs to be light, affordable,

59
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,340
and more stable than any
material we can produce.

60
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:38,050
Right now there are promising materials
like graphene and Diamond Nana threads,

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,760
but even they may not be strong enough
and aside from being incredibly strong,

62
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,970
the tether would also have to
withstand atmospheric corrosion,

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,620
radiation and micrometeorites
and debris impacts. Additionally,

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,030
it takes several days to climb the
elevator. How do we power the climber?

65
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,610
It requires a lot of energy to go up.

66
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,920
Do we need a nuclear reactor on our
elevator carriage or do we beam at power

67
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:06,880
from the ground with a super powered laser
and where do we get the raw materials

68
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,040
for a 36,000 kilometer long tether?

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,540
Do we make it on earth and launch it
into space or do we make it in space and

70
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:18,490
lower it down to the earth? Could astroid
mining with the answer put simply.

71
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,560
There are still some major technological
hurdles to overcome and a space

72
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,460
elevator is not without risk.
Should the had a break,

73
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,340
it would collapse in spectacular
style. If it breaks me, the anchor,

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,090
the force exerted by the counterweights
will cause the entire elevator to rise

75
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,510
up ascending into space.
Should it break near the counterweight,

76
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,680
the tether will fall.

77
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,940
Wrapping around the world and whipping
the end of the resulting debris in always

78
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,770
could pose serious problems
to future space light.

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,170
If we build a space elevator on earth,
we have to do it right the first time.

80
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,640
For these reasons,

81
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,240
some experts have proposed first
building a space elevator on the moon.

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,910
The moon's gravity is much
weaker than the earth,

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,170
so a flimsier but exist in material
like Kevlar could serve as a tether.

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,390
Even with all these challenges,

85
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,510
the payoff of having a working
space elevator would be a maths.

86
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,950
It might be the first step to truly
becoming a space fairing civilization.

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,240
Maybe we will never build a space
innovator, but in trying to do so,

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,250
we might learn an awful lot and when it
comes to the exploration of the universe,

89
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,070
there can't be too many dreams.
Have a glorious future.
