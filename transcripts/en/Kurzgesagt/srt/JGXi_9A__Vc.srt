1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,620
Planet Earth is the home of every
life form known to us in the universe.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,070
It's age is about a third of the age of
the universe and admitted it is a thing

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,094
of beauty.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,780
The slightly squash there with a heavy
metal core and a lighter surface crust

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,860
wrapped in a fence. Lever of sweet
attar breeze with fast oceans,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,600
fertile plains, magnificent
mountains, freshwater rivers, streams,

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:29,250
lakes and aquifers orbiting a star,
which warms us and gives us energy.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,230
But how did our hope come into
existence and what's it made of?

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,620
4.6 billion years ago,

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,670
earth was created from the remnants of
dead stars that collected in a giant

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,720
dirty gas cloud.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,220
The gas cloud became denser in its
center and formed the accretion desk.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,230
Small particles started clumping together
and building larger and larger objects

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,050
until they formed the objects
we call planets. Today.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,390
This process took 10 to 20 million years
and is still not very well understood

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,260
that about this time when the
solar system was young and chaotic,

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,820
a giant objects about as big
as Mars collided with our home.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,180
The impact was violent and if
the object had been more massive,

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,740
it might have destroyed earth.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Material from Earth was smashed
out into orbit and formed the moon,

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,570
which is the biggest satellite in relation
to its planet in the solar system.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,870
At this time,
earth was a hot hell,

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,460
constantly being hit by asteroids with
seas of lava and a toxic atmosphere,

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,180
but something was about to change
drastically. Earth cooled down.

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,150
Water from the inside of
the earth wandered to the
surface and rains down on us

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,790
only to vaporize again.
Advocacy clouds,

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,570
millions of asteroids brought
more and more water to our planet.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,580
All the water on earth has about
this volume compared to earth.

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,980
Today, the surface of earth
is 71% water and 29% land.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
97.5% is silane water,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,710
while only 2.5% is fresh water.

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,370
The fresh water is 69% ice and snow,

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,670
30% our ground waters and only about
1% make up the remaining groundwater's,

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,040
but even this small part is mostly frozen.

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,170
Only a tiny part of our water is actually
lakes and rivers and an even tinier

36
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:30,171
part is bound in living things so
gradually the earth cooled down and the

37
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,040
surface formed a thin crust,

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,780
but inside the earth hot rock continue
to swell about moving the cross from

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,460
below and breaking it apart.

40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,440
This process is called plate
tectonics and is happening right now.

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,950
We'll make a whole video about
it in the future. For now,

42
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,370
let's just say that the crust of Earth
consists of separate Joan plates that

43
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,230
move around as they meet,

44
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:57,231
they crumble and create mighty mountains
or violently plunged back down deeper

45
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,440
into earth,
creating deep trenches.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,230
That's the way the highest
place on earth was formed.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,030
Mount Everest and the deepest, the
Mariana trench. From our perspective,

48
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,000
earth's mountains and
trenches are mighty in deed,

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,310
but when you look at the
earth in cross section,

50
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,900
you can see how tiny they actually are.
The part we stand on is the crust,

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,610
which is about 50 kilometers thick.

52
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,420
Though it can vary between five
and 70 kilometers. By the way,

53
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:27,421
the deepest hole ever drilled by man is
12.262 kilometers deep up to the cross,

54
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,623
come to the mantle.

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,160
It's a silicate rocky shell and
about 2,900 kilometers thick.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,580
The mental consists of the upper
mantel and the lower mantle.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,570
The upper mantle has different
regions too. It's upper part,

58
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,480
which is a viscous and carers.
The crust is called the lithosphere.

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,190
After that there comes the asthenosphere
which consists of less mobile,

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,570
mostly solid material.

61
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,530
The lower mantle reaches deep
down to the outer core of earth.

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,920
Earth's outer core is a liquid
layer of iron and nickel,

63
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,070
about 2,266 kilometers thick.

64
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
Temperatures vary from 4,000
degrees Celsius to 5,700
degrees Celsius and in the

65
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,420
center is the inner core.
It's mostly solid.

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,220
The ball made of an iron nickel alloy
with a radius of about 1200 kilometers,

67
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,870
70% the size of the moon, and about the
temperature of the surface of the Simon.

68
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,820
It is slowly growing as an estimated
rate of about one millimeter per year.

69
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,860
Now for some perspective,

70
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,290
this small layer of crystallized milk
products of former molten metal is where

71
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,890
we live.
Then there's earth's magnetic field.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,020
It's an invisible phenomenon.

73
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,960
The diverts high energy particles coming
from the sun and other sources and

74
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:45,940
knowing for a stable environment with
comparatively little radiation impact on

75
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,150
earth, but why is it there? Actually,

76
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,340
we don't really know a
terrible lot about that.

77
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,570
We know it has something to do with
the core of the earth inside this metal

78
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:59,050
sphere. Large electrical currents
flow in complicated patterns.

79
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,850
They cause a magnetic field that sort of
stabilizes itself according to the laws

80
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:07,870
of electrodynamics.
This entire system is called the dynamo,

81
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,350
but don't let us fool you into
thinking we have it all figured out.

82
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,620
Speaking of breathtaking information,

83
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,820
what's about the airy stuff
that surrounds us by volume?

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,920
Dry Air consists mostly of
nitrogen, oxygen, Argon, carbon,

85
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,520
a variable amount of water vapor
and small amounts of other gases.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,200
Humans are very dependent on the lowest
layer of the atmosphere. The troopers,

87
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,040
fair weather, weather is it's
12 kilometers thick on average.

88
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,270
Above that is the stratosphere, which is
where the ozone layer protects us from.

89
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,410
The Sun's most aggressive type of light.
Above that is the Mesosphere,

90
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,060
the coolest place on earth with an average
temperature around minus 85 degrees

91
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:53,650
Celsius. As about 80 kilometers
up the thermosphere starts.

92
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,220
The transition to space is a
fluent one without clear borders,

93
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,850
but Schumann's decided that space
starts here at about 100 kilometers.

94
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,020
Earth stops and space begins though the
atmosphere extends a bit further in this

95
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,590
region,
we find the ion is fair.

96
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,080
The Aurora borealis and the ISS and
the outermost layer is the exosphere

97
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,600
stretching up to 10,000 kilometers.

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,770
It merges fluidly without a space
where there's no atmosphere at all.

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,480
The atoms and molecules in this area
are so far apart that they can travel

100
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,350
hundreds of kilometers without
colliding with each other. Okay.

101
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,880
Humans in their present form have
only been around for 200,000 years.

102
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,920
That 0.004% of Earth's history,
not non really,

103
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,230
and here we are now living in a thin,
moist layer on a small wet rock.

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,210
We call this rug earth.

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,870
It is the product to the
university's deepest workings.

106
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,140
The result of the constant process of
creation and destruction happening all

107
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,710
over the universe all the time,

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,090
helped by chance the laws of
the universe and random events.

109
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,130
We are really lucky.
