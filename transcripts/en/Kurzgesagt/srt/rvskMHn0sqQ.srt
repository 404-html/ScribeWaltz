1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,880
Until recently the vast majority of the
world population worked on farms and the

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,470
total production of the world's economy
was mostly the total agricultural output

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,820
and this output, it was limited
by the fixed size of the land.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,470
The total output of the economy
did not change a lot year by year.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,440
The size of the pie was fixed.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,030
The world was a zero sum game
in such a stagnating world,

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,810
the only way to get better off is
if someone else gets worse off.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,760
If you take a bigger piece of the pie,
someone else's get smaller.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,760
If you want more food than conquering,

10
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,280
plundering and stealing
our great strategies,

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,980
your neighbor's loss is your gain.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,610
This was the state of things
for thousands of years.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,670
Society's invaded each other
constantly to get more pie.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,180
Economic inequality was extreme.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,250
Some had all the pie they wanted while
others who had to live with the crumbs.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,230
Then the industrial revolution
happened and everything changed.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,460
We developed machinery, better
crops, better fertilizers.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,170
Agricultural output skyrocketed,
but we didn't just produce more food.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,340
Every industrial set to explode.

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,350
In terms of productivity from 1700 to
1870 the production of iron in Britain

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,300
increased 137 fold.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,820
The industrial revolution led
to a previously unimaginable
increase in economic

23
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,654
output.

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,140
This altered the nature of our society's
economic growth changed the world from

25
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,850
a zero sum game to a positive sum game.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
We had found a way to create a bigger pie,
but not only a bigger pie,

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,070
but a pie that was growing bigger each
year. More people could have more.

28
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,270
At the same time, this development
is spreading and continuing today.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,620
Antibiotics kill bacteria. Our plans
deliver energy. Cell phones connect us.

30
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,850
Planes let us travel
cheaply. Fridges, store food.

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,380
Continuous progress in all sectors of
the economy seems normal to us today,

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,100
but the change from stagnation to economic
growth really was the most drastic

33
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,960
shift in human history.
How was this possible?

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,480
At the very core of this
massive transformation
stand new ideas that lead to

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,080
innovation.
Innovation has many different definitions,

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,970
but in the context of this video,

37
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,590
we mean better solutions to existing
problems and solutions to problems we

38
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:35,130
didn't know we had.
The more you innovate,

39
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,230
the more complex and interesting problems
you discover as your wishes and needs

40
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,064
evolve.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,440
The average citizen in Norway 250 years
ago might have wanted some really good

42
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:51,180
shoes. 150 years ago, maybe
a bicycle 80 years ago,

43
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,500
a car 30 years ago,
cheap air travel and so on.

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,650
Once we get what we want,
we don't stop.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,560
We can see how we can improve things
even more and how to make things even

46
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,840
better.
The new positive,

47
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:09,841
some world has existed for 0.1% of human
history and we have yet to get used to

48
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,080
it.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
It has a consequence that feels really
unintuitive in a positive song world.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,820
It's in your personal selfish,

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,840
best interest that every human
on planet earth is well off.

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,370
It's good for you.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,420
If people in obscure parts of countries
you've never heard of are prospering,

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,260
there is a genuine selfish argument
for making the world a better place.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,460
In a positive sum world,
the more people are well off,

56
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,440
the better your own life is.

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,770
This is because of the
nature of innovation.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
It is fundamentally driven
by supply and demand.

59
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,420
The supply increases when more people
have the freedom and education to

60
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,800
contribute. They become
inventors, researchers, engineers,

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,080
or thinkers that come up with new ideas.

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,050
The demand Friday's increases.

63
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,020
As people get richer and
can pay for new solutions,

64
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,770
they increase the size of
the market for innovations.

65
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,290
Innovation follows incentives,

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,460
so naturally if many people want
to and can pay for something,

67
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,040
it will get the innovators
attention and energy.

68
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,950
Improving the lives of those who are
worst off has a multiplying effect.

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,370
It increases demand for ideas while at
the same time making it easier for ideas

70
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:35,110
to be produced. Let's take an example that
interests all of us. A cure for cancer.

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,070
If there are 1 billion people in the
world that have the wealth to pay for

72
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,010
cancer treatments innovation,
we'll follow this demand.

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,970
So hundreds of billions of dollars
have been invested in medical research.

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,890
This had a huge effect,

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,850
but we're still nowhere near to
curing all forms of cancer today.

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,660
Every sick person in the world dies of
cancer and you might be one of them.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
Now,
imagine if demand were higher.

78
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,340
Imagine instead of 1 billion people
being able to pay for a cure for cancer,

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,040
there were 4 billion or 7 billion.

80
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,870
Imagine how far medicine
could have developed if we
didn't invest it seven times

81
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:14,200
as much in curing cancer.
On top of that,

82
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,410
there's so much human potential
being wasted right now.

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,910
The work of a poor farmer in a
developing nation is not useful to you,

84
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,830
but if he becomes better off,

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,330
his children might spend that time in
the university developing things that are

86
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,164
useful to you.

87
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,310
Instead of having some hotspots of
innovation in the developed world,

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,220
we would have many hotspots
all over the world.

89
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,380
The research output of humanity would
be many times what it is right now.

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,100
Could we have cured cancer by now?
If that were the case,

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,430
well maybe if we spent seven times as
much on research had seven times as many

92
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,860
people working on this and the
global network of medical research,

93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,610
things would certainly be further ahead
than they are now and this is the core

94
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,910
of the argument. The more people
want the same thing that you want,

95
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,890
the more likely you are to get it.

96
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,940
That is what it means to
live in a positive sum world.

97
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,680
You didn't gain more piaf
poor places staple. Instead,

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,650
you get more pie.
If Paul places get richer,

99
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,770
contribute ideas and grow the global pie.

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
She likes space travel.

101
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,520
Imagine they were billions of people
in Africa and Asia with their own space

102
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:29,990
programs and demand for satellites
and moon bases and cities on Mars.

103
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,030
Do you like being alive?

104
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,710
A few billion people paying for medical
research could literally save your life.

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,000
It's in your interest for people
around the world to become better off.

106
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,590
The faster we get to this version of the
world, the better for you personally,

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,230
no matter what your motivation is,

108
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,410
working on a better world
is a very good thing to do.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,110
