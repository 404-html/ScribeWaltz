1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,480
Imagine a future where your toaster
anticipates what kind of toast you want

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,100
during the day. It scans the Internet
for new and exciting types of toast.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,600
Maybe it asks you about your day and
wants to chat about new achievements in

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,560
toast technology.
At what level would it become a person?

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,020
At which point will you ask yourself if
your toaster has feelings, if it did,

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,620
would unplug it,
be murdered and would you still own it?

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,790
Will we someday be forced
to give our machines rights?

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,030
Ai is already all around you.

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,210
It makes sure discounters are
stocked with enough snacks.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,110
It serves you up just the right Internet
ad and you may have even read a new

11
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,300
story written entirely by a machine.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,760
Right now we look at chat bots like Siri
and laugh at their primitive simulation

13
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,594
emotions,

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,860
but it's likely that we will have to deal
with beings that make it hard to draw

15
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,680
the line between real
and simulated humanity.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,880
Are there any machines in
existence that deserve rights?

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,490
Most likely not yet, but if they
come we are not prepared for it.

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,900
Most of the philosophy of rights is
ill equipped to deal with the case of

19
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,190
artificial intelligence.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,410
Most claims for right with a human or
animal are centered around the question of

21
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,660
consciousness.
Unfortunately,

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,650
nobody knows what consciousness
is something that it's immaterial.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,980
Others say it's a state of
matter like gas or liquid.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,040
Regardless of the precise definition,

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,270
we have an intuitive knowledge of
consciousness because we experience it.

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,070
We are aware of ourselves and our
surroundings and know what unconsciousness

27
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,904
feels like.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,310
Some neuroscientists believe that any
sufficiently advanced system can generate

29
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,180
consciousness, so if your toast
is hardware was powerful enough,

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,010
it may become self aware. If it
does what it deserve. Rights,

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,181
well,

32
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:11,181
not so fast would what we define as
rights make sense to as consciousness

33
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,560
entitles beings to have rights because
it gives a being the ability to suffer.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,120
It means the ability to not only
feel pain but to be aware of it.

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Robots don't suffer and they probably
won't unless we programmed them to without

36
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,830
pain or pleasure. There's no
preference and rights are meaningless.

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,510
Our human rights are deeply
tied to our own programming.

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,280
For example, we dislike pain because
our brains evolved to keep us alive,

39
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,900
to stop us from touching a hot fire.
Automakers runaway from predators,

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,730
so we came up with a rights that protect
us from infringements that causes pain.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,010
Even more abstract rights like freedom
are rooted in the way our brains are

42
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,920
wired to detect what is fair and unfair.

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,240
What a toaster that is unable to
move mind being locked in a cage.

44
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,080
Would it mind being dismantled
if it had no fear of death?

45
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,580
Would it mind being insulted if
it had no need for self esteem?

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,730
But what if we programmed a robot to
feel pain and emotions to prefer justice

47
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,000
over injustice, pleasure over
pain, and be aware of it?

48
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,100
Would that make them sufficiently human?
Many technologies,

49
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:30,130
it's belief that an explosion in
technology will occur when artificial

50
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,680
intelligence can learn
and create their own.

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,540
Artificial intelligence is even
smarter than themselves at this point.

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,590
The question of how robots are programmed
will be largely out of our control

53
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:42,951
water.

54
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:46,840
If an artificial intelligence found it
necessary to program the ability to feel

55
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,400
pain just as evolutionary biology found
it necessary. In most loving creatures.

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,100
Do.
Robots deserve those rights,

57
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,420
but maybe we should be less worried
about the risk that's superintelligent

58
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,110
robots post to us and more worried
about the danger we posed to them.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,210
Our whole human identity is based
on the idea of human exceptionalism,

60
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,770
that we are special, unique snowflakes
in titled to dominate the natural world.

61
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,750
Humans have a history of denying that
other beings are capable of suffering as

62
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,750
they do.
In the midst of the scientific revolution,

63
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,160
many to cart argued that animals were
mayor. Automata robots, if you will,

64
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,810
as such,

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,740
injuring a rabbit was about as morally
repugnant as punching a stuffed animal

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,130
and many of the greatest
crimes against humanity.

67
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,090
We're justified by their perpetrators on
the grounds that the victims were more

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,740
animal than civilized human.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,440
Even more problematic is that we have
an economic interest in denying robot

70
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,274
rights.

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,170
If we can coerce a sentient AI possibly
through programs torture into doing as

72
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,170
we please the economic
potential is unlimited.

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,240
We've done it before or after all
violence has been used to force our fellow

74
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:02,500
humans into working and we've never had
trouble coming up with an ideological

75
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,490
justifications.

76
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,140
Slave owners argued that
slavery benefited the slaves.

77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,230
They put a roof over their head
and taught them. Christianity.

78
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,210
Men who were against women voting argued
that it was in women's own interest to

79
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,920
leave the hard decisions to men.

80
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,590
Farmers argued that looking after animals
and feeding them justifies that early

81
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,420
death for our dietary preferences.

82
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,320
If robots become sentient,

83
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,920
there will be no shortage of arguments
for those who say that they should remain

84
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:36,370
without rights, especially from
those who stand to profit from it.

85
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,070
Artificial intelligence raises serious
questions about philosophical boundaries.

86
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,600
While we may ask if sent in, robots
aren't conscious or deserving of rights,

87
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,560
it forces us to pose basic
questions like what makes us human,

88
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,020
what makes us deserving of rights,

89
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,880
regardless of what we think the question
need to be resolved in the near future.

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,200
What are we going to do with robots?
Start demanding bear own rights.

91
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,290
What can robots to mining
rights teach us about ourselves?

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,070
Our friends at wisecrack made a
video exploring this very question,

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,160
using the philosophy of
Westworld wisecrack dissects
pop culture and a unique

94
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,940
and philosophical way.
