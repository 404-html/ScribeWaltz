1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,420
How big is the moon in the night sky?

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:07,410
The moon seems rather small,
but in reality it really isn't.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,140
Central Europe would easily fit under it.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,760
The surface area of the moon is huge.
To give you some perspective,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,200
it's as big as the whole European
continent. China, the USA, Brazil,

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,730
and South Africa together.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,560
Weight-Wise the moon is only about
one 18 month of the massive earth,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,550
but how big is it in relation
to earth? Quite big. Actually.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,500
Our Moon is the biggest in the solar
system and relation to its planet and it's

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,110
the fifth largest moon
in the solar system.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,670
Quite a bit bigger than the Dwarf
Planet Pluto. Now, if the mood is ready,

12
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,650
that huge. How far away is it from us
to seem this small in the night sky?

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,540
370 kilometers. As far
as the ISS, maybe no.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,920
At that distance,

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,010
gravitational forces would rip the
moon apart at 36,000 kilometers.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,840
It would be as far away as
our most distant satellites.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,760
That's adjust the distance to
reality pretty far away, right?

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,660
A seven, four, seven would need 28
straight days to fly to the moon.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,610
And even with our current technology,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,890
we'd need two full days
and in a car a lot of time.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,580
So how big is the moon?
Well,

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,160
it kind of depends how you define beg,

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,660
but seriously though,
it's pretty big.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,620
He Youtube,
we'll try something new this month.

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,820
Moon may one video about pool
Boone stuff each Monday in May.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,500
So see you next week.
