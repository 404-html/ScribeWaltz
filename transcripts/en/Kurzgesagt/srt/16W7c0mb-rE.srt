1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,130
An end is pretty stupid. It doesn't
have much of a brain, no. Well,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,030
no clan and yet many ants together.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,860
A smart an ant colony can
construct complex structures.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,510
Some colonies keep farms of Funky,
others take care of cattle.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,550
They can wage war or defend themselves.
How is this possible?

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,780
How can a bunch of stupid
things do smart things together?

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,060
This phenomenon is called immersions
and it's one of the most fascinating and

8
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,960
mysterious features of our universe.
In a nutshell.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,760
It describes small things forming bigger
things that have different properties

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,170
than the sum of their parts.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Emergence is complexity arising from
simplicity and immersions is everywhere.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,250
Water has a vastly different properties
to the molecules that make it up like

13
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,930
the concept of wetness, teak, wet
fabric. If you zoom in far enough,

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,460
there is no wetness.

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,360
There are just molecules sitting in the
spaces between the atoms of the cloth.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,690
Wetness is an emerging property of water,

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,940
something new only created by a lot of
individual interactions between water

18
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:28,941
molecules and this is sort of as many
things interact under a certain set of

19
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,880
rules, creating something
above and beyond themselves.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
It turns out that more is different.

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,010
This different property is itself a new
thing and that new thing can couple with

22
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:43,380
other new things to repeat the process.

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,770
You can imagine this as layers
at stacked upon each other.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,630
Every layer made from more
complex parts osms four molecules,

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,200
molecules form proteins.
Proteins make up cells,

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,860
cells make up organs,
organs form individuals,

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,110
individuals form societies,

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,860
but how can something be more
than the sum of its parts?

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,670
How do ams formed the sort
of cloudy entity that is a
colony by following a rule

30
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,850
set of the producers order through chaos.
For example,

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,670
let's look at how an ant
colony distributes jobs.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,860
Let's assume that a colonies should
have 25% workers, 25% cat acres,

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,040
25% soldiers and 25% gatherers
and communicate their
current job via chemicals.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,560
For example, a worker and constantly
secretes chemicals that say, I'm a worker.

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,130
When ants meet other ants, they smashed
each other to gather information,

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,460
telling each other their
job and what they are doing.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,280
Both keep track of who
they met in the past.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,270
Now imagine an anteater
kills most of the cataracts.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,900
If this isn't fixed quickly,
the colony will staff.

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,810
Many work arounds need to switch jobs,

41
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,380
but how do you tell this to
thousands of them? Simple. You don't.

42
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,340
Our work around tool still meet
her, the smell, other ants,

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,160
but it will encounter
almost new gatherers at all.

44
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,650
It's counts too few gatherers until it
reaches a critical point and then it

45
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,310
changes its job.
The worker becomes a gatherer.

46
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,490
Other ants will do the
same until after a while.

47
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,990
There are enough gather as again,
the balance is restored all by itself.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,600
The actions and interactions
of an individual are random.
You can't plan which,

49
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,160
and we'll encounter which other ENT,

50
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,970
but the simple set of rules is
so elegant that are colonies.

51
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:38,971
Many operations emerged as a consequence
on an even more fundamental level,

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,380
hundreds of millions of
complicated molecules interact
to maintain a robust and

53
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,850
amazing structure of being with vastly
different properties than the sum of its

54
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,830
dead parts emerges. The
smallest unit of life, the cell.

55
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,980
We still don't have a clear
definition of what living things are.

56
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,010
We just know the emerged from
things that are not alive.

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,160
Cells combine and cooperate.

58
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,430
They specialize and respond to one another
and over time we develop into complex

59
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,540
organisms with remarkable capacities.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Your arms and legs and heart are an
incredibly complex and complicated system

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,340
made of trillions of individual
stupid things and yet we read,

62
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,130
digest and watch youtube videos.

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,340
How do your cells know what to do? Think
of the pacemaker cells in your heart.

64
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,200
Billions of them need to send out an
impulse just at the right moment to

65
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,230
collectively create a heartbeat ourselves,

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,830
exchange chemical information with their
neighbors house to see what they're up

67
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,780
to and then decide what to do.

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,320
If it's among a lot of cells that
are working on the same task,

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,830
it will start working on that task
as well and sync up with them.

70
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,160
There is no master minds giving commands,

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,510
just single units communicating with their
neighbors and acting according to the

72
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:02,650
feedback they gas.
What about our most important part?

73
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,950
What is the thing that asks
these kinds of questions?

74
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Is our consciousness then an immersion
property of the cells in our brain,

75
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,310
and this question is
too big and important.

76
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,350
It deserves a video of its own.

77
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,020
Some things that emerge are hard to
define. You can't touch an ant colony,

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,430
only its parts. It has
neither brain or face, nobody,

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
and yet the colony interacts with the
world just like colonies emerge from ans

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,180
things emerge from humans like nations.

81
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,510
What actually is the nation? Is it it's
population? Is it its institutions,

82
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,170
its symbols like it's
flag colors or anthems,

83
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,240
the physical things that makes links,
cities the territory it occupies.

84
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,740
All of these things are fluid.
Populations change and replaced.

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,090
Institutions come and go.
Cities can be constructed and abandoned.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Borders have changed all the time for
most of history and symbols get replaced

87
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:12,680
by new symbols. A nation
has no face, no brain,

88
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,250
no body on nations,
not real.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,670
Then of course they are
just like ant colonies.

90
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,830
Nations interact with the world. They
can change landscapes, wage wars,

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,920
grow or decline,
and they can stop existing,

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,330
but they only exist because of a lot
of humans interacting with each other,

93
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,090
but not just nations. All
the complex structures that
surround us emerge from us,

94
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,580
even if we don't intend to.
We are constantly creating communities,

95
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,620
companies, cities, societies.

96
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,160
All of these things are entities that
have fundamentally different qualities and

97
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,800
abilities than the pretty
stupid apes they emerge. Trump,

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,250
we don't know why any of this happens.

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,660
We just observe it and it seems to be
a fundamental property of our universe.

100
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,640
It may be the most beautiful and
wondrous property of our universe.
