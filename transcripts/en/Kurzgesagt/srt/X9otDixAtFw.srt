1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,350
This simple questions are the hardest
ones to answer. What is a thing?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,730
Why do things happen and why
do they happen the way they do?

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,170
Let's try to approach this step by step.
What are you made of?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,480
You matter which is made of molecules
which are made of atoms and those are made

5
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,920
of elementary particles,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,390
but if elementary particles are
the smallest things that exist,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,250
what are they made of?

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,540
To answer a simple question,

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,690
let's start simply lets the
universe clean away with matter,

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,940
anti matter,
radiation particles and anything thing.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,660
Now let's take a closer
look at absolutely nothing.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,210
Most his empty space is, it will be
called a vacuum. There are no atoms,

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,900
no matter nothing. Is it
ready? All that empty.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,760
Nothing gives us the building
blocks for everything. In a sense,

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,970
empty space is a lot
like a vast car motion.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,060
While the water is very still,
when nothing is happening,

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,030
a stiff breeze can create
some serious waves.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,590
Allie universe works a lot like this.
There are these oceans everywhere.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,750
Physicists call them fields.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,950
This might be strange in you
think about radiation for example,

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,110
by exciting what's known as
the electromagnetic field.
A little kink is created,

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,070
which is the particle we called the
Photon a particle that carries radiation.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,940
We perceive it as light.
This isn't unique to light.

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,490
Every particle in the
universe is made this way.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,900
There are fields for every particle
of matter, all with their own rules.

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,960
For example,
along with the electromagnetic fields,

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,890
there is an electron field everywhere
in the universe and little kinks in that

28
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,470
field are electrons altogether.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,710
The fields of our universe
can produce 17 particles,

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,930
which can be divided
into three categories.

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,440
The leptons and the
quarks and the bow songs.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,340
Leptons consist of the electron
as well as its cousins,

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,330
mew on and tell particles.
Each has an associated neutrino.

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,490
Then there are quarks. The quarks
are the nuclear family of particles.

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,540
They're always found bound together in
groups and pairs and make up protons and

36
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,840
neutrons which make up the
nuclei of atoms together.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,770
The leptons and quarks are the matter
particles. They make up all the things.

38
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,860
You see the air you breathe,
the sun that warms you,

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,130
the computer you're using right now to
distract yourself from the stuff you

40
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,130
should be doing.
But things don't just exist.

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,700
They also do stuff in some philosophical
sense, the properties of a thing. Oh,

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,390
just as much a part of
it as existence itself.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,110
This is where the boats ons and the
fields that make them come into play.

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,590
While the quarks and leptons
are made by massive fields,

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,300
the [inaudible] are made by force
fields we call a rule of the universe,

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,380
a force. And so far, four fundamental
forces have been discovered,

47
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,160
electromagnetism, gravity, and the
strong and weak nuclear forces.

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,750
These forces are the rule book of a game
where the pieces are particles and the

49
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,190
game is the universe.

50
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,700
They tell particles what they
can do and how they can do it.

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,650
Bishop's move diagonally.

52
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,490
Massless particles move at the
speed of light nights can jump.

53
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,530
Gravity attracts the forces are the
rules for how particles interact,

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,740
which ultimately make
them the rules for help.

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,080
Articles assemble into all the
big things we see in the universe.

56
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,990
Gravity isn't just the rule.

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,110
Four orbits around the sun or apples
falling from trees. As a rule,

58
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,710
it says matter attracts,
which builds planets and stars.

59
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,750
Electromagnetism isn't just a rule
for magnets attracting or repelling or

60
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,460
electric currents in light bulbs,

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,530
it's governs all atomic bonds
building every molecule together.

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,490
Forces and particles are sort of
like the tinker toys of existence.

63
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,670
The both hands are like
messengers passed between,

64
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,070
you could say connecting
the matter particles,

65
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,170
which they use to tell
each other how to move.

66
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,150
Each particle uses a certain set of the
forces to interact with other particles.

67
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,710
[inaudible],
for example,

68
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,430
can interact with each other
with electromagnetism and
the strong nuclear force,

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,090
but electrons don't use the strong force,
just electromagnetism.

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
The quarks exchange
strong force boasts ons,

71
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,780
communicating the strong
nuclear attraction to each
other while the proton that

72
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:27,130
they build, exchange
particles of electromagnetism,
photons with the electrons,

73
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,020
thus the quarks and up locked up in nuclei
while the electronics remain attached

74
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,510
by their electric
attraction building atoms.

75
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,890
Even though the universe has lots of big,
messy phenomena like life,

76
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,430
Supernova and computers that
seemed complex on the surface,

77
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,560
if you zoom in far enough on anything,

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,060
you just get 17 particles emerging from
underlying fields playing a game with

79
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,320
four rules. To summarize in the
most basic form, we know right now,

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,150
this is what things are.

81
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,470
This theory is what physicists call
the standard model of particle physics.

82
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,150
You are basically nothing more than
disturbances on an ocean that's excited by

83
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,020
energy and guided by forces that
make up the rules of the universe,

84
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,530
but why and what is a force?

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,430
We'll have to explore a few more simple
questions to get to the bottom of this.

86
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,030
We made some wallpapers from some
of the graphics in this video.

87
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,410
