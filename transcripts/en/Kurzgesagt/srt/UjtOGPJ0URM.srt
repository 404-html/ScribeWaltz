1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Imagine NASA announced today that
they found a bacteria on Mars,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,270
weird avian fish in the oceans of Europa
and also ancient alien ruins on title.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,740
Wouldn't that be great? Well,
no, it will be horrible news.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,130
Devastating even it could mean that the
end of humanity is almost certain and

5
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,300
that it might be coming soon.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,120
Why white would the most exciting
discovery of our lifetime be bad?

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Let us imagine the development of life
from its inception to us today as a

8
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,900
flight of stairs,

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,520
the first day of his dad chemistry
that needs to assemble itself into self

10
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:55,500
replicating patterns, stable
and resilient, but also
able to change and evolve.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,700
The second step is for our early
life to become more complex,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,560
able to build more complicated structures
and use the available energy much more

13
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,670
efficiently.
On the next step,

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,020
the cells combined to
become multicellular beings,

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,560
enabling unbelievable variety
and further complexity.

16
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,320
The step above sees a species evolve.
Big brains enabling the use of tools,

17
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,220
culture, and shad knowledge, which
creates even higher complexity.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,410
The species can now become the dominant
life form on its Panisse and change it

19
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:33,000
according to its needs. First shy attempts
to leave its planets are happening.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,010
This is where we are now.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,520
It's in the nature of life as we know is
to reach out to cover every new HSA cap

22
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,700
and since planets have a limited
carrying capacity and lifespan,

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,140
if a species wants to survive,
it will look for more places to spread to.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,620
So the steps above the
current ones seemed logical,

25
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,010
colonize Europe so the system then spread
further to reach other stars to the

26
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:02,280
possible final step.
Becoming a galaxy wide civilization,

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,170
it's very likely that this is a
universal principle for civilizations,

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,460
no matter where they're from.

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,170
If a species is competitive and driven
enough to take control over its planet,

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,880
they'll probably not stop there.

31
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,950
We know that there are up to 500
billion planets in the Milky Way,

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,680
at least 10 billion earthlike planets.

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,010
Many have been around billions
of years longer than earth,

34
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,060
but we're observing zero
galactic civilizations.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,930
We should be able to see something,
but there's nothing.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,870
Space seems to be empty and dad,

37
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,150
this means something is preventing
living things from climbing the staircase

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,520
beyond the step we're on right now.

39
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,160
Something that makes becoming a
galactic civilization extremely hard,

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,930
maybe impossible.
This is the great filter,

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,730
a challenge or danger,

42
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:01,510
so hard to overcome that it eliminates
every species that encounters it.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,390
There are two scenarios. One means
we are incredibly special and lucky.

44
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,770
The other one means we are doomed
and practically already dead.

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,300
It depends on where the
filter is on our staircase,

46
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,950
behind or ahead of us.
The scenario one,

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,280
the filter is behind us.
We are the first.

48
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,920
If the filter is behind us,

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,850
that means that one of the steps we
passed is almost impossible to take.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,410
Which step could it be?
Is Life itself extremely rare?

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,720
It's very hard to make predictions about
how likely it is for life to emerge

52
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,180
from death things there is low consensus.

53
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,170
Some scientists think it develops
everywhere where the conditions are right.

54
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,790
Others think that earth might be the
only living place in the universe.

55
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,720
Another kind of data is the
step of complex animal cells.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,340
A very specific thing happened on
their step and as far as we know,

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,640
it happened exactly once a primitive
hunter hill swallowed another salad,

58
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,250
but instead of devouring it,
the two cells formed a union.

59
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,200
The bigger sell provided shelter took
care of interacting with the environment

60
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,550
and providing resources.

61
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,990
While this water one used its new home
and free stuff to focus on providing a

62
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,980
lot of extra energy for its host.
With the abundant energy,

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,020
the host cell could grow more than before
and build new and expensive things to

64
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,680
improve itself. While the guest
became the powerhouse of the cell,

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,310
the cells make up every
animal on the planet.

66
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,720
Maybe there are billions of bacteria
covered planets in the Milky Way,

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,220
but not a single one.

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Apart from us has achieved our
level of complexity or intelligence.

69
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,340
We humans feel very smart
and sophisticated with
our crossword puzzles and

70
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,280
romantic novels,
but a big brain is at first and foremost,

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,600
a very expensive evolutionary investment.
They are fragile.

72
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,090
They don't help in a
fistfight with a bath.

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,570
They cost enormous amounts
of energy and despite them,

74
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,670
it took modern humans 200,000 years to
get from sharp sticks to civilization.

75
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,180
Being smart does not mean
you get to win automatically.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,130
Maybe intelligence is just not so great
and we're lucky that it worked out for

77
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,090
us.
Scenario to the filter is ahead of us.

78
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,700
Plenty of others died already.

79
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,220
A great filter before us is orders of
magnitude more dangerous than anything we

80
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,330
encountered so far.

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,460
Even if a major disaster killed most of
us or through us back thousands of years,

82
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,850
we would survive and recover
and if we can recover,

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,300
even if it takes a million years,
then it's not a great filter,

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,220
but just a roadblock to an eventual
galactic civilization on universal

85
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,790
timescales. Even millions of
years adjust the blink of an eye.

86
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,500
If a great filter really lies before us,
it has to be so dangerous,

87
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,740
so purely devastating and powerful
that it has destroyed most,

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,570
if not a full advanced civilizations
in our galaxy over billions of years.

89
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,450
A really daunting and
depressing hypothesis is that
once a species takes control

90
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:15,620
over its [inaudible], it's already
on the path to self destruction.

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,010
Technology is a good way to achieve that.

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,990
It needs to be something that's so obvious
that virtually everybody discovers it

93
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,290
and so dangerous that it's discovery
leads almost universally to an existential

94
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,600
disaster,
a large scale,

95
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:35,330
and you clear wall nanotechnology
that gets out of control.

96
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,280
Genetic engineering of the perfect
Silverberg, an experiment that nights,

97
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,720
the whole atmosphere on fire.

98
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,350
It might be a super intelligent AI that
accidentally or purposely destroys its

99
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:52,901
creators or things that we can't even
see coming right now or it's way simpler

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,380
species competitive enough
to take over that planet,

101
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,120
necessarily destroy it well competing
with each other for resources,

102
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,530
maybe there are runaway chain.

103
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:08,531
We actions in every ecosystem that once
set in motion are not fixable and so

104
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,800
once the civilization is powerful
enough to change the composition of its

105
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:17,240
atmosphere, they make that planet
uninhabitable 100% of the time.

106
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,950
Let's hope that that's not the case.
If the filter is ahead of us,

107
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,910
our odds are really bad.
What we can hope for.

108
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,440
This is why finding life
beyond earth would be horrible.

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,540
The more common life is in the universe
and the more advanced and complex it is,

110
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,570
the more likely it becomes that
a filter is in front of us.

111
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,280
Bacteria would be bad. Small animals
would be worse and intelligent.

112
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,450
Life would be alarming.

113
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,190
Ruins of ancient alien
civilizations would be horrible.

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,680
The best case scenario for us
right now is that laws is sterile,

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,040
that Europa's oceans are devoid of
life and the vast arms of the Milky Way

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,530
harbor only empty oceans
hugging dead continents,

117
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,600
that there are billions of empty planets
waiting to be discovered and to be

118
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,830
filled up with life.

119
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,620
Billions of new homes waiting
for us to finally arrive.

120
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,820
How likely is it that we'll find life
outside of earth that is similar to us?

121
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,800
Well, that depends on how many planets
there are out there and they're stars.

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,820
Goldilocks zone,

123
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,830
the area around the star where water
can be liquid because stars come in all

124
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,270
sizes and configurations.

125
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,740
This zone is different for every star
system and requires a little bit of

126
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:43,250
physics to figure out if
that sounds like fun to you.

127
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,720
This quiz from brilliant helps to break
down the maths for exactly how this is

128
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,970
calculated.

then build back up to an interesting

133
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,124
conclusion.

the first 688 people will also get
20% of that and your membership.

138
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,050
And if you do find life on other planets,

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,380
it made the wise to leave
them alone for a while.
