1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
Life is fundamentally different from
dead stuff or is it physicist having

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,620
shredding a defined life this way,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,210
living things avoid decay
into disorder and equilibrium.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,400
What does this mean? Let's pretend the
chore download folder is the Universe.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,120
It started orderly and got more
and more chaotic over time.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,470
By investing energy,
you can create order and clean it up.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,730
This is what living things do,
but what is life?

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,460
Every living thing on this
planet is made of cells.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,430
Basically a cell is a protein based robot.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,160
Too small to feel or experience anything.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,040
It has the properties we
just assigned to life.

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,670
It has a wall that separates it from
the surroundings creating order.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,240
It regulates itself and maintains a
constant state is eat stuff to stay alive.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,070
A grows and develops.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,280
It reacts to the environment and it's
subject to evolution and it makes more of

16
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:10,540
itself, but of all the stuff that
makes up a cell, no part is alive.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,780
Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff.

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,850
Forming reactions that start to other
reactions which start other reactions in a

19
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:23,320
single cell. Every second, several
million chemical reactions take place.

20
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,150
Forming eight complex orchestra.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,770
A cell can build several thousand
types of protein, some very simple,

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,900
some complex micro machines.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,120
Imagine driving a car at 100 kilometers
an hour while constantly rebuilding

24
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,210
every single part of it with
stuff you collect from the street.

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,130
That is what cells do,
but no part of the cell is alive.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Everything is dead matter moved by
the laws of the universe is life.

27
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,400
The aggregate of all these reaction
processes that are taking place.

28
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,520
Eventually every living thing will die.

29
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,830
The goal of the whole process is to
prevent this by producing new entities,

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,470
and by this we mean DNA.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,180
Life is in a way just a lot of stuff
that carries genetic information around.

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,860
Every living thing is subject to evolution
and the DNA that develops the best

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,410
living thing around it
will stay in the game,

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,840
so his DNA life.
Then if you take DNA out of its hole,

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,700
it certainly is a very complex molecule,
but it can't do anything by itself.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,660
This is where viruses make
everything more complicated.

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
They are basically strings of RNA or
DNA in a small hall and need cells to do

38
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,614
something.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,740
We're not sure if they count as living
or dead and still there are 225 million

40
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:49,180
cubic meters of viruses on earth. They
don't seem to care what we think of them.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,640
There are even viruses that invade dead
cells and reanimate them so they can be

42
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,370
a host for them,
which blurs the line even more.

43
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,270
Or they are the power plants of most
complex cells and were previously free

44
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,140
living bacteria that entered a
partnership with a bigger cells.

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,190
They still have their own DNA
and can multiply on their own,

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,390
but they are not alive anymore.
They are dead.

47
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,470
So they traded their own life
for the survival of their DNA,

48
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,720
which means living things can evolve into
dead things as long as it's beneficial

49
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,920
to their genetic code.

50
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
So maybe knife is information that
manages to ensure its continued existence.

51
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,530
But what about AI?

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,370
Artificial intelligence by
almost common definitions,

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,210
we are very close to creating
artificial life in computers.

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,260
It's just a question of time before
the technology we built gets that.

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,720
And this is not science fiction either.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,020
There are a lot of smart people
actively working on this.

57
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,790
You could already argue the computer
viruses are alive. Hmm. Okay,

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,170
so what is life then? Things, processes,

59
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,450
DNA information.

60
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,540
This got confusing very fast.

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,430
One thing is for sure the idea that
knife is fundamentally different from

62
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:17,080
nonliving things because they contain
some nonphysical animate or are governed

63
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,040
by different principles than inanimate
objects. Turns out to be wrong.

64
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,380
Before Charles Darwin humans draw a
line between themselves and the rest of

65
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:30,790
living things. There was something
magical about us that made us special.

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,130
Once we had to accept, we are like every
living being a product of evolution.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
We drew a different vibe,

68
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,680
but the more we learn about what
computers can do and how life works,

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,520
the closer we get to creating the first
machine that fits our description of

70
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:49,420
life, the more our image of
ourselves is in danger again,

71
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,370
and this will happen sooner or later.
And here's another question for you.

72
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,670
If everything in the universe
is made of the same staff,

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,840
does this mean everything in the universe
is dead or that everything in the

74
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:06,010
universe is alive?
That it's just a question of complexity.

75
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,410
Does this mean we can never die?

76
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,730
Because we were never alive in the first
place is life and death and a relevant

77
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,830
question and we haven't noticed it yet.

78
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,660
Is it possible we are much more part of
the universe around us than we thought?

79
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,840
Don't look at us.
We don't have any answers for you.

80
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,200
Just questions for you to think about.
After all,

81
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,970
it's thinking about questions like this
that makes us feel alive and gives us

82
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,750
some comfort.
