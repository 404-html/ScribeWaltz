Hey Youtube. Have you ever wondered why
we only upload one video each month? Well,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,980
the answer's really easy. Time
and money. It's fun of course,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,640
but to make animation videos like this,
a ridiculous amount of time is necessary.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,280
Writing the script, storyboard,
designing all the stuff,

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,780
recording that aeration animation, sound
design, and composing original music.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,850
We would love to make more videos,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,610
but it's just impossible right
now without a time machine.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,270
We all have real jobs and do quotes
cause our late nights and on the weekends

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,680
because it's our passion,

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,160
but we prefer doing it while the sun
is shining and make more videos for you

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,780
guys, but now you can help us make
more science and educational content.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,240
There's this great new
thing called Patrion.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,910
Patrion is a crowdfunding
platform like Kickstarter,

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,120
but it works on a monthly basis
with smaller amounts. If you want,

15
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,850
you can support us with a small sum
each month and we will spend this time

16
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,450
working elsewhere and make more videos.
Depending on the amount you'll get.

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,970
Core reward like graphics for
your smartphone or computer.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,030
Our music links in the video
description or our record,

19
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:01,080
your voicemail message that says
the mailbox of a man called Jimmy,

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,430
something like that. Even the smallest
amounts. Helpful. We really appreciate it.

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,180
Oh, videos will stay free on youtube
forever, so if you don't want to fund us,

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,270
nothing will change for you.
If we get enough money through Patrion,

23
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:15,630
we can invest more time in cuts because
I make more than one video every four

24
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,630
weeks in the future. Thank you all
for your attention. Lots of love.

25
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,100
All the fields.
Coats cause out.
