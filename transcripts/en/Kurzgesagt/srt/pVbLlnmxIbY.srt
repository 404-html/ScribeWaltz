1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,810
Three reasons why we should
continue using nuclear energy.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,410
One Nuclear Energy Saves lives in 2013
a study conducted by NASA found that

3
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:15,360
nuclear energy has prevented
around 1.8 million deaths,

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,720
even if you include the death
tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,610
Nuclear energy ranks last in
death per energy units produced.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,400
While nuclear waste is really toxic,

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,380
it's usually stored somewhere while the
toxic byproducts of fossil fuels are

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,510
pumped into the air.
We breathe every day.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,170
So just by reducing the
amount of fossil fuels burned.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,820
Countless cases of cancer or lung disease
and accidents in coal mines have been

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
avoided.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,860
If we can choose between lots of dangerous
stuff being put into a deep hole and

13
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:50,880
lots and lots and lots of dangerous
stuff being pumped into the atmosphere.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,890
The former seems more logical.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,050
Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous
though single catastrophic events burned

16
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,440
into our memory while coal
and oil kills sign and date,

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,800
it's like the death rate
of flying versus driving.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Even in the best case scenario,

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,160
it would take at least 40 years to
switch to 100% renewable energy.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,550
So for as long as we
continue using fossil fuels,

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,730
nuclear energy will save way more lives
than it destroys to nuclear energy

22
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,740
reduces co two emissions.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,750
Nuclear energy is arguably way less
harmful to the environment in terms of

24
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:29,730
climate change than fossil fuels.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Our main source of energy since 1976
about 64 gigatons of greenhouse gas

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:40,971
emissions have not been pumped out thanks
to nuclear energy and by the mid 21st

27
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:46,470
century that could amount to an
additional 80 to 240 gigatons.

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,690
Humanity's energy consumption is raising
steadily according to u s government

29
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:52,440
projections,

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,910
China alone will add the equivalent of
a new 600 megawatt coal plant every 10

31
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,710
days for the next 10 years. China
already burns 4 billion tons of coal.

32
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,910
The chair coal is cheap,
relatively abundant and easy to get to.

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,890
So it's not likely that humanity will
stop using it soon when nuclear energy

34
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:14,910
might be the only way of dampening the
effects of climate change and preventing

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,590
a catastrophic manmade global warming
compared to the other things we do.

36
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,080
Nuclear energy is relatively clean,

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,980
so even if it is a good idea to
quit nuclear energy longterm,

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,880
it might be a good solution for the
next hundred years or so compared to the

39
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,060
alternatives.
Three new technologies,

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,190
maybe technology will solve the problem
of nuclear waste and dangerous power

41
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,024
plants.

42
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,090
The nuclear reactors we've used so far
are mostly outdated technology because

43
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,770
nuclear innovation stopped in the 1970s
there are models like the ethereum

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,520
reactor that could solve the problem
altogether. Thorim as abundant, ready,

45
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:57,570
hard to turn into nuclear weapons and
up to two orders of magnitude less

46
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,590
wasteful than current nuclear reactors.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,850
The waste material might also be only
dangerous for a few hundred years.

48
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,220
In contrast to a couple of thousand years,

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,110
one ton of Thor IOM is estimated to
provide the same amount of energy as 200

50
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,560
tons of uranium,
all 3.5 million tons of coal.

51
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,120
So while we cannot know for
sure if alternative nuclear
technology will keep its

52
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,780
promises,

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,680
shouldn't we at least do more research
before we forego an opportunity to solve

54
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,760
lots of humanities current problems?
It might not be an easy challenge,

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,470
but that hasn't stopped us before.
So should we use nuclear energy?

56
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,820
There are risks involved in any great
human endeavor and we have to make an

57
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,370
informed decision rather
than rely on gut feeling.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,110
