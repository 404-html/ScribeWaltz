1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,340
Okay. The 14 moons of
Neptune or a strange bunch.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,680
Most of them are small potato
shaped pieces of ice and rock.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,100
Some so far away from Neptune that they
need to 29 years to circle Neptune once.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,730
Almost all of them are restaurants
trapped by Neptune's gravity.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,810
99.5% of all the mass around
Neptune is concentrated in Tryson.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,550
It's the seventh biggest moon and more
massive than all other known moons in the

7
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,550
solar system.
That house smaller than itself combined.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,600
It's surface area is about as big as
the mainland of Russia and Australia

9
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,240
together.
Also,

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,330
Triton is one of only four objects
in the solar system that we know is

11
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,650
geologically active.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,200
Tryson orbits Neptune in
the wrong direction against
the rotation of net unit,

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,040
which is unique and how so to system
for an object as big as Triton.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,420
We can conclude from this. The Triton
hasn't always been a moon of Neptune,

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,740
but probably was a dwarf planet that
was forced into submission by knap June

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,740
when the solar system was
younger and more chaotic.

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,630
The most popular theory here is the
Tryson was once part of a double system.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,110
When Neptune migrated to the
outer edges of the solar system,

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,520
it's gravity interfered with a double
system and catapulted the other objective

20
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,250
to space.
While Triton was forced into orbis,

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,690
this would have disrupted the orbits of
other net tune moons rather violently,

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,960
and would most likely have either
pushed them away from Neptune,

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,510
all let them collide
or crash into Neptune.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,400
This would explain why Neptune's
moons are so dominated by Triton,

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,400
but this will end one day.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Triton is being slowed down by Neptune
and eventually it will either crash into

27
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:50,381
it all be ground by Neptune's gravity
into a shoe during system similar to

28
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,250
assassins.
So don't buy real estate on Triton.
