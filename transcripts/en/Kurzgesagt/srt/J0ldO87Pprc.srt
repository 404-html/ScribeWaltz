1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,260
What would happen if you were to
bring a tiny pieces, the sun to Earth?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,750
Short answer, you die. Long answer.
It depends which piece of the sun.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,450
Like most of the matter in the universe,
our son is neither solid liquid or gas,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
but plasma plasma is when stuff is so
hot that the nuclei and electrons can

5
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,930
separate and flow around freely,
which creates a glue like substance.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,540
So you can imagine our son has an
extremely big spherical ocean of very hot

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,370
glue. The deeper you go the dancer
and the wetter the Goo becomes.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,350
So let's bring three samples each the
size of our house to our lab here on earth

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,550
and see what happens.

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,770
First sample the Chromos fair.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,950
The Chromos fat is the
atmosphere of the sun.

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,610
A layer of spouse gas up
to 5,000 kilometers deep.

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,870
That's covered in a forest
of plasma spikes. That can
be almost as big as earth.

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,640
It's pretty hot here between
6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius.

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,440
But if we brought a solvent vet to earth,

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,850
we're not really getting our money's worth
in the area where we take our sample.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,940
The cruise is fair, is over a
million times less dense than air,

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,220
so compared to our
atmosphere at sea level,

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,580
it's basically the same as bringing
the vacuum of space down to earth.

20
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,920
The moment our sample arrives,

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,910
it would immediately be crushed by
Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,320
Our would rush to fill the vacuum and
use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT

23
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,570
in the process.
This creates a high pressure shockwave,

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,410
which shatters glass, ruptures, air
drums, and maybe some internal organs.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,110
If you're standing too close,
it could kill you,

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,770
so you'd better keep your testers.
Let's go deeper.

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,930
The second sample,

28
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,120
the photosphere beneath the Chromos
fair is the glowing surface of the sun,

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,400
the fitters fair,
which produces the light.

30
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:06,600
We see it's covered in a grade of
a million hotspots called granules,

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,220
each of them about as big as the United
States and over 5,000 degrees Celsius.

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,810
These granules, other tops of
convective columns, churning gas,

33
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:18,660
that brings the heat up from the
center of the sun to its surface.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,580
In these columns, a few hundred kilometers
down, we take our second plasma sample.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,820
It has about the same pressure
as our atmosphere on earth,

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
though still much less dense than air.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
It's heat support says
so it won't implode.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,160
Our sphere now carries
twice as much energy,

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,430
as much as 25 kilograms of TNT that this
time has heat for a dazzling instant.

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,860
This plasma would glow
with a million times.

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,820
The brightness of the sun seemed from
earth instantly lighting fires throughout

42
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,760
our lab, but a few milliseconds later,
those fires are all that's left.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,400
The plasma has cooled to harness gas
floating up from the flaming Roy's.

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,790
What if we go deeper?
Third sample,

45
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,840
the radius of zone here,

46
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:08,350
the plasma is about 2 million degrees
Celsius and so dense and tightly packed.

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,540
The creates a sort of maze for itself.

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,510
Energy in the form of
photons tries to escape,

49
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,440
but it has to wonder for hundreds of
thousands of years bouncing endlessly from

50
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,230
particle to particle until it
eventually finds an access.

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Bringing matter from here to our lab
is what experts call a very bad idea.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,900
As soon as it arrives in our lab,

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,010
the extreme pressure that holds the
plasma tightly together is gone and the

54
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,920
material explodes with the
power of a thermonuclear weapon.

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,730
Our lab was what does the city around
it will be destroyed in an instant.

56
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,163
On the bright side,

57
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,100
there won't be any radioactive
fallout with our lamp destroyed.

58
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,160
We can abandon the illusion that
we're trying to do any science today.

59
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,170
What if we go much, much
deeper? Last sample,

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,070
the core hair in the
central 1% of the staff,

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,500
we find a third of the sun's mass.

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,730
The matter here is compressed by the
weight of the entire star above it.

63
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,290
In the center of the core,
the temperature is 15 million degrees,

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,790
has enough to make helium by smashing
together hydrogen powering the sun by

65
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:17,650
nuclear fusion in billions of
years after the death of the son.

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,750
This call will remain as a wide off.
If we brought a sample of it to earth,

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,700
it would cause a lot of inconvenience.

68
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,460
The biggest nuclear weapon ever designated
had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,950
or acute the size of the
empire state building.

70
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,760
Our sample has the equivalent
of 4,000 Vaca towns.

71
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,230
This is 4 billion tons of TNT or a cube,

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,920
1.3 kilometers high.
To give you a sense of scale,

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,930
this is the cube inside Manhattan.
Once the sphere arrives on earth,

74
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,580
this super dense matter expands instantly
and creates an explosion with the

75
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,800
force of,
well the sun.

76
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,280
If we get the sample in
Paris in the morning,

77
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,730
the citizens of London would see
what looks like a second sunrise,

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,680
but one that gets brighter and brighter
and hotter and hotter until London burns

79
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:13,240
to ashes in a radius of about
300 kilometers around the blast,

80
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,610
everything would be birthed.

81
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,910
The shock wave would travel
around the earth multiple times.

82
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,450
Most buildings in central
Europe would be flattened.

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,200
Eardrums would rupture and windows
break across the continent.

84
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,450
The explosion would be apocalyptic,
possibly human civilization ending.

85
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,700
If humans did survive,

86
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,660
we could count on the dust blown into
the atmosphere to create a small ice age.

87
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,630
So if there is one tiny bright side,

88
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,350
it would be that the explosion might be
an effective way to control human caused

89
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,340
climate change for a few decades.
While this is definitely a good thing.

90
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,210
All in all we conclude that we should
not try to bring the sun to Earth.

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,210
We've made a lot of questionable
assumptions, this video,
but our maths is real.

92
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,290
If you're like us and you enjoy using the
power of math to calculate absurd ways

93
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,124
to destroy stuff,

94
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,700
he may be interested in all the other
things you can do with maths. For example,

95
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,180
you could calculate how to mind mercury
for silicon to build a Dyson sphere.

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,140
Determine how long it will take the
sun to burnout or simply do your taxes.

97
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,870
But as much as we love
explaining these things,

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,840
the best way to learn anything
is by doing it yourself.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,980
Brilliant is a problem solving website
that teaches you to think like a

100
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,020
scientist by guiding you through problems.

101
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,860
They take concepts like these and
break them up into bite sized nuggets,

102
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,580
present clear thinking in each part and
then build back up to an interesting

103
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:38,540
conclusion.
