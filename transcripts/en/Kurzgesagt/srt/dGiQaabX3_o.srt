1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,780
The world we live in Phil's normal,
ordinary.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,820
It feels like this is just how
humans exist and always existed,

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,890
but it's not.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,730
Never before have we humans lived in a
world as sophisticated and engineered to

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,210
our needs as today,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,590
giving us the luxury to forget about
ourselves and not worry about survival,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,190
food, shelter, security. All of this
is more or less taken for granted,

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,320
but we're a special few.
For more than 99.99% of human history,

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,880
life was completely different and
there's no such thing as just one human

10
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
history.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,160
Our story begins the 6 million years
ago when the tribe of Khomeini split and

12
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:58,150
our relationship with the apes
and lit 2.8 billion years ago,

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,240
the genus of homer,
the first humans emerged.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,580
We like to think of ourselves as the only
humans, but this is far from the truth.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,100
When we homo Sapien sapiens came
into existence 200,000 years ago,

16
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,310
there were at least six other human
species around cousins of comparable

17
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:21,100
intelligence and ability,
which must have been incredibly scary,

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,110
kind of like living with aliens.
Some of them were very successful.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,770
Homo Erectus, for example,
survived for 2 million years,

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,070
10 times longer than
modern humans have existed.

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,420
The last of the other humans
disappeared around 10,000 years ago.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,450
We don't know what caused them to die out.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,370
Modern humans have at least a few percent
of neanderthal and other human DNA,

24
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,990
so there was some mixing,

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,780
but certainly not enough to
be a merger between species.

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,530
So we don't know if our cousins went
away because they lost the battle over

27
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,590
resources or because of a
series of minor genocides.

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Either way only we remain back to the
beginnings of humanity 2.8 million years

29
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,300
ago.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,380
Early humans use tools but did not make
a lot of progress for nearly 2 million

31
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,680
years until they learned to control fire.

32
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,180
Fire meant cooking,
which made food more nutritious,

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,610
which contributed to the
development of our brain.

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,380
It also produced light and warmth
who'd made days longer and winters less

35
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:27,400
gruesome. On top of that, it
not only scared predators away,

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,020
it could also be used for hunting a
torched word or grassland provided small

37
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:32,480
animals,

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,390
nuts and tubers that were pre
roasted from 300,000 years ago.

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,650
Most of the different human species
lived in small hunter gatherer societies.

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,880
They had fire, wood and stone
tools planned for the future,

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,790
buried their dad and had
cultures have their own,

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,070
but most importantly they spoke to
each other probably in a kind of proto

43
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:58,450
language, less complex and
ours. If we had a time machine,

44
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,910
how would we be able to go back,

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,950
steal a few babies and raise them today
without anyone noticing that they're a

46
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,784
bit different?

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,300
There is much debate anatomically
modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago,

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
but probably 70,000 years as far as we
could travel back and still snatch a

49
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,950
behaviorally modern human.
Before that,

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,480
the babies would probably
lack a few crucial gene
mutations necessary to build a

51
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,640
brain with modern language and abstract.

52
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,750
Thinking about it is at some
point around 50,000 years ago,

53
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,850
there was an explosion in innovation tools
and weapons became more sophisticated

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,110
and culture quickpay more complex
because at this point humans had a

55
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:45,490
multipurpose brain and a more advanced
language to communicate information with

56
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,190
each other effectively and
down to the last detail.

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,350
This allowed much closer corporation and
is what really makes us different from

58
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,580
any other creature on earth,

59
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,010
not our comparatively weak
bodies and inferior senses,

60
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,000
but the ability to cooperate flexibly
in large groups, unlike for example,

61
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,600
Richard beehives or intimate
but tiny wolf packs.

62
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,000
As our brain evolves,

63
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,200
we became able to do something life
had been unable to do up to this point.

64
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,730
One,

65
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,730
expand knowledge quickly to preserve
the knowledge gained over generations.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,900
Three, build on past knowledge
to gain even deeper insights.

67
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,110
This seems daft,
but until then,

68
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,350
information had to be passed on
from generation to generation,

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,090
mostly through genetics,

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,560
which is not efficient still
for the next 40,000 years,

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
human life remained more or less the same.
There was little to build upon.

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
Our ancestors were only one animal
among many building a skyscraper.

73
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,330
Without knowing what a house is is hard,
but one,

74
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:56,650
it's easy to be arrogant in our attitude
to our ancestors. This will be ignorant.

75
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,340
Humans 50,000 years ago
were survival specialists.

76
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,070
They had a detailed mental
map of their territory.

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,650
Their senses were fine
tuned to the environment.

78
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,030
They knew and memorized a great amount
of information about plants and animals.

79
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,800
They could make complicated tools that
required years of careful training and

80
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:19,240
very fine motor skills. Their bodies
compared to our athletes today,

81
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,410
just because of their daily routines
and they lived a rich social life within

82
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,244
their tribe.

83
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,290
Survival required so many skills that
the average brain volume of early modern

84
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,580
humans might even have been bigger
than it is today. As a group,

85
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,260
we know more today, but as individuals,
our ancestors were superior to us,

86
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,550
but then around 12,000 years
ago in multiple locations,

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,590
humans developed agriculture.

88
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,840
Everything changed very quickly before
survival as a hunter and foraging

89
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:54,220
required superb physical and mental,
but it is in all fields from everybody.

90
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,800
With the rise of the agricultural age,

91
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,220
individuals could increasingly rely
on the skills of others for survival.

92
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,020
This meant that some of
them could specialize. Maybe
they worked on better tools,

93
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,890
maybe they took time to breed more
resistant crops or better livestock.

94
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,960
Maybe they started inventing things as
farming got more and more efficient.

95
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,230
What we call civilization
began agriculture gave us
a reliable and predictable

96
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,254
food source,

97
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,500
which allowed humans to hoard food
on a large scale for the first time,

98
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,050
which is much easier to do with grains.
The meat,

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,540
the food stock required protection,

100
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,410
which led to communities living
together in tighter spaces. First,

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,100
early defense structures were built.
The need for organization grew.

102
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,880
The more organized we got,
the faster things became efficient.

103
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,690
Villages became cities.
Cities became kingdoms.

104
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,940
Kingdoms became empires.

105
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,900
Connections between humans exploded,

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,030
which led to opportunities to exchange
knowledge. Progress became exponential.

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,850
About 500 years ago, the scientific
revolution began. Mathematics, physics,

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,770
astronomy, biology, and
chemistry transformed
everything we thought. We knew.

109
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,450
The industrial revolution followed soon
after laying the foundation for the

110
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:12,284
modern world.

111
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,210
As our overall efficiency
grew exponentially more
people could spend their

112
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:21,950
lifetime contributing to the progress
of humanity. Revolutions kept happening.

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
The invention of the computer,
its evolution into a medium.

114
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,420
We all use on a daily basis and the
rise of the Internet shaped how wild.

115
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,840
It's hard to grasp how
fast all of a habit.

116
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,090
It's been about 125,000 generations
since the emergence of the first human

117
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,924
species,

118
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,150
about 7,500 generations
since the physiologically
modern human saw the light of

119
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:47,060
day 500 generations ago.

120
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,870
What we call civilization
began 20 generations go.

121
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,730
We learned how to do science and the
Internet became available to most people

122
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,170
only one generation ago.

123
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,570
Today we live in the most prosperous
age humanity has ever experienced.

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
We have transformed.

125
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:08,300
There's planets from the composition of
its atmosphere to large scale changes in

126
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:12,050
its landscape and also in terms
of the other animals in existence.

127
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,940
We light up the night with artificial
stars and put people in a metal box in the

128
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:21,140
sky. Some have even walked on our moon.
We've got robots and other planets.

129
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,220
We've looked deep into the past of
the universe with mechanical eyes.

130
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,140
Our knowledge and our way of acquiring
and storing more of it has exploded.

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,860
The average high school student today
knows more about the universe than a

132
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:37,490
scholar a few centuries ago.
Humans dominate this panic.

133
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,920
Even if our rule is very fragile,

134
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,500
we are still not that different from
our ancestors at 70,000 years ago,

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
but your lifestyle has existed for less
than 0.001% of human history from here

136
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:57,540
on. There's no saying what the future
holds for. We're building a skyscraper,

137
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,410
but we're not sure if it's standing on
a solid foundation or if we're building

138
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,560
it on quicksand.
Let's leave it with that for now.

139
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,300
The next time you miss your train,

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,240
your burger is not hot enough
or someone cuts in line.

141
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,090
Remember how special
there's up human world is?

142
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,750
Maybe it's not worth being upset
about all those little things.

149
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,220
so we can at least listen to them.
In general.

150
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,680
We listened to a lot of audio
books while designing our videos,

151
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,830
so we can highly recommend audible.
Okay.

152
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,500
This was our first take on
making a history related video.

153
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,030
We'd love to make much more of them,

154
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,460
but they take even more
time than our average video,

155
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,270
so we might do three or four a year.
Your feedback's very welcome here.

156
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,840
Thank you so much for watching and
if you want to support us directly,

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,260
you can do so on Patriot. It really
helps us out. You think about it here,

158
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,210
or more videos if you
need more distraction.
