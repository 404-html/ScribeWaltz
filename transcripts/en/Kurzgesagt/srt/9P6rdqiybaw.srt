1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,850
If you saw a worm hole in reality
it would appear round spherical,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,120
a bit like a black hole light from the
other side passes through and gives you a

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,490
window to a far away place once crossed,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,610
the other side comes for the
interview with your old home.

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,220
Now receding into that
shimmering spherical window,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,270
but our wormholes real or are they just
magic disguised as physics and maths?

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,870
If they are real, how do they
work and where can we find them?

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,700
For most of human history,
we thought space was pretty simple.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,470
A big flat stage where the
events are the universe unfold.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,780
Even if you take down the
set of planets and stars,

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,960
there's still something left that's empty.

12
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:59,280
Stage is space and it exists
unchanging and eternal.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,940
Einstein's theory of
relativity change that.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,780
It says that space and time makeup that
stage together and they aren't the same

15
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:13,470
everywhere. The things on the
stage can affect the stage itself.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,090
Stretching and warping it.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,140
If the old stage was like
unmoving hardwood Einstein
stage is more like a water

18
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:22,324
bed.

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,570
This kind of elastic space can be bent
and maybe even torn and patched together,

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,850
which could make wormholes possible.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,120
Let's see what that
would look like in two d.

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,070
Our universe is like a big flat
sheet bent in just the right way.

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,170
Wormholes could connect to very,

24
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,710
very distant spots with a short
bridge that you could cross almost

25
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:48,360
instantaneously enabling you to travel
the universe even faster than the speed

26
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,194
of light.

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,360
So where can we find a wormhole
presently only on paper?

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,630
General relativity says
they might be possible,

29
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,790
but that doesn't mean they have to exist.

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,000
General relativity is
a mathematical theory.

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,150
It's a set of equations that
have many possible answers,

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,220
but not all maths describes reality,
but they are theoretically possible.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,840
And there are different kinds.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,970
The first kind of wormholes to be
theorized where Einstein, Rosen bridges,

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,350
they describe every black hole as a
sort of portal to an infinite parallel

36
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:28,320
universe. Let's try to
picture them in two D. Again,

37
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,370
empty space time is flat
but curved by objects on it.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,900
If we compress that objects,
spacetime gets more curved around it.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,230
Eventually spacetime becomes so walked.

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,350
But it has no choice but to
collapse into a black hole.

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,380
A one way barrier forms the event horizon,
which anything can enter,

42
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,060
but nothing can escape trapped forever
at the singularity, at its core,

43
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,300
but maybe there is no singularity here.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,320
One possibility is that the other side
of the event horizon looks a bit like our

45
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,820
universe. Again, that
mirrored upside down.

46
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,650
Wet time runs backwards in our universe.

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,570
Things fall into the black hole in the
parallel universe with backwards time.

48
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,380
The mirror black hole is spewing
things out a bit like a big bag.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,460
This is called a white hole.
Unfortunately, Einstein,

50
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,470
Rosen bridges can't actually be crossed.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,580
It takes an infinite amount of time to
cross over to the opposite university and

52
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,030
they crimped shots in the middle.
If you go into a black hole,

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,350
you won't become the stuff coming out of
the Whitehall. You'll only become debt,

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,890
so to travel the cosmos
in the blink of an eye,

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,850
humans need a different kind of wormhole,
a traversable wormhole.

56
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,880
If string theory or one of its variations
is the correct description of our

57
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,640
universe,

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,800
then we could be lucky and our universe
might even have a tangled web of

59
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,270
countless wormholes already.

60
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,330
Shortly after the Big Bang
quantum fluctuations in the
universe at the smallest

61
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:07,300
scales far, far smaller than
an atom may have created. Many,

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,750
many traversable wormholes
threaded through them.

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,810
Our strings called cosmic strings in
the first billionth of a trillionth of a

64
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:20,200
second. After the Big Bang, the
ends of these tiny, tiny worm holes,

65
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,770
we'll pull the my chair's apart,
scattering them through the universe.

66
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,920
F wormholes were made
in the early universe,

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,590
whether with cosmic
strings or some other way,

68
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,040
they could be all over just
waiting to be discovered.

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,660
One might even be closer than
we realize from the outside.

70
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,360
Black holes and wormholes
can look very similar.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,560
Leading some physicists to suggest the
supermassive black holes in the center of

72
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,570
galaxies are actually wormholes.

73
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,560
It will be very hard to go all the way
to the center of the Milky Way to find

74
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,150
out though,
but that's okay.

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,890
There might be an equally extremely hard
way to get our hands on a worm hole.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,420
We could try to make one

77
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,660
to be traversable and useful.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,530
There are a few properties we
want a wormhole to have. First,

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
it must obviously connects to distant
parts of space time like your bedroom and

80
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,050
the bathroom or earth and Jupiter.

81
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,500
Second, it should not contain any event
horizons which would blog two way travel.

82
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,610
Third,

83
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,600
it should be sufficiently sized so that
the gravitational force is don't kill

84
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,530
human travelers.

85
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,340
The biggest problem we have to solve
is keeping our worm holes open.

86
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,600
No matter how we make wormholes,
gravity tries to close them.

87
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,740
Gravity wants to pinch it close
and cut the bridge. Leaving.

88
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,420
Oh need black holes at the ends.

89
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,370
Whether it's a traversable worm hole with
both hands and hours or a wormhole to

90
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:49,204
another universe,

91
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,220
it will try to close unless we have
something propping it open for very old

92
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,390
string theory worm holes.

93
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,390
That's the cosmic strings
job for manmade wormholes.

94
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,690
We need a new ingredient exotic matter.

95
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,710
This isn't anything like we find
on earth or even anti matter.

96
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,090
It's something totally new and different
and exciting with crazy properties like

97
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,700
nothing that's ever been seen before.

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,270
Exotic matter is stuff
that has a negative mass,

99
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,680
positive mass like people and planets
and everything else in the universe is

100
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,850
attractive because of gravity,
but negative mass would be repulsive.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,080
It would push you away. This makes a
kind of anti gravity that props open.

102
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:36,081
Our wormholes and exotic matter must
exert enormous pressure to push spacetime

103
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
open greater even than the pressure at
the centers of neutron stars with exotic

104
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,020
matter. We could weave space
time, however we see fit.

105
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,530
We may even have a candidate for this
exotic matter. The vacuum of space itself,

106
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,770
quantum fluctuations in empty space
constantly creating pairs of particles and

107
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:01,130
antiparticles only for them to be
at [inaudible] and instant later.

108
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,740
The vacuum of space is boiling with them
and we can already manipulate them to

109
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:10,220
produce an effect. Similar to the
negative mass were looking for.

110
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,700
We could use this to
stabilize our worm holes.

111
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,550
Once we're keeping it open,

112
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,960
the ends would start together so we'd
have to move them around to interesting

113
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:24,530
places.
We could start by wiring the Saudi system,

114
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,470
leaving one end of each worm
hole in orbit around the earth.

115
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,140
We could flag others into deep space.

116
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,710
The earth could be a wormhole hub for
a vast interstellar human civilization

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,730
spread over light shares, but
only a wormhole away. However,

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
wormholes have a dark site.

119
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,990
Even opening a single worm hole kind of
breaks the universe in fundamental ways,

120
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,430
potentially creating time travel paradox
is and violating the causal structure

121
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,264
of the universe.

122
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,520
Many scientists think that there's not
only means they should be impossible to

123
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:03,170
make, but that it's impossible for
them to exist at all. So for now,

124
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:07,490
we only know that wormholes exist in
our hearts and on paper in the form of

125
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:11,540
equations. We know you want to
know more about universe stuff.

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,160
So we're trying something
new codes Casandra and
brilliant to are collaborating

127
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,730
on a six part video series about our
favorite science and space things.

Thanks to their help.

129
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,680
There will be more videos on this
channel in the next six months.

130
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,270
[inaudible] has worked with brilliant
