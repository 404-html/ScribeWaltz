1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,260
There are probably 10,000 stars for
every grain of sand on earth in the

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,920
observable universe. We know that
there might be trillions of planets,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,180
so where are all the aliens?
This is the family, Tara dogs.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,950
If you want to know more about it,

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,810
watch part one here we look at possible
solutions to the family paradox,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,160
so will we be destroyed or does
a glorious future awaits us?

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,810
Space travel is hard over possible.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,540
It's an enormous challenge
to travel to other stars.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,680
Massive amounts of material had to
be put into orbit and assembled.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,570
A Journey of maybe thousands of years
needs to be survived by population big

11
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:49,250
enough to start from scratch and the
planet might not be as hospitable as it's

12
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,270
seen from afar.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,500
It was already extremely hard to set up
a spaceship that could survive the trip.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,270
An interstellar invasion might
be impossible to put off. Also,

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,870
consider timing.
The universe is a very old on honor.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,590
There's been life for at
least at 3.6 billion years,

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,370
intelligent human life
for about 250,000 years,

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,080
but only for about a century.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,560
Have we had the technology to
communicate over great distances.

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,360
There might have been grand alien empires
that stretched across thousands of

21
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:25,010
systems and existed for millions of years.
Let me, might just have missed them.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,300
There might be grandiose ruins
rotting away on distant worlds.

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,500
99% of all species on earth have died out.

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,070
It's easy to argue that this
will be our feet sooner or later.

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,410
Intelligent knife may develop,

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,180
spread over a few systems and
die off over and over again,

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,480
but to galactic civilizations
might never meet.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,740
So maybe it's a unifying experience
for life in the universe to look at the

29
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,660
stars and wonder where is everyone?

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,100
But there is no reason to assume that
aliens on my costs or that our logic

31
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,200
applies to them.

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,090
It might just be the town means of
communication are extremely primitive and

33
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,900
outdated. Imagine sitting in a
house with a Morse code transmitter.

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,730
You'd keep sending messages,

35
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,760
but liberty would answer and
you'd feel pretty lonely.

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,770
Maybe we're still undetectable for
intelligence species and will remain.

37
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:23,600
So until we learn to communicate
properly and even if we met aliens,

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,470
we might be too different to be able to
communicate with them in a meaningful

39
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:32,180
way. Imagine the smartest squirrel
you can, no matter how hard you try,

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,230
you won't be able to explain
our society to it. After all,

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,640
from the squirrels perspective,

42
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,730
a tree is all the day sophisticated
intelligence like itself needs to survive.

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,850
So she Linds,
cutting down whole forests is madness,

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,530
but we do destroy forests because we hate
squirrels. We just want the resources,

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,550
the squirrels wishes and the squirrels
survival are of no concern to us.

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,790
A type three civilizations in need of
resources may treat us in a similar way.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,690
They might just evaporate our oceans
to make collecting whatever they need

48
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,740
easier. One of the adience might
think for a second oh tiny. At Apes,

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,260
they build really cute
concrete structures.

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,620
Oh well now they're debt
before activating warp speed.

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,940
But if there is a civilization out there
that wants to eliminate other species,

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,690
it's a far more likely that it will
be motivated by culture rather than by

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
economics and anyway,

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,420
it will be more effective to automate
the process by constructing the perfect

55
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,410
weapon, a self replicating space
probe made from nano machines.

56
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,240
They operate on a molecular
level incredibly fast and
deadly with the power to

57
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,240
attack and dismantle
anything in an instant.

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,170
You only need to give them
four instructions. One,

59
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,370
find a planet with life to disassemble
everything on this planet into its

60
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,050
component parts.
Three,

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,010
use the resources to build
new space probes for repeat.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,080
A doomsday machine like this could
render a galaxy sterile in a few million

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,350
years,

64
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,040
but why would you fly in light years
to gather resources or commit genocide?

65
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,920
The speed of light is
actually not very fast.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
If someone could travel
at the speed of light,

67
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,920
it would still take 100,000 years to
cross the Milky Way once and you'll

68
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,450
probably travel way slower.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,130
There might be way more enjoyable
things than destroying civilizations and

70
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,910
building empires. An interesting
concept as the Matryoshka Brighton,

71
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,220
a mega structure surrounding a star,

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,380
a computer of such computing power that
an entire species could upload their

73
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,880
consciousness and exists in a simulated
universe potentially one could

74
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:38,350
experience and it Turnitin of pure
ecstasies without ever been bored or sad.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,470
A perfect life.
If built around a red dwarf,

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,860
this computer could be powered
for up to 10 trillion years.

77
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,060
Who would want to conquer the galaxy or
make contact with other life forms if

78
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,560
this were an option or these solutions
to the family paradox have one problem.

79
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,650
We don't know where the
borders of technology are.

80
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,980
We could be close to the limit or nowhere
near it and super technology awaits US

81
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,800
granting US immortality,
transporting us to other galaxies,

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
elevating us to the level of gods.

83
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,580
One thing we do have to acknowledge
is that we really don't know anything.

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,880
She have spent more than 90% of their
existence as hunter gatherers 500 years

85
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,430
ago. We thought we were the center
of the universe 200 years ago.

86
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,810
We stopped using human neighbor as the
main source of energy. 30 years ago,

87
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:29,110
we had apocalyptic weapons pointed
at each other because of political

88
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,730
disagreements in the galactic timescale.
We are embryos. We've come far,

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,560
but still have a long way to go.

90
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,150
The mindset that we are ready are the
center of the universe is still strong in

91
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:44,620
humans, so it's easy to make arrogant
assumptions about life in the universe,

92
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,040
but in the end, there's only
one way to find out, right?

93
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,683
Hey everybody,

94
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,010
we finally have our own sub
reddit come by for surveys,

95
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,010
discussions about future videos.
I think cues and stuff like that.

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,270
This video was made possible
by your support on Patrion.

97
