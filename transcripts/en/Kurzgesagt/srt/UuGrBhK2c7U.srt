1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,140
The ocean conveyor belt
and the Gulf stream.

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,460
Ocean currents have a direct
influence on our lives.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,880
They determine now whether our climate
and much more the ocean currents and wind

4
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:28,031
systems transport heat from the equator
to the polls and operate like a large

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,750
engine for the global climate.
In the oceans there are numerous currents.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,700
The so called ocean conveyor belt
is very important for our climate.

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,320
This term describes a combination of
currents that result in four of the five

8
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,720
global oceans exchanging
water with each other.

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,720
They form a worldwide segregation system.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,780
The conveyor belt is also called the
thermal halon circulation with thermo

11
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:57,680
referring to the temperature and he
to the salt content of the water.

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,330
Both determine the density of the water
while the masses of water maybe moved in

13
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,210
part by wind.

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,500
Primarily the different densities of the
global oceans are responsible for their

15
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,670
movement.
Warm water has a lower density and rises.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,070
Whoa.
Cold waters sinks.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,550
The water's density also increases with
the higher salt content at the equator.

18
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,540
The heat from the sun
is especially strong,

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,890
resulting in a lot of evaporation and
that's a rise in the water. Salt content.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,700
That is where the Gulf stream begins.

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,690
The Gulf Stream is very important
for the European climate.

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,110
It's length of 10,000 kilometers,

23
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:43,220
makes it one of the largest and fastest
ocean currents on earth and it's very

24
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:46,280
warm at roughly two meters a second.

25
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,290
It brings up to 100 million cubic meters
of water burst second towards Europe,

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,040
eight constantly blowing wind.

27
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,700
The southeast Tradewinds drives
warm surface water to the northwest,

28
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,750
into the Gulf of Mexico where it
heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,540
The turning of the earth and the West
winds then direct the Gulf stream towards

30
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,140
Europe and split it up.
One part flow south,

31
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,480
another east to the canary current
and a third part flows north where it

32
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,350
releases a lot of heat into the
atmosphere. As the North Atlantic current,

33
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,470
the water becomes colder there.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,970
It's salt content and identity density
rise on account of evaporation and it

35
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:33,680
drops down between Greenland,
Norway, and Iceland. There.

36
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:38,330
We also find the largest waterfall
on earth, the so called chimneys,

37
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,640
roughly 15 kilometer wide pillars
with water falling up to 4,000 meters,

38
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,390
17 million cubic meters of water per
second or roughly 15 times more water than

39
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,770
is carried by all the rivers in the world.

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,070
This creates a strong male strong,

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,350
which constantly pulls in new water and
is the reason that the Gulf stream moves

42
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,184
towards Europe.

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,390
Countless species use the Gulf stream
as a means of transport on their trips

44
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,220
from the Caribbean to northern areas,

45
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,440
but it doesn't just bring us animals and
enormous quantity of warmer also comes

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,100
with us.

47
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,310
In order to reduce the same heat which
it brings to the shores of Europe,

48
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,220
we would need 1 million
nuclear power plants.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,360
That's why we also call the Gulf
stream a heat pump. Without it,

50
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:26,320
the temperature would be significantly
colder here at these five to 10 degrees.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,910
Instead of lush fields,

52
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,120
we would have long winters and spouse
ice covered landscapes in Europe.

53
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,460
In the last few years,

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,420
scientists and pundits in the media have
repeatedly express the fear that the

55
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:42,421
Gulf stream could come to a standstill
due to climate change because if the

56
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,840
polar caps actually melt,

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,890
the salt content in the water off
Greenland would fall as what its density.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,140
The North Atlantic current would no
longer be heavy enough and so it wouldn't

59
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,710
sync as usual
in the worst case,

60
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,370
that would bring the Gulf
stream our heat pump to a stop.

61
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,740
Some climates experts also assume that
climate change could compensate for this

62
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,574
effect.

63
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,230
We know that it can be normal for the
climate to change by looking at the

64
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,140
development of the earth over
the last few million years,

65
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,540
there are ice ages and warm periods.
In the last ice age,

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,660
a gigantic flood of melting
water tripled the heat.

67
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:26,440
Bringing North Atlantic current
covering the northern hemisphere in ice.

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,170
Scientists have different views on the
impact that climate change will have on

69
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,880
the global ocean conveyor belt.

70
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,450
But one thing is clear
when the climate changes,

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,360
then the complex system of
ocean currents and winds,

72
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,270
which has remained fairly
stable since the last ice age,

73
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,270
will change in ways that
we don't yet understand.

74
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay.
