1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,440
A war has been raging
for billions of years,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,090
cunning trillions every single
day. Well, we don't even notice.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,830
The war is fought by the single
deadliest entity on our Panisse.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,070
The bacteria phage or Phage for short.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,840
A phage is a virus not quite alive,
not quite dead.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,080
Also,
they look as if someone made them up.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,920
The head is an icosahedron assault
of dice with 20 faces and 30 ages.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,390
It contains the genetic material of the
virus and often sits on a long tail that

9
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,590
has leg like fibers.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,540
There are more phages on earth
than every other organism combined,

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,860
including bacteria,
and they are probably everywhere.

12
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,150
Living things exist.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,150
Billions are on your hands and your
intestines and your eyelids right now,

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,890
which might make you nervous it since
features are responsible for the majority

15
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:10,650
of deaths on earth,
but you're lucky.

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,560
While they do commit
genocide for breakfast,

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,890
they only kill bacteria up to 40% of
all bacteria in the oceans are killed by

18
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,060
them every single day.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,010
But features also have major
floors like any other virus.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,510
Pleasers need a host to
survive and reproduce.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,810
They're not much more than genetic
material in a hole and they specialize.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,090
Usually a phage has chosen one specific
bacteria and maybe some of it's very

23
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:42,240
close relatives.
These are its prey.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,370
Imagine a Phage eyes like a cruise missile
that only hunts and kills members of

25
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:51,900
one very unlucky family.
When a phage finds its victim,

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,770
it connects it's towel fibers with
receptors and uses a sort of syringe to

27
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,260
puncture the surface in a weird motion.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,370
The phages squeezes it's tail and
injects its genetic information.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,730
Within minutes the bacteria is taken over.

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,810
It's now forced to manufacture
all the parts of new phages.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,460
They only stop when the bacteria
is filled up with brand new phages.

32
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,610
In the final step,
they produce an ender license,

33
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,880
a powerful enzyme that punches
a hole in the bacteria.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,760
The pressure is so high that
the bacteria sort of calm,

35
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,000
it's out all of its insights and dies.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,530
New Features are released
and begin the cycle anew.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,540
In the last few years,

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,190
bacteria phages have enjoyed the intention
of the second Deb DSP beings on earth.

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Schumann's recently we've started looking
into injecting millions of them into

40
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,670
our bodies because we're sort of
getting desperate. We screwed up

41
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,040
in the past. A single cart or set
from the wrong puddle could kill you.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,260
Bacteria were our phages tiny
monsters that hunted us mercilessly.

43
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,880
But about 100 years ago,
we found a solution in nature by accident,

44
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,560
we found funky that produced a compound
that kills bacteria, antibiotics.

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,500
Suddenly we had a powerful super weapon.

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,170
Antibiotics was so effective that we
stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,260
Only the old and the weakest
among us were killed by them.

48
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,570
We used antibiotics more and more
for less and less serious causes.

49
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,650
We lost respect for the
monsters and the weapon,

50
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,350
but bacteria are living things that evolve
and one by one they started to become

51
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,820
immune against our ovens.

52
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,590
This continued until we had
created what are called super bugs,

53
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,890
bacteria,
immune to almost everything we have.

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,360
This immunity is spreading
across the world as we speak.

55
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,980
By 2050 superbugs could kill
more humans a year than cancer.

56
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,930
The days when a cart or bladder infection
or a cough could kill you or your

57
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,931
loved ones are coming back in the u s
alone more than 23,000 people die from

58
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,670
resistant bacteria each year,

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,200
but it turns out that phages our tiny
killer virus robots could save us.

60
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,700
We could inject them into our bodies
to help cure infections. Hold on.

61
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,560
How could injecting millions of viruses
into an infection be a good idea?

62
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,700
Phages are very,
very specialized killers of bacteria,

63
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,930
so specialized in face that humans
are completely immune to them.

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,640
We are two different,

65
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,780
we encounter billions of phages
every day and we just pull nightly,

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,880
ignore each other.
Antibiotics are like a carpet bombing,

67
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,080
killing everything.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,710
Even the good bacteria in our
intestines that we don't want to harm.

69
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,670
Phages are like guided missiles that only
attack what they're supposed to wait a

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,500
minute is if we use phages to kill
bacteria when bacteria develop ways of

71
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:03,160
defending themselves. Well,
it's more complex than that.

72
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,990
Phages evolve too.

73
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,630
There has been an arms race between Batman
bacteria for billions of years and so

74
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,070
far they're doing great.

75
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,740
This makes phages smart weapons that are
constantly getting better at killing,

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,860
but even if bacteria were to become
immune against how phage we still might be

77
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,694
able to win.

78
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,650
It turns out that in order to become
resistance to even just a few species of

79
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,240
phages bacteria have to give up
their resistance to antibiotics,

80
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,140
we might be able to
trap them in a catch 22

81
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,470
this has already been successfully tested
with a patient who had no other hope

82
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,040
left the bacteria pseudomonas Aeruginosa,

83
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,880
one of the most feared bacteria
infected the man's chest cavity.

84
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,010
They are naturally resistant to most
antibiotics and can even survive an

85
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,220
alcoholic hand gel.
After years of suffering,

86
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,330
a few thousand features were directly
inserted into his chest cavity.

87
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,100
Together with antibiotics, the bacteria
were immune to. After a few weeks,

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,270
the infections had completely disappeared.
Unfortunately,

89
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,740
this treatment is still experimental and
Pharma companies are still reluctant to

90
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:23,030
invest the necessary billions
in a treatment that has
no official approval yet,

91
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,210
but things are finally changing.

92
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,780
In 2016 the largest phage clinical trial
to date began and phages are getting

93
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,941
more and more attention and we better
get used to it because the era in which

94
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,000
antibiotics have been our super
weapon is drawing to a close.

95
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,150
It might be a weird concept,

96
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,450
but injecting the deadliest
being on planet earth
directly into our bodies could

97
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,590
save millions of lives.
