1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,500
What is hydraulic
fracturing? Oh, fracking.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,110
Since the industrial revolution, our
energy consumption has risen unceasingly.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,800
The majority of this energy consumption
is supplied by fossil fuels like coal or

4
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,600
natural gas.
Recently,

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,870
there's been a lot of talk about a
controversial method of extracting natural

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,440
gas,
hydraulic fracturing or fracking.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,151
Put simply,

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,140
fracking describes the recovery of natural
gas from deep layers inside the earth.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,830
In this method, porous rock is
fractured buddy use of water, sand,

10
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:38,000
and chemicals in order to
release the enclosed natural gas.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,560
The technique of fracking has
been known since the 1940s

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,380
nonetheless, only in the last 10 years
has there been quite a fracking boom,

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,300
especially in the USA.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,980
This is because most conventional
natural gas sources in America and on the

15
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,170
European continent have been exhausted.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,510
Vast prices for natural gas and
other fuels are rising steadily,

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,020
significantly more
complicated and expensive.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,830
Methods like fracking have now
become attractive and profitable.

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,623
In the meantime,

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,710
fracking has already been used more
than a million times in the USA alone.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,830
Over 60% of all new oil and gas
wells are drilled by using fracking.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,410
Now let's take a look at how
fracking actually works. First,

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,090
the shaft is drilled several hundred
meters into the earth. From there,

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,720
they horizontal hole is drilled
into the gas bearing layer of rock.

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,970
Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into
the ground using high performance pumps.

26
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,860
On average, the fluid consists
of 8 million liters of water,

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,160
which amounts to about the daily
consumption of 65,000 people plus several

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,440
thousand tons of sand and about
200,000 liters of chemicals.

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,450
The mixture penetrates into the rock
layer and producers in numerable tiny

30
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:03,860
cracks. The sand prevents the
cracks from closing. Again,

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,220
the chemicals perform various tasks. Among
other things, they compress the water,

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,260
kill off bacteria or dissolve minerals.
Next,

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,120
the majority of the fracking fluid is
pumped out again and now the natural gas

34
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:24,170
can be recovered as soon as
the gas source is exhausted,

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,020
the drill hole is sealed.
As a rule,

36
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,980
the fracking fluid is pumped back into
deep underground layers and sealed in

37
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,110
there.
However,

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,590
fracking is also associated
with several considerable risks.

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,520
The primary risk consist in the
contamination of drinking water sources.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,110
Fracking not only consumes
large quantities of fresh
water, but in addition,

41
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,560
the water is subsequently
contaminated and is highly toxic.

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,630
The contamination is so severe that
the water cannot even be cleaned in a

43
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,464
treatment plant

44
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,880
even though the danger is known and
theoretically could managed in the USA

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,360
already sources have been
contaminated due to negligence.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,150
No one yet knows how the enclosed water
will behave in the future since they

47
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,970
have not yet been any long
term studies on the subject.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,880
The chemicals used in fracking very from
the hazardous to the extremely toxic

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,080
and carcinogenic such as
benzol or formic acid.

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,290
The company's using fracking and say
nothing about the precise composition of

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,340
the chemical mixture,

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,700
but it is known that there are about 700
different chemical agents which can be

53
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,840
used in the process.

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,920
Another risk is the release
of greenhouse gases.

55
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,260
The natural gas recovered by
fracking consists largely of methane,

56
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,880
a greenhouse gas, which is 25 times
more potent than carbon dioxide.

57
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,250
Natural gas is less harmful than
coal when burned, but nonetheless,

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,120
the negative effects of fracking or the
climate balance, our overall greater,

59
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,580
firstly, the fracking process requires
a very large consumption of energy.

60
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,740
Certainly the drill holes are quickly
exhausted and it's necessary to drill.

61
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,580
Fracking holds much more frequently
than for classical natural gas wells.

62
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,703
In addition,

63
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,300
about 3% of the recovered gas is lost
in the extraction and escapes into the

64
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,134
atmosphere.

65
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,510
So how is fracking and its
expected benefits to be
assessed when the advantages

66
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:32,710
are balanced against the
disadvantages when properly employed?

67
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,450
This technique offers one way in the short
to medium term to meet our demand for

68
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,530
lower cost energy.

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,550
But the longterm consequences of fracking
are unforeseeable and the risk to our

70
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,370
drinking water thus should
not be underestimated.
