1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,640
Humans love meat, steak, fried
chicken, bacon, pork belly,

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,370
and sausages are just the best things.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,570
Eating meat has become so trivial that
many people don't consider something a

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,790
proper meal if there's no animal involved,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,650
which is pretty amazing since
only a few decades ago meet.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,460
It was a luxury product. Today you
can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,310
Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the
most inefficient way of feeding humans.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,740
If we look at it on a global scale,

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,130
our meaty diet is literally
eating up the planet.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,110
Why is that and what can we do
about it without giving up steak?

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,990
Humans keep a lot of animals for food.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,870
Currently about 23 billion chickens,

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,550
1.5 billion cattle and roughly
1 billion and pigs and sheep,

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,920
that's a lot of mouths to feed,

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,370
so we've transformed earth
into a giant feeding ground.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
83% of it's farmland is used for my stock.
For example,

17
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,740
his posture and to farm fodder
crops like corn and soy.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,580
That's 26% of earth's total land area.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,550
If we include the water
we need for these plants,

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,680
meat and dairy production accounts for
27% of global fresh water consumption.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,110
Unfortunately, meat production is
like a black hole for resources.

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,960
Since animals are living things,

23
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,170
most of their food is used to
keep them alive while they grow.

24
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:42,171
They're tasty parts only a fraction of
the nutrients from fodder crops and up in

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,560
the meat we buy in the
end. Cows, for example,

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,740
convert only about 4% of the proteins
and 3% of the calories of the plants we

27
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,580
feed to them into beef.

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,750
More than 97% of the
calories are lost to us

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,310
to create one kilogram of steak account
needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and

30
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:08,490
uses up to 15,000 liters of water.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,970
Animal products that aren't
guzzling up tons of food,

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,300
but they only make up 18% of the calories
humans eat according to projections.

33
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,680
We could nourish an additional 3.5
billion people if we just ate the stuff we

34
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:27,681
feed to animals to make our favorite
food group even more unsustainable.

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,000
About 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions
caused by humans are created by the

36
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,630
meat industry as much as by all ships,
planes,

37
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:41,430
trucks and cars combined.
And there's another aspect to meet.

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,750
It comes from actual living
beings, pigs, cattle and chicken.

39
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,430
A lot love the ones
writing the history books,

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,520
but if they were humans would appear as
ramping genocidal maniacs that thrive on

41
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,050
suffering globally.

42
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,350
We kill about 200 million
animals every day,

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,270
about 74 billion a year.

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
This means that every one and a half years
we kill more animals than people have

45
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:11,410
lived in the entire 200,000
year history of humanity.

46
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,820
One could argue that we're
doing them a favor after all.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,660
They wouldn't exist without us.
We might eat them in the end,

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,530
but we also provide food and shelter
and the gift of existence to them

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,980
unfortunately were not very nice gods.

50
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,310
A lot of our meat comes
from factory farms,

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,320
huge industrial systems that house
thousands of animals and Genea to be as

52
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,520
efficient as possible. They have little
regard for things like quality of life.

53
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Most pigs are raised in gigantic window
less sheds and never get to see the sun

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,901
sow's.

55
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:51,040
Our captain pans too small to turn around
where they give birth to one litter of

56
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,670
piglets after another until it's
their turn to be turned into Bacon.

57
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,260
Dairy cows are forced to breed
continually to ensure their milk supply,

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,500
but are separated from their carves
hours after birth to fastener beef cattle

59
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,500
for slaughter.

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,060
They're put in feedlots confined pens
where they can't roam and put on weight

61
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:14,530
more quickly to make it possible to keep
them so tightly together without dying

62
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,900
of diseases.
The majority of antibiotics,

63
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:21,901
we use our for livestock up to 80% in
the u s which helps in the short term but

64
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,750
also fuels antibiotic resistances,

65
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,150
but the ones that may have got the worst
deal. Our chickens in factory farms,

66
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,410
they're kept in such vast numbers and
so close to each other that they can't

67
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:37,630
form the social structures
they have in nature,

68
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,520
so they start attacking each other to
stop that. We cut their beaks and clause.

69
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,200
Male chickens are deemed worthless
since they can't lay eggs and are not

70
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,380
suitable for me. Production.
So within minutes after birth,

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,170
they're usually gassed and shredded.
In grinders,

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,400
several hundred million baby chickens
are killed this way each year.

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,030
Even if you had a personal
score to settle with chickens,

74
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,640
how we treat them is beyond broken,

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,620
so better buy organic meats where
animals are treated nicely, right?

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,390
Organic farming regulations are designed
to drive to animals a minimum of

77
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,224
comfort.

78
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,500
The problem is that organic is an elastic
term according to EU regulations and

79
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,400
organic hen still might share one
square meter of space with five others.

80
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,370
That's a long way off from
happy farmyard chickens.

81
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,840
Farms that sincerely do their
best do exist of course,

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,240
but meat is still a business and organic
label is a way to charge more money and

83
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,900
countless scandals have revealed producers
looking for ways to cheat the system.

84
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,200
And while organic meat
might be less cruel,

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,770
it needs even more resources than
conventional meat production.

86
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,230
So buying organic is still preferable
but does not grant you moral absolution.

87
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,740
The truth is if suffering,
we're a resource,

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,570
we would create billions
of tons of it per year.

89
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,280
The way we treat animals will probably
be one of the things future generations

90
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,570
will look down on in disgust.
While all these things are true,

91
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,640
something else is true to
steak is amazing. Burgers,

92
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,080
other best food, chicken
wings, tastes great. Meet,

93
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,870
satisfies something buried
deep in our lizard brain.

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,580
We hardly ever see how our meat is made.
We just eat it and love it.

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,470
It creates joy. It brings us together
for family meals and barbecue parties.

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,170
Eating meat doesn't make you a bad person.

97
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,420
Not eating meat doesn't
make you a good one.

98
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,680
Life is complicated and so
is the world we've created.

99
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,790
So how should we deal with the fact that
meat is extremely unsustainable and a

100
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,800
sort of horrible torture?
For now,

101
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,500
the easiest option is
opting out more often.

102
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Taking a meat free day per week
already makes a difference.

103
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,220
If you want to eat meat
produced with less suffering,

104
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,370
try to buy from trusted producers
with a good track record,

105
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,750
even if it costs more to make
an impact on the environment.

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,520
Go for chicken and pig rather than lamb
and beef as they convert their feed more

107
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,390
efficiently and to beat.
And if you're going to have your steak,

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,310
you should eat it to an average American
throws out nearly a pound of food per

109
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:24,200
day. A lot of which is meet in the
future science could get as clean,

110
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:29,201
makes various startups have successfully
grown meat and labs and are working on

111
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:31,160
doing so on a commercial scale.

112
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,570
But solutions like this are
still a few years away for now.

113
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Enjoy a steak but also respect it and
if you can make it something special

114
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,464
again,

115
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,430
we have something else for you that's
also special and tastes even better than

116
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:53,610
steak.
We get asked a lot how we make our videos.

117
