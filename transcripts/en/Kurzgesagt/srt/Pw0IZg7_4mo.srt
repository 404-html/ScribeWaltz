1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,680
The moons of Mars explained.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,730
Mars has two Boone's Phobos and Deimos.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,040
They are really tiny.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,440
How tiny compared to Mars or our own moon?
Pretty tiny,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,300
although tiny, is a
matter of opinion. There.

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:23,470
Surface areas or close to some of the
smallest states on earth like Luxembourg

7
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:27,940
and Malta or their Phobos and
[inaudible] are in no way lightweight.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,871
In reality,

9
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:32,440
their gravitational pull isn't even
strong enough to bring them into spherical

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,160
form, so they look more like
huge potatoes than moons.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,020
The most popular theory of that origin
is that they were once part of the

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,050
asteroid belt until Jupiter's massive
gravity kick them out of it so Mars could

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,703
catch them.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,140
Phobos orbits Mars as an average
distance of 9,400 kilometers.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,090
Once every seven and a half hours,

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,660
it's on a collision course and gets two
meters close to Mars every year in 50 to

17
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,890
100 million years.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,160
It will either be ripped to pieces by
Mars is gravity and be transformed into a

19
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,500
beautiful ring or it will crash into Mars.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,580
The energy released in this
collision would kill everything
on the small Panisse.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,520
So if there are humans on Mars,
by then,

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,500
they should build very strong bunkers.
Smaller diamonds, on the other hand,

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,510
is slowly escaping Mars.

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,760
Eventually it will fly off into space
and leave a lonely rev planet behind.

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,190
So in a few hundred million years,
Mars will be moonless and on its own,

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,600
unless it manages to catch itself.
Another asteroid.
