1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,240
Have you ever been in an
argument about nuclear power?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,660
We have and we found it
frustrating and confusing,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,090
so let's try and get to
grips with this topic.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,433
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,390
It all started in the 1940s after the
shock and horror of the war and they use

6
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:21,260
of the atomic bomb.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,550
Nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful
spinoff of the new technology helping

8
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,080
the world get back on its feet.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,910
Everyone's imagination was running
wild wood and electricity become free.

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,580
Could nuclear power help
settle the Antarctic?

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,420
Would there be nuclear powered
cars, planes, or houses?

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,870
It seemed that this was just
a few years of hard work away.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,800
One thing was setting
the future was a tonic.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,930
Just a few years later, there was a sort
of atomic age hangover. As it turned out,

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,170
nuclear power was a very complicated
and very expensive turning physics into

16
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:00,710
engineering. Was it easy on paper,
but hard in real life? Also,

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,910
private companies thought that nuclear
power was much too risky as an investment.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,390
Most of them would much rather
stick with gas, coal, and oil.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,780
But there were many people who didn't
just want to abandon the promise of the

20
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,210
atomic age and exciting new technology,

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,730
the prospect of enormously
cheap electricity,

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,880
the prospect of being independent oil
and gas in boards and in some cases a

23
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:26,750
secret desire to possess
the atomic weapons provided
a strong motivation to keep

24
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,584
going.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Nuclear powers at finest hour finally
came in the early 1970s when war in the

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,040
Middle East cause to oil prices
to skyrocket worldwide. Now,

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,780
commercial interest and investment
picked up at eight dazzling pace.

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,290
More than half of all the nuclear reactors
in the world were built between 1970

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,150
and 1985 but which type of reactor to
build given how many different types there

30
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:54,140
were to choose from. And he surprising
underdog candidate won the day.

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,700
The light water reactor.

32
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,750
It wasn't very innovative and it
wasn't too popular with scientists,

33
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
but it had some decisive advantages.
It was there,

34
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,050
it works and it wasn't terribly expensive.
So what doesn't like water?

35
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:11,660
He had to do well.
The basic principle is shockingly simple.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,050
It heats up water using an
artificial chain reaction.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,700
Nuclear Fission release is several million
times more energy than any chemical

38
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,534
reaction could.

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,980
Really heavy elements on the brink of
stability like uranium two three five get

40
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:28,070
bombarded with neutrons.
The neutrons is absorbed,

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,310
but the result is
unstable most of the time.

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,250
It immediately splits into
fast moving laser elements,

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,540
some additional free neutrons and
energy in the form of radiation.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,210
The radiation heat to the
surrounding water, well,

45
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:45,170
the neutrons repeat the process with
other items releasing more neutrons and

46
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,870
radiation in a closely
controlled chain reaction.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Very different from the first destructive
runaway reaction in an atomic bomb in

48
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,980
our light water reactor, a moderator is
needed to control the neutrons energy.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Simple ordinary water does the job,

50
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,090
which is very practical since water's
used to drive the turbines anyway,

51
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,770
the light water reactor became prevalent
because it's simple and cheap. However,

52
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,210
it's neither the safest, most efficient
nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,050
The renewed nuclear hype
lasted barely a decade though.

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,320
In 1979 the three mile island nuclear
plant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a

55
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,190
catastrophe when it's core melted.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,810
In 1986 the Chernobyl catastrophe
directly threatened central Europe with a

57
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,800
radioactive cloud.

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,040
And in 2011 the drawn out
Fukushima disaster sparks
new discussions and concerns

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,740
while in the 1980s 218 new nuclear power
reactors when live their number and

60
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:46,861
nuclear as global share of electricity
production has stagnated since the end of

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,530
the eighties so what's the
situation today? Today,

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,620
nuclear energy meets around 10% of the
world's energy demand that are about 439

63
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,050
nuclear reactors in 31 countries.

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,520
About 70 new reactors aren't under
construction in 2015 most of the men

65
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,010
countries, which are
growing quickly, all in all,

66
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,460
116 new reactors are planned worldwide.

67
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,540
Most new via reactors were built
more than 25 years ago with Prezi.

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,550
Old Technology, more than 80% are
various types of light water reactor.

69
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,640
Today.
Many countries are faced with a choice,

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,200
the expensive replacement of the aging
renters possibly with more efficient but

71
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:31,060
less tested models or a move away from
nuclear power towards newer or older

72
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,210
technology with different cost
and environmental impacts.

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,880
So should we use nuclear energy?

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,990
The pro and contra arguments
will be presented here next week.
