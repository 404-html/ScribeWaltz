1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,981
Homeopathy,

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,880
maybe the most controversial but also
the most popular alternative medicine

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,550
while some argue against it, others swear
by it's great power and effectiveness.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,950
How does homeopathy work?

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,120
How did it become what it is today and
what can modern medicine none from it.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,030
The first principle of homeopathy
is a blank cures like remedies using

7
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,180
ingredients that caused the symptoms
you want to kill in practice.

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,450
That means that remedies
against fever could for example,

9
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,330
be made from Bella Donna,
which also causes fever.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,130
A mixture based from be venom is used
to treat ECI swellings and so on.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,480
The second principle is a special method
of preparation called potentialization.

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,550
The idea is that diluting and agitating
the ingredients activates their curative

13
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,820
powers and enhances their effect.
To do this,

14
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,730
the ingredient is dissolved
in alcohol or distilled water.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,500
Homeopaths take one part of the solution
and mix it with nine parts of water,

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,430
diluting it down to one 10th of its
original concentration and shaking it.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,610
What you have now is a one x potency,

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,380
one part ingredient and my part solvent
named after the Roman numeral x for 10

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,340
now this process is repeated.
Take one part,

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,320
mix it with nine parts of pure water and
shake it vigorously. Now you have two x,

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,760
you do this again and again until you
reach the desired grade of potency.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,600
The finished remedy is then taken orally
or sometimes it's applied as little

23
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,340
sugar packet that are sold as
globally. A 20 x potency, for example,

24
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,970
is like dissolving one aspirin pill in
the water volume of the whole Atlantic,

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,010
but many are much more extreme
length. 30 see, for example,

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,330
c means that the mixture has one
part ingredient and 99 parts water,

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,930
so the commonly sold 30 see mixture means
that one part ingredient and 1 million

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,440
billion, billion, billion, billion,
billion, billion parts of water.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,090
If we wanted a globally pill with a single
atom of the original ingredient than

30
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,480
our pill would be the diameter of the
distance between the earth and the sun.

31
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,100
150 million kilometers uphill,

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,920
so massive that it would collapse
into a black hole under its own mass.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,730
Because of this potentaty [inaudible]
is one of the biggest criticisms of

34
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,650
homeopathy. The extreme
dilution is supposed to make
the ingredients more potent,

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,770
but on a physical level,
this doesn't really make sense.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,810
Most homeopathic remedies aren't diluted
so much that not a single atom of the

37
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,430
active ingredient is left in the,

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,260
the explanation of why the mixture still
work is that shaking them extra after

39
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:50,910
every dilution leaves behind a spirit,
like essence of the ingredient.

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
Basically. The idea is that ought
to remembers what was put into it.

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,640
But if this were true,

42
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,940
then every substance that ever a drop
of water would leave the essence behind

43
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,630
and lead to unpredictable effects
when it was accidentally ingested.

44
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,440
Think of all the stuff that
lives in floats in the oceans.

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,190
Every sip of water would be a
supercharged homeopathic cocktail.

46
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,390
So how did homeopathy become the
most successful alternative medicine?

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,220
And the 18th century medicine
was very different from today.

48
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,110
Treatments like bloodletting left the
patient worse off than before. So,

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,500
and physicians are unwell.
Honamin wanted a noninvasive,

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,970
natural way of healing and
developed homeopathy. And in fact,

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,150
homeopathic hospitals were soon successful
because doing no harm beats doing

52
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,020
harm. Honoman imposed very strict
rules on his patients. First,

53
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,550
you had to avoid coffee, tea,
alcohol, spicy foods, sweet fruit,

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,990
no old cheese, no onions, no meat,
no clothes made from sheep's wool,

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,550
but also know sedentary work, low sitting
inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms,

56
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,880
no riding horses, no
napping, no playing games,

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,380
no masturbation and of course no reading,
pornographic tax and many more.

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,550
Then and only then would his remedies
work according to the inventor of

59
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,100
homeopathy.
Of course,

60
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,640
all of these instructions are
ignored and not talked about today.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,510
Medicine has changed a
lot in the last 150 years.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,070
Never before in human history have we
enjoyed a comparable level of health.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
Never have we lived as long and this
is largely due to the new tools we've

64
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,990
developed.
Modern Diagnostics,

65
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,070
double blinded studies and scientific
evaluation to check and to prove which

66
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:40,270
stuff works. Thanks to these tools.
After countless studies and reviews,

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,440
we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
homeopathy does not have any effect

68
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,850
beyond placebo. But even
so, who cares why it works?

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
If it helps people,

70
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,730
maybe you tried it and felt better or
you know someone that got over a horrible

71
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,000
disease while using homeopathic remedies
and there are plenty of reports of it

72
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:02,950
working for children and animals.
What do we make of these experiences?

73
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,820
The placebo effect is very
real and not imaginary.

74
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,790
No matter how smart you are,
you're not immune to it.

75
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,940
If people believe that something
will help them feel better,

76
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,500
their trust alone has the desired effect
and it's been proven that the placebo

77
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,760
effect can be transferred.

78
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,350
Children and animals rely on their parents
or keep us and are in tune to their

79
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:27,640
emotions. If a parent has a lot of
trust and a treatment and it eases up,

80
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,640
this can help a child relax
and help relieve symptoms.

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,560
This could also be observed with animals
who react strongly to the body language

82
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,180
cues of the people caring for them,

83
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,200
but the most powerful tool
of homeopathy is time.

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,270
Our bodies are survival
machines. Infections pass on
their own after a few days,

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,140
but if you take some remedy when you
already feel sick and then start getting

86
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,900
better, it feels like it
did indeed kill you. Well,

87
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,610
actually it would have happened anyway.

88
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,240
The homeopathy industry likes to play
the gentle alternative to big Pharma,

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,270
but the homeopathic
industry is big Pharma.

90
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,660
Billions of dollars are made
with extreme profit margins.

91
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,550
The homeopathy industry has its own lobby
organizations and fights its enemies

92
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,630
as hard as it can. A lot of
money is on the line. Globally.

93
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,810
The market is expected to reach over 17
billion by 2020 for some critics even

94
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,250
argue that the homeopathic industry is
bad for public health because it creates

95
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,840
distrust and proven medicine.

96
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,700
The belief in homeopathy correlates
with skepticism about vaccinations.

97
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,140
This can discourage people to seek the
help they need when their lives or the

98
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,910
lives of their children are on the line,

99
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,570
but there is actually a key to the
success of homeopathy that we could and

100
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,624
should copy.

101
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,760
The first consultation with a homeopath
can take hours and is very personal.

102
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,570
For a patient who's already been on
a pilgrimage from doctors, a doctor,

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,350
this level of attention and empathy
can make a huge difference to their

104
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,830
wellbeing even if the conversation
was not the point of the therapy.

105
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,110
Modern medicine is efficient.
It saves millions of lives each year,

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,280
but it's also a strictly
organized system type. Budgets,

107
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,190
forced doctors and nurses to
deal with lots of patients.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Consultations need to be time efficient.
Diagnoses made quickly,

109
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,220
treatments fast, which can leave
patients feeling invisible,

110
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,290
scared and left behind.

111
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,500
This is what modern medicine
can learn from homeopathy.

112
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,490
It meets a human need that
has been left unfulfilled.

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,320
We need to make time for the individual
again, see people, not numbers,

114
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,510
but as important as empathy is. It's
not a substitute for actual treatment.

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,940
Faith can move mountains, but
sugar, water can't cure cancer.

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,240
After a short break of a few years
could cause. Alta is back in Jevon.

117
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,490
Thanks to the support of funk.

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,330
We have relaunched the German channel
and are beginning to upload a video every

119
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:03,810
one to two weeks.
Besides redoing our favorite videos,

120
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,440
there'll be a number of videos that
will not exist in English for a while.

121
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,090
Check out the channel here. Tell us what
you think, and subscribe and wash a few.

122
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,520
If the channel goes well,

123
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,310
the German videos might become
a regular thing for years,

124
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,530
and we might even do more languages.
