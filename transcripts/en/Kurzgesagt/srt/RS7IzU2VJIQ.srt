1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,630
When the gods granted King Midas one wish.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,050
He wished that everything he
touched would turn to gold.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,300
Midas was delighted trees,
rocks, buildings, all gold.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,890
But soon he found in horror that
his foods turned into gold as well.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,950
When he hugged his daughter
to soothe his pain,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,440
he realized his mistake too late.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,070
The richest man in existence was starving,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,630
heartbroken and alone.
Humanity got us similar.

9
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:35,370
Wish granted when we learned how to
turn Brown, stinky goose into magic,

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,720
plastic, cheap, sterile and convenient.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,460
It changed our lives,

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,570
but this wonder of technology
got a little out of hand.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,750
Plastic has saturated our environment.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,110
It has invaded the animals we eat and
now it's finding its way into our bodies,

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,650
his plastic.
For most of our history,

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,930
humans use stuff we found in nature
to build the things we need it.

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,860
But the invention of plastic
roughly 100 years ago,

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,540
completely changed our world.
Plastic is made from polymers,

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,530
long repeating chains of
molecule groups and nature.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,480
Polymers exist everywhere.
The walls of cells, silk hat,

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,270
insect,
carapaces DNA,

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,140
but it's also possible to create them
by breaking down crude all into its

23
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:42,130
components. And rearranging them.
We can form new synthetic polymers.

24
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,620
Synthetic polymers have extraordinary
traits. They are lightweight, durable,

25
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,300
and can be molded into almost any shape,
not requiring time consuming.

26
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,134
Manual work.

27
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,290
Plastic can be easily mass produced and
it's raw materials are available in vast

28
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,550
amounts and incredibly cheaply.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,970
And so the golden era of plastics began.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,830
Bakelite was used for mechanical parts,
PVC for plumbing,

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,660
electric guitars and cases,

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,170
acrylic as a shatter resistant alternative
to glass and nylon stockings and war

33
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:20,710
equipment. Today almost everything
is at least partly made from plastic.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,850
Our clothes, phones, computers,
furniture, appliances,

35
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:29,620
houses and cars. Plastic has long
ceased to be a revolutionary material.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,550
Instead it became trash, coffee cups,
plastic bags or stuffed a rapper.

37
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,400
Banana. We don't think about this factor.
Lot plastic just appears and goes away.

38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,350
Unfortunately it doesn't
sense.

39
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,150
Synthetic polymers are so durable.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,230
Plastic takes between
501,000 years to break down,

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,420
but somehow we collectively decided
to use this super tough material.

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,280
The things meant to be thrown away.

43
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,090
40% plastics are used for packaging in
the u s packaging makes up one third of

44
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,250
all the waste that is generated annually.
Since its invention,

45
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,810
we have produced about 8.3
billion metric tons of plastic,

46
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,770
335 million tons in 2016 alone,

47
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,370
more than 6.3 billion metric tons of
plastic have become waste since 1907 piled

48
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:29,851
up in one place that makes a cube
with a side length of 1.9 kilometers.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,410
So what did we do with all this waste?
9% was recycled,

50
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,900
12% burned,
but 79% of it is sticking around.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Still a lot ends up in the ocean
around 8 million tons a year.

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
That's so much plastic that it will
outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050

53
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,270
because it's everywhere.

54
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,510
Marine animals keep getting trapped
in plastic and swallowing it.

55
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,160
In 2015 already,
90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,780
Many animals, staff with stomach's
full of indigestible trash.

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,440
In 2018 a dead sperm
whale washed up in Spain.

58
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,240
He had eaten 32 kilos of
plastic bags, nats, and a drum.

59
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,620
While this is tragic and makes
for great magazine covers,

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
there's an even more widespread in
visible form of plastic microplastics.

61
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,060
Microplastics are pieces
smaller than five millimeters.

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,570
Some of them are used in
cosmetics or toothpaste,

63
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,910
but most result from floating waste that
is constantly exposed to UV radiation

64
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,730
and crumbles into smaller
and smaller pieces.

65
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,220
51 trillion such particles float in the
ocean where they are even more easily

66
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,380
swallowed by all kinds of marine life.

67
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,410
This has raised concerns among scientists,

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,950
especially about health risks from the
chemicals that are added to plastic.

69
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,730
BPA for example,
makes plastic bottles transparent,

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,210
but there's also evidence that it
interferes with our hormonal system.

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,100
Dehp makes plastics more
flexible but may cause cancer.

72
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,530
It would be pretty bad if microplastics
are toxic because they travel up the

73
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,950
food chain.
Zero plankton eat micro plastic.

74
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,760
Small fish eat zooplankton,
so do oysters,

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,980
crabs and predatory fish and
they all land and our plates.

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,050
Micro plastics have been found in honey,

77
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,610
in Cecil and bear in tap
water and in the household.

78
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:34,510
Dust around us.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,270
Eight out of 10 babies and nearly all
adults have measurable amounts of fights.

80
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,330
A common plastic additive in their bodies
and 93% of people have BPA in their

81
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:49,330
urine.
There is little sons about this so far,

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,400
and right now it's inconclusive.

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,640
We need a lot more research
before panic is justified,

84
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,930
but it is safe to say that
a lot of happened that we
didn't plan for and we have

85
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:04,310
lost control over plastic to assess
the extent, which is kind of scary,

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,510
but just to make sure we should
simply band plastics. Right?

87
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,990
Unfortunately,
it's a bit more complicated than that.

88
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,100
Plastic pollution is not the only
environmental challenge we face.

89
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,810
Some of the substitutes we'd use for
plastic have a higher environmental impact

90
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,060
in other ways.
For example,

91
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,380
according to a recent study by the Danish
government making a single use plastic

92
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:32,330
bag requires so little energy and produces
far lower carbon dioxide emissions

93
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:37,331
compared to a reusable cotton bag that
you need to use your cotton bags 7,100

94
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,680
times before it would have a lower impact
on the environment than the plastic

95
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,580
bag. We're left with a
complex process of tradeoffs.

96
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,900
Everything has an impact somehow and it's
hard to find the right balance between

97
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,610
the plastic also helps solve problems
that we don't have very good answers for

98
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,350
at the moment.
Globally.

99
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,280
One third of all food that's produced is
never Eason and ends up rotting away on

100
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:05,480
landfills where it produces me thing
and the best way of preventing food from

101
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:09,590
spoiling and avoiding unnecessary
waste is still plastic packaging.

102
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,640
It's also important to note where the
vast majority of the world's plastic

103
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,230
pollution is coming from.
Right now,

104
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,240
90% of all plastic waste to entering the
ocean through rivers comes from just a

105
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,040
10 rivers in Asia and Africa.

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,760
The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5
million tons of plastic into the ocean

107
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,760
each year. Countries like
China, India, Algeria,

108
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,200
or Indonesia industrialized as an
impressive pace in the last few decades

109
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,630
transforming the lives
of billions of people.

110
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,250
This development was so fast that the
garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't

111
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,130
keep up with collecting and
recycling all the new waste.

112
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,720
This broad if politicians in Europe
and the U s want to address this issue,

113
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,160
investing in infrastructure and developing
countries is just as important as

114
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:59,180
fighting plastic pollution at home with
campaigns and redesigning products to

115
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,440
minimize unnecessary plastic production.
The bottom line is,

116
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,040
as long as we don't address plastic
pollution from a global perspective,

117
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,780
we will not solve it. Plastic
pollution is a complicated problem.

118
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,670
We found a magic material and we
had a really good time with it,

119
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,680
but we need to be careful,

120
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,930
or just like midas will end up in
a world that we didn't wish for.

121
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,940
Your individual daily actions
still have a huge impact.

122
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,560
What you do matters.
Refused disposable plastics.

123
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,330
Convince your friends and family to
do the same pressure companies and

124
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,920
politicians to take the necessary steps
to keep our oceans clean and our food

125
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:46,490
safe.
Together we can beat plastic pollution.

126
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,290
This video was a collaboration with
UN environment and they're clean seas

127
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,400
campaign. If you want to take
action to turn the tide on plastics,

128
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,310
go to clean seas.org and make your pledge.

129
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,600
Okay.
