1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,600
What if you could use genetic engineering
to stop humanity's most dangerous

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,434
Predator,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,000
the deadliest animal on the planet
responsible for the death of billions,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,140
the mighty mosquito along
with other diseases.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,010
It plays host to malaria,
one of the cruelest parasites on earth,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,170
possibly the single biggest killer
of humans in history. In 2015 alone,

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,250
hundreds of millions were infected
and almost half a million people died.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,860
A new technology could help us
eradicate malaria forever, but to do so,

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,530
we need to engineer a
whole animal population.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,080
This is not a hypothetical problem.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,140
The modified mosquitoes
already exists in a lab.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,090
Should we use the technology and
is malaria bad enough to risk it?

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,280
Malaria is caused by a
group of microorganisms,

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,800
plasmodium very weird microorganisms
that consist of justice,

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,520
single cell, that parasites that
completely rely on mosquitoes.

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,870
Malaria always starts with an
insect bite and its salivary glands.

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,050
Thousands of sporozoites wait until the
insect penetrates your skin immediately

18
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:24,500
after invading you the head for the
liver where they quietly and to big cells

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,500
and hide from the immune
system for up to a month.

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,360
They stay here in stealth mode,

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,870
consuming the cells alive and
changing into their next form.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,040
Small drop like neuroscience.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,850
They multiply generating thousands of
themselves and then burst out of the cells

24
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,930
so thousands of parasites head into
the bloodstream to look for their next

25
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:48,030
victims,
red blood cells to stay unnoticed.

26
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,470
They wrap themselves in the
membranes of the cells they killed.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,270
Imagine that killing someone from the
inside and then taking their skin that has

28
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:57,770
camouflage brutal.

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,080
They now violently attack red blood
cells multiplying inside them until they

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,730
burst. Then finding more red blood cells
and this cycle repeats over and over.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,260
Pieces of dead cells spread lots of
toxic waste material which activates a

32
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,990
powerful immune response
causing flu like symptoms.

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,300
Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats
and chills, convulsions, headaches,

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,160
and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. If
malaria breaches the blood brain barrier,

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,520
it can cause coma,
neurological damage or death.

36
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,580
The parasites are ready for evacuation.

37
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:35,360
Now when another mosquito bites the
infected human, they get a ride.

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,100
The cycle can start over
in 2015 the Zika virus,

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,070
which causes horrible birth defects
if it infects pregnant women,

40
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,900
spread rapidly into new areas around the
globe. It too is carried by a mosquito.

41
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,650
The mosquito is the perfect
carrier for human diseases.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,500
They've been around for at
least 200 million years.

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,680
There are trillions of them and a
single one can they up to 300 at a time.

44
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,870
They are practically impossible to
eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi.

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,550
But today we have a new revolutionary
technology that could enable us to finally

46
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:14,350
win the war against them. Crispr
for the first time in human history,

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,470
we have the tools to make fast large
scale changes to entire species changing

48
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,600
their genetic information as we please.

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,590
So instead of attacking
isolated groups of insects,

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,220
why not just change the
types that transmit diseases?

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,290
Using genetic engineering?

52
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,610
Scientists successfully created a strain
of mosquitoes that are immune to the

53
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:41,020
malaria parasite by adding a new
antibody gene that specifically targets

54
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,920
plasmodium. These mosquitoes
will never spread malaria,

55
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,090
but just changing genetic
information is not enough.

56
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,650
The edits would only be inherited by half
the offspring because most jeans have

57
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:58,180
two versions inside the genome as a fail
safe. So after just two generations,

58
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,360
at most, only half of the offspring
would carry the engineer gene.

59
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,680
In a population of billions of mosquitoes,
they would hardly make a difference.

60
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,420
A genetic engineering method called
the gene drive solves this problem.

61
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,440
It forces the new gene to become
dominant in the following generations.

62
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,850
Overpowering the old gene almost
completely thanks to this twist.

63
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,090
99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes
offspring will carry the anti malaria

64
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,253
adis.

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,810
If we were to release enough engineered
mosquitoes into the wild to mate with no

66
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,430
mosquitoes, the malaria blocking
genes would spread extremely quickly.

67
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,480
As the new gene becomes a permanent
feature of the mosquito population,

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,520
plasmodium would lose its home base.

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,990
Scientists hope that the change would be
so fast that they could not adapt to it

70
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,290
quickly enough.
Malaria could virtually disappear.

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,100
If you take into account that maybe
half a million children are killed by it

72
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:54,340
every year. About five have
died since this video started.

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,170
Some scientists argue that we should use
the technology sooner rather than later.

74
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,980
The mosquitoes themselves would
probably only profit from this.

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,870
They don't have anything to gain from
carrying parasites and this might only be

76
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,750
the first step.
Malaria might just be the beginning.

77
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,910
Different mosquitoes also carried daggy
fever and Zika ticks transmit Lyme

78
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,170
disease. Flyers transmits sleeping
sickness, fleas transmit the plague.

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,210
We could save millions of
lives and prevent suffering
on an unbelievable scale.

80
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,380
So why haven't we done this yet?
For one,

81
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,660
CRISPR editing is batty four years old,

82
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,810
so until very recently we just couldn't
do it as fast and easily and there are

83
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,380
valid concerns.

84
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,520
Never before have humans consciously
change the genetic code of a free living

85
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:47,290
organism on this scale. Once we
do it, there is no going back,

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,261
so we're,

87
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:52,330
it has to be done right because there
could be unwanted consequences if we set

88
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,560
out to edit nature.

89
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,820
In the specific case of malaria though
the risk be acceptable since the genetic

90
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,840
modification doesn't make a big change
in the overall genome is only changes a

91
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,000
very specific part.

92
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,870
The worst case scenario here is probably
that it might not work or that the

93
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,760
parasite adapts in a negative way.

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,840
There is still much debate technology
as powerful as gene drive needs to be

95
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:22,070
handled with a lot of care, but at
some point we have to ask ourselves,

96
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,220
is it unethical to not use this technology
when every day 1000 children die?

97
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,060
Humanity has to decide how to act
on this in the next few years.

98
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,200
The public discussion is way behind
the technology. In this case,

99
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,640
what do you think

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,740
this video was made possible in
part by viewer donations on Patrion?

101
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,970
If you want to help us make more videos
like this and get nice rewards in return,

102
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,760
you can do so here.
We really appreciate it.

103
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,910
If you want to learn more about
the topic of genetic engineering,

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,580
we have another video
about CRISPR and Gmos,

105
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,240
and in case that's too much biology
for you. Here's a space pay list.
