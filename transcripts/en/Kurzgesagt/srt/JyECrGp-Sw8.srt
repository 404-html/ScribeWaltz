1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,390
Many of our viewers have asked
us a very serious question.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,500
What if we made a big pile of bottoms
and exploded every nuclear weapon in the

3
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,260
world all at once?
Strangely enough,

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,920
we couldn't find a good source to answer
this question to our satisfaction.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,870
So we gathered together a few scientists
to calculate what would happen and find

6
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,130
an answer to this extremely important
scientific problem once and for all.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,750
Currently there are 15,000
nuclear weapons on earth.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,310
The U S and Russia both have around 7,000
well, France, China, the UK, Pakistan,

9
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:37,850
India, Israel, and North Korea
earn around 1000 between them.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,090
But how much destructive power is this?
Really?

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,760
Let's try to put these
numbers into perspective.

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,190
On Earth,

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,190
there are about 4,500 cities or urban
areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Some are bigger than others,
so we'll assume that on average,

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,340
we need three nuclear bombs to
completely wipe out one city.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,900
This means we could destroy every single
city of Atlantis Earth without nuclear.

17
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,300
Our arsenal killing more
than 3 billion people,

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,640
roughly half of humanity in an instant,

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,300
and we'd still have 1,500
nuclear weapons left.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,150
Now that's what an expert
would call overkill.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,410
So we can say with confidence that we
have a lot of nuclear weapons and they can

22
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,460
do a lot of damage.

23
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,810
But what if we make a huge pilot level
15,000 bombs and pull the trigger?

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,250
Let's drop our nuclear pile in the middle
of the Amazon rain forest just to show

25
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:41,251
nature whose boss our warheads piled
haphazardly fits into a small warehouse.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,330
A typical us warhead has the
power of 200,000 tons of TNT.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,660
So 15,000 warheads would be the equivalent
of 3 billion tons of TNT for scale.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,260
This is enough to rebuild the whole island
of Manhattan with every building and

29
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,680
skyscraper using stacks of TNT.

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,070
The closest thing we can compare to
the energy gathered here is a volcano.

31
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,930
One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions
in recorded history took place in 1883

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,370
on the island of Krakatoa.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,740
Eruption was so powerful that 70% of the
island and the surrounding archipelago

34
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,350
was destroyed.
Killing tens of thousands of people.

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,190
It's affects were felt around the
world for days after the event.

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,710
Our nuclear pile contains 15 times the
energy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruption.

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,450
So let's find me.

38
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:33,451
Push the button three to one in a second.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,320
A fireball,

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,760
50 kilometers across it
vaporizes everything in its
way and creates a blast wave

41
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:42,520
that flattens 3000 square
kilometers of forest.

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,900
Every living thing within 250
kilometers will start to burden.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,160
The explosion will be heard literally
around the world as the pressure wave

44
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,100
circles the earth tens of
times over the next few weeks,

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,630
millions of tons of incinerated material
art catapulted into the atmosphere.

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,260
The mushroom cloud reaches the
outer reaches of the stratosphere,

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,190
pushing up against space itself.
After things have calmed down,

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,240
a small crater about 10 kilometers across
his left in the center of the worst

49
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,930
wildfires the planets has
seen in millennia spreading
throughout South America,

50
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,210
burning down forests and cities alike,

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,640
and now the unpleasant part begins
extremely radioactive material will kill

52
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,000
living things very quickly and a
large area, several kilometers around.

53
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,640
The crater is now uninhabitable,
as is everywhere.

54
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,440
For hundreds of kilometers downwind.

55
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,880
Much of the fallout is carrot high into
the atmosphere by the mushroom cloud and

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,170
carried around the planet.

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,730
The amount of radioactive material
in the environment doubles worldwide,

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,110
which still isn't civilization ending,
but we may see more cancer for a while.

59
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,220
A portion of the particles will flow to
the edge of space for years and cause a

60
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,600
nuclear winter that could lower global
temperatures by a few degrees for a few

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,940
years.
This explosion was pretty bad.

62
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,490
If you're in South America
and especially Brazil,

63
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,390
the Amazon rain forest is pretty
much history, which is not great,

64
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,600
but human life will go on.
Okay,

65
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,090
but what if we expose
more nuclear weapons?

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,100
Let's suppose humanity decided to mine
every bit of uranium on earth and build

67
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,760
as many nuclear bombs as possible.
At current usage,

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,530
it's estimated that there are around 35
million tons of uranium in Earth's crust,

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
enough to power human civilization for
over 2000 years or to build millions of

70
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,390
new peer warheads.
For the sake of argument.

71
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,900
Let's say we create a pile with the
yield of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs,

72
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,950
which makes up a cube three kilometers
high that contains at roughly the energy

73
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,360
of the asteroid impacts that ended the
age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,750
except it's also nuclear three two one.

75
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,940
How pile explodes in a fireball
stretching so high into the sky that it's

76
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:56,320
visible from half of South America
with so much power that the ground just

77
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:01,321
splashes like water forming a crater 100
kilometers across bedrock on the scale

78
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,660
of Horn mountain ranges is
vaporized in an instance,

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,710
while thousands of tons of material is
catapulted away with such speed that it's

80
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,770
injected into space,
some leaves out forever.

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,880
While most fair comes raining down as
hot burning debris that heats up the

82
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,830
atmosphere to oven lake temperatures,

83
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,700
killing most big animals and causing
firestorms all over the world.

84
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,230
The Earth's crust rings like a
bell struck by global earthquakes.

85
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:30,310
It stronger than anything in recorded
history decimating cities around the world

86
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,210
while hurricane force winds,
plaza,

87
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,220
every single tree and South America
and wildfires consume the continents.

88
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,470
The abundance of hydrocarbons in the
Amazon burn to form ash are cast into the

89
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:45,190
atmosphere dotting the sky and keeping
sunlight from reaching the surface,

90
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,830
dropping temperatures to
near freezing worldwide.

91
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,960
The ensuing global winter may last for
decades and results in the extinction of

92
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,750
every large animal species
Schumer is included.

93
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,110
We could also mention that every
corner of the planet is covered with a

94
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:02,810
radioactive fallout, but at this point
it doesn't matter that much anymore.

95
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,320
This is humanities extinction event.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
The astronauts aboard the International
Space Station get to enjoy a great view

97
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,330
for a while,

98
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,140
but it's not unlikely that the spray of
rocks blast into always will destroy the

99
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,974
station.

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,700
Those lucky enough to be in bunkers
or in submarines deep below the ocean

101
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:23,750
surface may survive the longest before
they exhaust their food supplies and have

102
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,490
to venture out for mall.
They'll find the world a charred,

103
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,810
freezing radioactive wasteland.

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,520
The planet itself doesn't care at all.
After just a few million years,

105
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,790
the wounds of the explosions
have healed and life is thriving,

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,670
arguably even more so than
when humans are around.

107
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,310
If intelligent life emerges again,

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,180
it might be able to work out what
happened when they studied geology.

109
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,530
They'll find a bizarre and very thin
layer of rock covering the entire world,

110
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,430
enriched in radioactive elements like
uranium and the other nasty things it

111
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,300
decays who mixed with rare earth
metals and plastics that humans used.

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,990
They would probably be very,
very confused.

113
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,340
Videos like this one take well over
1200 hours to finish. Over the years,

114
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,000
we put more and more effort into research,
conversations with experts,

115
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,980
illustration and animation, sound designer
and fact checking. For this video,

116
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,800
we put a lot of extra work
into our sources document.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,410
You can read how we got to
the information in the video.

118
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,710
What are experts thought about is
where they disagreed with each other.

119
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,390
We can take the time to do this
because of you, our viewers,

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,200
because you watch and share our videos
by our posters and supporters on picture
