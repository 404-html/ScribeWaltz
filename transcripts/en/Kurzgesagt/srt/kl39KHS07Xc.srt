1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,770
What if the state covered your cost
of living? Would you still go to work,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,750
go back to school, not work
at all? What would you do?

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,770
This concept is called a universal basic
income or ubi and it's nothing less

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:20,841
than the most ambitious social policy
of our times and 2017 basic income is

5
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,670
gaining momentum around the world.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,250
First trials are ongoing or on their way
and the growing number of countries are

7
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:32,310
considering ubi as an
alternative to welfare.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,600
How would it work and what are the key
arguments for and against right now

9
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:42,960
people can't radiate, agree what
universal basic income is or should be.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,040
Some want to use it to eliminate
welfare and cup bureaucracy.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,440
Others wanted as a free extra for
existing programs or even want it to be so

12
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,880
high. That work itself becomes
optional. For this video,

13
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,640
we'll talk mostly about
the minimum basic income,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
enough money to be above the poverty
line in the u s this means about $1,000 a

15
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,080
month or $12,000 a year.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,040
The money would not be taxed and you
can do whatever you wanted with this and

17
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,064
this scenario,

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,570
ubi is aware of transferring the wealth
of a society while still keeping the

19
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:22,980
free market and tax,
but if we hand out free money,

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,280
will people just spend it on
booze and stopped working.

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,210
A 2013 study by the World
Bank specifically examined
if poor people waste their

22
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,420
handouts on tobacco and alcohol if
they receive it in the form of cash,

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,710
the clear answer, no they
don't. The opposite is true.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,620
Other studies have shown
that the richer you are,

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,860
the more drugs and alcohol you can see
in the laziest drunk poor person is a

26
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:53,460
stereotype rather than reality.
What about laziness?

27
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,100
Universal basic income test runs done in
Canada in the 1970s showed that around

28
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:03,360
1% of the recipients and stopped working
mostly to take care of their kids.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,890
On average,

30
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,890
people reduce their working hours by
less than 10% the extra time was used to

31
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:13,770
achieve goals like going back to
school or looking for better jobs,

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,850
but if laziness and drugs
are not a huge deal,

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,860
why doesn't our current welfare
state solve poverty? Welfare,

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,940
or unemployment programs often come
with a lot of strings attached. Mike,

35
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,130
taking part in courses,

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
applying to a certain number of jobs a
month or accepting any kind of job offer,

37
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,010
no matter if there's a good fit or what's
it pays besides the loss of personal

38
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,610
freedom,

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,570
these conditions are often a huge waste
of time and only serve to make the

40
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,120
unemployment.
Statistics seem less bat.

41
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,170
Often your time would be much better
spent looking for the right job,

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,650
continuing education,
or starting a business.

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,840
Another unwanted side effect of many
welfare programs is that they trap people

44
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,130
in poverty and passive behavior.

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,290
Imagine a benefit of $1,000
each month in a lot of programs.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,190
If you earn a single dollar extra,
the whole thing is taken away.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,410
If you take a job that's paying $1,200
you might not only lose your benefits,

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,890
but because of your taxes and other costs,
link transportation,

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,320
you might end up having
less money than before.

50
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,420
So if you actively trying to better your
situation and your total income is not

51
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:30,160
improving or even a shrinking welfare
can create a ceiling that traps people in

52
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,870
poverty and rewards.

53
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:36,871
Passive behavior of basic income can never
be caught and therefore getting a job

54
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,530
and additional income will always
make your financial situation better.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,640
Work is always rewarded
instead of a ceiling.

56
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,090
It creates a floor from which
people can lift themselves up.

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,580
But even if you bi is the better model,
is it economically feasible?

58
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,440
What about inflation?

59
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,820
Won't prices just rise making
everything just like it was before?

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,140
Since the money is not being
created by magic or printers,

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,360
it needs to be transferred from somewhere.

62
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,350
It's more of a shift of funds
than the creation of new ones.

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,210
Hence no inflation. Okay,
but how do we pay for it?

64
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,290
There's no right answer here
because the world is too diverse.

65
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,210
How well off a country is.

66
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,450
What the local values are are things
like high taxes or cutting the defense

67
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,710
budget politically acceptable or not?

68
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,540
How much welfare state is already
in place and is it defective?

69
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,130
Each country has its own
individual path to a ubi.

70
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,060
The easiest way to pay for a ubi is to
end all welfare and use the free funds to

71
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,840
finance us. Not only with this make a
number of government agencies disappear,

72
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,160
which in itself saves money. It would
also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy.

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,960
On the other hand, cutting them could
leave many people worse off than before.

74
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,320
If the goal is to have a
foundation for everybody,

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,370
there still needs to be programs of
some sort because just like countries,

76
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,440
people are not the same.
The second way higher taxes,

77
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,190
especially for the very
wealthy in the u s for example,

78
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,870
there's been a lot of economic growth,

79
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,170
but most of the benefits from it
have gone to the richest few percent.

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,780
The wealth gap is rapidly widening and
many argue that it might be time to

81
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:29,650
distribute. The spoiler was more
evenly to preserve the social piece.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,080
There could be taxes on financial
transactions, capital land value,

83
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,090
carbon or even robots,

84
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,880
but ubi is not necessarily expensive.
According to a recent study,

85
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,120
a ubi of $1,000 per month in the u s
could actually grow the GDP by 12% over

86
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:54,070
eight years because it would enable
poor people to spend more and increase

87
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,700
overall demand.
What of the people who do the dirty work,

88
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,260
who will work in the fields,
crawl through sewers all if pianos,

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,640
if you don't need to, for survival?
Will people still do hard,

90
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,170
boring and unfulfilling?

91
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:14,150
Labor Ubi might give them enough
leverage to demand better pay and working

92
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,984
conditions.

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,580
The study calculated that every extra
dollar going to wage earners would add

94
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,190
about $1 21 to the national economy.

95
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,380
While every extra dollar going to high
income Americans would add only 39 cents.

96
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,090
There would still be very rich and poor
people, but we could eliminate fear,

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,980
suffering and existential panic for
a significant part of the population.

98
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,590
Making poor citizens better off
could be a smart economic tactic.

99
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,500
For some,
this isn't enough.

100
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,640
They want a ubi large enough to
live a middle class existence.

101
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,490
If we set the financial obstacle aside,

102
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,690
this idea fundamentally challenges
how our society is constructed.

103
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,010
By owning money, you earn the
possibility to take part in society.

104
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,220
There's determines your
status and options,

105
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,990
but it also forces many
people into spending huge
chunks of their time on things

106
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:10,040
they don't care about.

107
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,160
In 2016 only 33% of US
employees were engaged at work.

108
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
16% were actively miserable
and the remaining 51% we're
only physically present.

109
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,110
Would 67% of people stop working?
If they could?

110
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,430
It would be unfair to
portray workers just a chore.

111
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,850
Work gives us something to do.
It challenges us.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,330
It motivates us to improve
and forces us to engage.

113
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,400
Many find friends or partners at work.
We work for social status,

114
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,530
wealth and optics in the world.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,780
We're looking for something to do with
our lives and for many people work gives

116
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:54,650
them meaning.
There are other concerns with ubi.

117
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,520
If all welfare programs or
exchanged for one single payment,

118
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,920
this gives the government
a lot of leverage.

119
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Individual programs are easier to attack
or cart than a multitude or populists

120
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,510
might promise drastic changes
to the ubi to get into power.

121
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,760
And a universal basic income doesn't
tackle all problems when it comes to

122
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,550
quality rents.
For example,

123
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,460
while $1,000 might be
great in the countryside,

124
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,340
it's not a lot for expensive
metropolitan areas,

125
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,250
which could lead to poor
people moving outwards.

126
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,730
And the difference between rich and
poor becoming even more extreme.

127
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,520
And of course for some people,

128
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,290
the concept of work itself not being
essential for survival is appalling.

129
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,010
So as the universal
basic income a good idea,

130
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,040
the honest answer is
that we don't know yet.

131
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,510
There needs to be a lot more research,
more and bigger test drugs.

132
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,530
We need to think about what kind of ubi
we want and what we're prepared to give

133
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,740
up to pay for it.
The potential is huge.

134
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,610
It might be the most promising model
to sustainably eliminate poverty.

135
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,280
It might seriously reduced the amount
of desperation in the world and make us

136
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,410
all much less stressed out.

137
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,440
This video was made possible by a
universal basic income provided by you.
