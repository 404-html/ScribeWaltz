1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,530
Metta as we know it,
atoms, stars and galaxies,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,890
planets and trees,
rocks and us.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,450
This matter accounts for less
than 5% of the known universe,

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,870
about 25% is dark matter
and 70% dark energy,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,400
both of which are invisible.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,440
This is kind of strange because it
suggests that everything we experience is

7
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:29,820
really only a tiny fraction of reality,
but it gets worse.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,530
We really have no clue what dark
matter and energy are or how they work.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,090
We are pretty sure they exist though.
So what do we know?

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,450
Dark matter is the stuff that
makes it possible for Gannett

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,340
says to exist. When we calculated why
the universe is structured the way it is,

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,060
it quickly became clear that there's
just not enough normal matter.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,650
The gravity of the visible matter is
not strong enough to form galaxies and

14
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,820
complex structures.

15
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,170
The stars would more likely be scattered
all over the place and not form

16
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:12,790
galaxies. So we know there is
something else inside and around them.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,040
Something that doesn't emit or
reflects light, something dark.

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,390
But besides being able to calculate
the existence of dark matter,

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,720
we can see it kind of places with a high
concentration of dark matter bend light

20
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:32,980
passing nearby so we know
there's something there
that interacts with gravity.

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,310
Right now we have more ideas about what
dark energy is not than what it is we

22
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:44,350
know dark matter is not just clouds of
normal matter without stars because it

23
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,360
would have met particles we could detect.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,700
Dark matter is not anti matter because
anti-matter produces unique gamma rays

25
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,380
when it reacts with normal matter.

26
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,190
Dark matter is also not
made up of black holes,

27
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,940
very compact objects that vine
the effect their surroundings.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,810
While dark matter seems to be
scattered all over the place.

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,620
Basically we only know
three things for sure. One,

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,820
something is out there too.
It interacts with gravity.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,590
Three varies.

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,650
A lot of it dark matter is probably
made up of a complicated exotic particle

33
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,560
that doesn't interact with light
and matter in a way we expect,

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,630
but right now we just don't know.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,970
Dark energy is even more strange
and mysterious. We can't detect it.

36
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,700
We can't measure it and we can't taste it,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,790
but we do see its effects very clearly.

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,270
In 1929 Edwin Hubble examined how the
wavelength of light emitted by distant

39
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:46,810
galaxies shifts towards the red end
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,140
As it travels through space,
he found that fainter,

41
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,200
more distant galaxies showed
a large degree of red shift.

42
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,540
Closer galaxies,

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,730
not so much Hubble determined that
this was because universe itself is

44
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,564
expanding.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,490
The red shift occurs because the wave
lengths of light are stretched as the

46
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,810
universe expands.

47
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,980
More recent discoveries have shown
that the expansion of the universe is

48
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,900
accelerating.
Before that,

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,500
it was thought that the pull of gravity
would cause the expansion to either slow

50
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,340
down or even retract and collapse
in on itself. At some point,

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,940
space doesn't change its
properties as it expands.

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,890
There's just more of this new space
is constantly created everywhere.

53
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,870
Galaxies are tight bound clusters
of stuff held together by gravity,

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,140
so we don't experience this
expansion in our daily lives,

55
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,150
but we see it everywhere around us.

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,010
Wherever there is empty space in the
universe, more is forming every second.

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,340
So dark energy seems to be some kind of
energy intrinsic to empty space and a g

58
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,640
that is stronger than anything else we
know and the keeps getting stronger as

59
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:59,641
time passes by empty space has more energy
than everything else in the universe

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,624
combined.

61
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,920
We have multiple ideas about
what dark energy might be.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,730
One idea is that dark
energy is not a thing,

63
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,930
but just a property of space.
Empty space is not nothing.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,340
It has its own energy. It can generate
more space and is quite active,

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,680
so as the universe expands,

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,420
it could be that just more and more
space appears to fill the gaps and this

67
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,210
leads to a faster expanding universe.

68
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,870
This idea is close to an
idea that Einstein had back
in 1917 of a concept of a

69
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:38,320
cosmological constant or force that
counteracted the force of gravity.

70
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,610
The only problem is that when we try
to calculate the amount of this energy,

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,230
the result was so wrong and with
that it only added to the confusion.

72
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,450
Another idea is that empty
space is actually full of
temporary virtual particles

73
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,460
that spontaneously and continually formed
from nothing and then disappear into

74
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,294
nothing.
Again,

75
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,570
the energy from those particles could
be dark energy or maybe dark Kenji is an

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,710
unknown kind of dynamic energy fluid
or field which permeates the entire

77
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,180
universe but somehow has the opposite
effect on the universe than normal energy

78
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:15,160
and matter.
But if it exists,

79
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,670
we don't know how and where
or how we could detect it.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,030
So there are still a lot
of questions to answer.

81
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,010
Our theories about dark matter and dark
energy are still just that theories.

82
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,120
On the one hand, this is kind of
frustrating. On the other hand,

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,060
this is frontier science
making it very exciting.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,480
It shows us that no matter how much
we feel we're on top of things,

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,190
we're still very much apes
with smartphones on a tiny
fragile island in space

86
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,670
looking into the sky,
wondering how our universe works.

87
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,680
There is so much left to
learn and that is awesome.
