1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,260
Neutron stars are one of the most
extreme things in the universe.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,530
They're like giant Hassam
cause kilometers in diameter.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,140
Unbelievably dense and violent,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,320
but how can something
like this even exist?

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,970
The life of a star is dominated by two
forces being in balance its own gravity

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,410
and the radiation pressure of it's
fusion reaction. In the core of stars,

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,720
hydrogen is fused into helium.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,350
Eventually the hydrogen and the core is
exhausted. If the star is massive enough,

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,720
helium is now fused into carbon.

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,030
The cause of these massive stars become
layered like onions as heavier and

11
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:50,740
heavier atomic nuclei build up at the
center. Carbon is fused into neon,

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,290
which leads to oxygen,
which leads to silicon.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,630
Eventually the fusion reaction hits iron,
which cannot fuse into another element.

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,680
When the fusion stumps,
the radiation pressure drops rapidly.

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,310
The star is no longer in balance and if
it's core mass exceeds about 1.4 so the

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,590
masses,
a catastrophic collapse takes place.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,660
The outer part of the core reaches
velocities of up to 70,000 kilometers a

18
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:21,190
second as it collapses towards
the center of the star. Now. Oh,

19
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:25,810
neither fundamental forces inside an
atom are left to fight the gravitational

20
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:26,644
collapse.

21
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,690
The quantum mechanical repulsion of
electrons is overcome and electrons and

22
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:36,160
protons fuse into neutrons packed
as densely as an atomic nucleus.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,880
The outer layers of the star
are catapulted into space
in a violence supernova

24
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:45,580
explosion,
so now we have a neutron star.

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,430
It's masses between one and three sons,

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,640
but compressed to an object about 25
kilometers wide and 500,000 times the mass

27
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:00,550
of earth in this tiny ball that's
roughly the diameter of Manhattan.

28
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,270
It's so dense that one cubic centimeter
of neutron star contains the same mass

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,450
as an iron cube,
700 meters across.

30
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,360
That's roughly 1 billion tons.

31
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,920
As massive as Mount Everest in a
space the size of a sugar cube,

32
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,430
neutron star gravity is
pretty impressive too.

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,210
If you were to drop an object
from one meter over the surface,

34
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,420
it would hit the star in one microsecond
and accelerate up to 7.2 million

35
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:31,870
kilometers per hour.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
The surface is super flat
with irregularities of five
millimeters maximum with a

37
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:39,700
super thin atmosphere of hot plasma.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,450
The surface temperature is about 1 million
Kelvin compared to 5,800 Kelvin for

39
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,960
our son.
Let's look inside the neutron star.

40
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,790
The Christ is extremely hard and is
most likely made of an iron atom nuclei

41
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,250
lattice with a sea of
electrons flowing through them.

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,530
The closer we get to the the more
neutrons and fewer protons we see until

43
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,280
there's just an incredibly dense
soup of indistinguishable neutrons.

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,210
The cause of neutron stars are very,
very wait.

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,790
We're not sure what their properties are,

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,820
but how closest guess is superfluid
neutron degenerate matter or some kind of

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,240
ultra dense quark matter
called quark glue on plasma.

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,770
That doesn't make any sense
in the traditional way and
can only exist in such an

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,190
ultra extreme environment.
In many ways,

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,100
a neutron star is similar
to a giant atom core.

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,610
The most important
difference is that Adam,

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
cause I held together by
strong interaction and
neutron stars by gravity as if

53
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,680
all this wasn't extreme enough. Let's
take a look at a few other properties.

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,840
Neutron stars spend very,

55
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,260
very fast young ones
several times per second,

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,530
and if there's a poor star
nearby to feed the neutron star,

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,290
it can rotate up to several
hundred times per second,

58
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,580
like the object Psr j one
seven four eight two four four,

59
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:05,581
six and it's bins at approximately
252 million kilometers per hour.

60
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,080
This is so fast that the star
has a rather strange shape.

61
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,850
We call these objects pulse house
because they emit a strong radio signal,

62
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,560
and the magnetic field of a neutron star
is roughly a trillion times stronger

63
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,240
than the magnetic field of earth.

64
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,280
So strong that atoms get bent when
they enter it's influence. Okay.

65
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,750
I think we got the point across.
Neutron stars are so the most extreme,

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,080
but also some of the coolest
objects in the universe.

67
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Hopefully we'll one day sends patients
to learn more about them and take some

68
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,670
neat pictures,
but we shouldn't get too close.
