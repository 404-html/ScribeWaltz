1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,470
Are you alone in the universe or
are you connected to anything?

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,670
First of all, you're part of a group
of mammals that's still very young,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,320
but we can make youtube videos already
and build large Hadron collider as we've

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,840
also split the atom and invented Pokemon.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,860
We stem from an ancient life form that
began living about three and a half

6
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:23,340
billion years ago. We feel like
we're in control of this planet,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,200
but we aren't rarely one little
asteroid or one creative virus is ready.

8
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,640
All it would take to kill us off for
good humanity credits itself with being

9
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,150
able to destroy the planet,
but even with all our nuclear toys,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,600
we would probably be just cause
a huge mass extinction of best.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,730
Maybe we could kill 90% of everything
living on this Panisse big deal.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,600
A few million years later,
life would be back everywhere.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,580
Most of microscopic life and life below
the surface wouldn't even be disturbed

14
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,790
that much.
Probably on a geological time scale.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,950
Our impact on earth is kind of laughable.
We're actually not that powerful.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,600
We live on this tiny wet rock that speeds
through space following a massive ball

17
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,550
of burning plasma.
One day,

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,140
this ball of plasma will stop burning
and most likely kill us in the process.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,280
If we survive the death of the
son and colonize the galaxy,

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,270
theoretically we could survive until
the last star in the universe goes out.

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,230
After that life becomes pretty impossible.
Okay,

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,670
so everything has an end. Where does
this leave you as an individual?

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,690
At one point in your life,
for about half an hour,

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,840
you were only one single cell
inside your mother's womb.

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,250
The creature just not 0.1
millimeters in diameter. Today,

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,450
you consist of about 50 trillion cells,
50 trillion,

27
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:55,830
incredibly complex little biological
machines that are much bigger and more

28
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,660
complex than the average bacteria.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,070
They operate by the laws of physics
and chemistry and use micro machines to

30
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,760
build proteins, make ng usable,
devour foods, transport resources,

31
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:09,990
transmit information or reproduce.
They communicate, duplicate,

32
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,300
commit suicide,
fight off intruders,

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,560
and fulfill super specialized duties for
the greater good of keeping you alive.

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,520
So you can have babies,
but where is the you part in this?

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,890
If you're made of
trillions of little things,

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,410
but basic information for you is stored
in the DNA and molecule that encodes the

37
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:32,100
genetic instructions used
in the development and
functioning of all known living

38
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:35,790
things. If you were to unravel
it, it will be two meters long.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,930
If you combined all the digital
DNA strings in order ourselves,

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,950
you'd get a string so long that it would
stretch to Pluto and back to Earth.

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,430
That's pretty long and your DNA is a
direct connection to your very first

42
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:55,740
ancestor. Take a second to think about
this. In every cell of your body,

43
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,370
there's a little string of stuff that's
been there in various forms for 3.4

44
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,640
billion years. It evolved, it mutated,

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,070
it duplicated trillions of times,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,060
but it directly connects you to the
first living being on this planet.

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,760
We could say you touch to every living
being that came before you with your Dna,

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,180
but you are more than your DNA.

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,870
Your body is made of
seven octillion Adams.

50
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,630
That's 7 billion billion,
billion.

51
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,200
Roughly 93% of the mass of the human
body is made up of just three elements.

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,840
Oxygen,
carbon and hydrogen.

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,890
Oxygen and hydrogen are
predominantly found in water,

54
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,860
which makes up about 60%
of the body by weight.

55
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,010
Carbon is maybe the most
important element for life.

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,360
It can easily bond with other atoms
which allows for the building of long,

57
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,750
complex chains of molecules which
make up the solid part of you.

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,010
The remaining 7% is a tour of
the periodic table of elements,

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,880
nitrogen, calcium, phosphorous,
potassium, sulfur, sodium chloride,

60
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:05,020
magnesium ion fluoride, zinc, copper,
iodine, selenium, chromium, manganese,

61
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,300
molybdenum, cobalt, lithium,
strontium element, Niamh,

62
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,070
silicon led vanadium asked Nick and Roman.
By the way,

63
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,160
there's also means you're
about not 0.5% metal.

64
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,490
No Matter Watch your favorite music has.
Anyway.

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,210
These elements perform various functions
like enabling oxygen transport,

66
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,120
building of bones and cell structures,
carrying signals,

67
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,250
driving chemical reactions,
and a lot more.

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,850
Your body is in a constant
state of transition.

69
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,920
Every 16 days,

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,160
75% of you has been replaced because a
healthy human exchanges about 100% of

71
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,220
that water in that time period.
Each year.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,400
About 98% of your atoms are replaced by
new ones and every five years close to

73
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,240
all of the atoms that make up your
body weren't there five years ago,

74
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,260
so you could call yourself a
temporary collection of atoms,

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,270
but where did these atoms come from?
In the beginning of the universe,

76
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,820
they were mostly hydrogen
and helium atoms.

77
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,330
Enormous gas clouds formed over millennia
and grew denser and denser until they

78
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:14,170
collapsed under their own gravity giving
birth to the first das in the cause of

79
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:18,700
these stars, hydrogen was converted
into helium under extreme conditions.

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,440
After millions of years,

81
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,650
the hydrogen became exhausted and the
stars began dying under super extreme

82
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:26,800
conditions.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,090
All elements we know today were created
a fraction of a second before they died

84
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,490
and exploded in supernovas.

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,930
They shop most of their contents into
space while the cause collapsed and became

86
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,764
black holes.

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
All these elements traveled through
space for who knows how long until they

88
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,750
arrived at a different cloud that was
slowly forming a new star, our sun.

89
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,610
These elements that once with the insides
of a star formed planets and found

90
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,670
their way onto earth where
they enabled life to begin.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,450
So we are directly connected to the
first stars ever born in the universe.

92
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,980
We are heart of the universe.
The idea with being deeply connected,

93
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,670
minuscule part of an enormous structure,
it's really mind blowing.

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,590
We don't know what all this means
or if it means anything at all.

95
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,810
We know that we're made of little bars,

96
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,040
the connectors to everything in the
universe to the beginning of everything.

97
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,980
And this is kind of a nice thought.
You are not alone. You never were.

98
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,700
You never will be.
