1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,280
Is the connection between us
and the universe. Through light,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,420
we can experience distant stars and
look back at the beginning of existence

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,610
itself,
but what is light

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,410
in a nutshell is the smallest quantity
of energy that can be transported a Futon

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,990
and elementary particle
without a real size.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,080
The combi split Oh me created or
destroyed light also has a wave particle

7
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,780
duality being kind of a particle
and a wave at the same time,

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,770
although this is a lie, so when we say
night, we actually mean visible light,

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,640
which is a tiny part of the
electromagnetic spectrum energy in form of

10
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,110
electromagnetic radiation.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,670
Electromagnetic radiation consists of
an enormous range of wavelengths and

12
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,504
frequencies.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,720
Gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths
because they're the highest energy

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,470
photons, but most gamma rays
are just under 10 pick a meters,

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,070
which is still way smaller than
a hydrogen atom. For reference,

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
a hydrogen atom compared to a scent is
about as big as a scent compared to the

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,220
moon. Visible light is in the middle of
the spectrum in the range of about 400

18
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,760
nanometers to 700 enemies.
It's about the size of bacteria.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,950
On the other end of the spectrum,

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,160
radio waves can be up to
100 kilometers in diameter.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,600
While the biggest wave lengths we know
exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to

22
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,520
a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger
than earth. From a physics standpoint,

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,470
all these different waves are the same.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,950
They all have the wave particle
duality and travel at sea.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,420
The speed of light just at different
frequencies. So what makes it visible?

26
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:42,570
Lights especial special then?
Well, absolutely nothing.

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,950
We just happened to have evolved eyes
that are good at registering exactly this

28
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,930
part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,960
This is not a complete coincidence though.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,450
Visible light is the only
set of electromagnetic
radiation that propagates wet

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,060
in water,

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,080
which happens to be where most eyes
first evolved millions of years ago.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,070
That was a smart move because light
not only interacts with matter,

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,060
it's also altered by it and can be used
to gather information about the world

35
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,890
around us with almost no delay,

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,060
which is arguably really
helpful for survival. Okay.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,710
Where does light come from? A vast range
of electromagnetic waves are created.

38
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,670
When atoms or molecules drop from a
higher state of energy to a lower one,

39
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,470
they lose energy and a message in the form
of radiation at the microscopic level,

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,910
visible lines is created when an electron
within anatomy that is in an excited

41
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:37,050
state, drugs to a lower energy state
and losers. This excess energy,

42
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,250
the same way incoming light can activate
an electron to a higher state of energy

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,190
by being absorbed by it.
Macroscopically.

44
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,030
The moving charge of the electron
creates an oscillating magnet field which

45
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,000
creates an oscillating electric
field perpendicular to it.

46
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,670
These two fields move
themselves through space,

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,130
transferring energy from
one place to another,

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,910
carrying information about its place of
creation with why of all the things in

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:05,140
the universe is light. The fastest thing
there is, let's change the question.

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,260
What is the fastest way to
travel to space in the universe?

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,530
It's see exactly 299 million,

52
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,360
792,458 meters per second in a vacuum.

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,640
1 billion kilometers per hour.

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,690
Electromagnetic radiation just
happens to move this fast.

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,520
Any particle that has no massive travels
at sea without acceleration or any in

56
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,240
between.

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,930
The light that's being released from a
candle does not speed up until it reaches

58
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,920
lightspeed at the very instant of
its creation. It speed is. See,

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,330
so why is c or the speed
of light finite then? Well,

60
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,420
nobody knows. Oh, universities
just built this way.

61
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,070
We don't have a smart answer here.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,840
So light is a part of a spectrum and
elementary particle that also behaves like

63
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,280
a wave propelled by two perpendicular
fields traveling at the speed limit of the

64
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,510
universe. Okay, that's nice and all.

65
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,740
But what about all the crazy stuff about
traveling at the speed of light and

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,130
time, the twin paradox contem
stuff and things like that.

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,300
We have to save them for another
video. For now, let's just be happy.

68
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,720
There'll be evolved eyes that pickup
waves of information permeating the

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,310
universe, making a c things that help us
to put our existence into perspective.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,670
Okay.
