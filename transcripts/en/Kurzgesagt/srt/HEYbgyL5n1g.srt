1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,210
Three reasons why we should
stop using nuclear energy.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,610
One nuclear weapons proliferation nuclear
technology made a violent entrance

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,650
onto the world stage just one year after
the world's first ever nuclear test

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:18,651
explosion in 1944 to large cities were
destroyed by just two single bombs after

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,460
that, react to technology slowly evolved
as a means of generating electricity,

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,210
but it's always been intimately connected
with nuclear weapons technology.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,710
It's nearly impossible to develop nuclear
weapons without access to react to

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,240
technology.
In fact,

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,110
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty serves
the purpose of spreading the nuclear

10
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:41,250
reactor technology without spreading
nuclear weapons with limited success.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,720
In 40 years.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,110
Five countries have developed their
own weapons with the help of react to

13
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,944
technology.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,090
The fact of the matter is that it can
be very hard to distinguish a covert

15
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:54,510
nuclear weapons program from the
peaceful use of nuclear energy.

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,000
In the 1970s the big nuclear powers were
happily selling peaceful technology to

17
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,150
smaller countries,
which then developed weapons of their own.

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,810
The road to deadly nuclear weapons is
always paved with peaceful reactors to

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,810
nuclear waste and pollution.
Spent.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Nuclear fuel is not only radioactive
but also contains extremely poisonous

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,500
chemical elements and like plutonium,

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,540
it loses its harmfulness only slowly
over several tens of thousands of years.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
And there is also a process
called reprocessing,

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,410
which means the extraction of
plutonium from spent nuclear fuel.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,180
It can be used for two purposes to build
nuclear weapons or to use it as new

26
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:36,780
fuel,

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,590
but hardly any of it is used as fuel
because we don't have the right kind of

28
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,260
reactors for that.
A milligram will kill you.

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,610
A few kilograms make an atomic bomb
and even an inconspicuous country like

30
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:52,170
Germany literally has tons of the staff
just lying around because reprocessing

31
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:56,940
sounded like a good idea decades ago
and where we'll all the waste go after

32
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:00,150
dumping it into the ocean was forbidden.
We've tried to bury it,

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,090
but we can't find a place where
it will definitely stay secure.

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,680
For tens of thousands of years,

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,190
over 30 countries have
rate nearly 400 reactors,

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,140
managing several hundred thousands of
tons of nuclear waste and only one is

37
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:18,120
currently serious about
opening a permanent civilian
way storage, tiny Finland,

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,790
three accidents and disasters.
Over 60 years of nuclear power.

39
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,200
You said there have been
seven major accidents in
reactors or facilities dealing

40
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:31,560
with nuclear waste.
Three of those were mostly contained,

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,400
but four of them released significant
amounts of radioactivity into the

42
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,234
environment.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
In 1957 1987 and 2011 large
areas of land in Russia,

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,680
Ukraine, and Japan were rendered unfit
for human habitation for decades to come.

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,540
The number of deaths is highly disputed,
but probably lies in the thousands.

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,070
These disasters happened with nuclear
reactors are very different types in very

47
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,160
different countries and several
decades apart. Looking at the numbers,

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,170
we may as well ask ourselves,
oh,

49
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:06,370
10% of the world's energy supply
worth a devastating disaster.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,020
Every 30 years worth 30% be worth
another Fukushima or Chernobyl,

51
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,640
somewhere on earth every 10 years.
What area would have to be contaminated?

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,150
So we say no more.
Where is the line?

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,360
So should we use nuclear energy?

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,070
The risks may outweigh the benefits and
maybe we should stop looking into this

55
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:31,380
direction and drop this technology for
good. If you want to hear the other side,

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,510
