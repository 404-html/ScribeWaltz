1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,750
Let's start this video by
throwing a mouse, a dog,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,450
and an elephant from a
skyscraper onto something soft.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's say a stack of mattresses,
the mouse lands,

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,410
and it's done for a moment before it
shakes itself off and walked away.

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,720
Pretty annoyed because that's
a very rude thing to do.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,010
The dog breaks sort of its bones
and dies in an unspectacular away,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,690
and the elephant explodes into a red
bubble of bones and insights and has no

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,870
chance to be annoyed.
Why does the mouse survive?

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,100
But the elephant and dog don't?
The answer is size.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,420
Size is the most underappreciated
regulator of living things.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,000
Size determines everything about
our biology, how we are built,

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,080
how we experience the world,
how we live and die.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,850
It does so because the physical laws are
different for different sized animals.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
Life spans seven orders of magnitude from
invisible bacteria to Mites and mice,

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,620
dogs, humans, elephants and blue whales.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,120
Every size lives in its own unique
universal right next to each other,

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,780
each with its own rules,
upsides and downsides.

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,900
We'll explore these different
worlds in a series of videos.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,420
Let's get back to the initial question.
Why did our mouse, it survived the fall

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,680
because of how scaling
size changes everything.

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,810
The principle that we'll meet over and
over again, very small things for example,

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,410
are practically immune to fording from
great heights because the smaller you are,

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,660
the less you care about
the effect of gravity.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,310
Imagine a theoretical spherical
animal the size of a marble.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,890
It has three features.
It's length,

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,360
it's surface area which is covered in
skin and it's volume or or the stuff

27
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,660
inside it like organs,
muscles, hopes and dreams.

28
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,220
If we make it 10 times longer,
say the size of a basketball,

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,100
the rest of it's features
don't just grow 10 times,

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,460
its skin will grow 100 times and it's
insights or its volume grows by 1000

31
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,054
times.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,740
The volume determines the weight or
more accurately mass of the animal.

33
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,660
The more mass you have,

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,140
the higher your kinetic energy before
you hit the ground and the stronger the

35
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:15,030
impact shock, the more surface area in
relation to your volume or mass you have,

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,260
the more the impact gets distributors
and softened and also the more air

37
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,610
resistance will slow you down.

38
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,800
And elephant is so big that
it has extremely little
surface area in ratio to its

39
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,360
volume, so a lot of kinetic energy gets
distributed over a small space and the ad

40
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,770
doesn't slow it down much at all.

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,300
That's why it's completely destroyed in
an impressive explosion of Goo when it

42
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,134
hits the ground.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,420
The other extreme in insects have a huge
surface area in relation to their tiny

44
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:42,900
mask,

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,800
so you can literally throw an ad from an
Arab pain and it will not be seriously

46
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,370
harmed, but while falling is
irrelevant in the small world,

47
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,530
there are other forces
that are harmless for us,

48
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,850
but extremely dangerous for
small banks like surface tension,

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,520
which turns water into eight potentially
deadly substance for insects.

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,720
How does it work?
Water has the tendency to stick to itself.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,830
It's molecules are attracted to each
other through a force called cohesion,

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,400
which creates a tension on its surface
that you can imagine it as a sort of

53
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,230
invisible skin. For us, this skin is
so weak that we don't even notice it.

54
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:22,231
Normally if you get wet about 800 grams
of water or about 1% of your body weight

55
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,010
sticks to you, a wet mouth has about
three grams of water sticking to it,

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,380
which is more than 10% of its body weight.

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,910
Imagine having eight full water bottle
sticking to you when you leave the shower,

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,320
but for an insect, the force of
water surface tension is so strong.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,930
The getting wet is a
question of life and death.

60
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,920
If we were to shrink you to the
size of an ant and you touch water,

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,970
it will be like you were reaching into
glue. It would quickly and go, phew,

62
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,270
it's surface tension too hard
for you to break and you drown.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,040
So insects evolve to be water repellent.
For one,

64
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,850
their exoskeleton is covered with a
thin layer of wax, just like a car.

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,230
This makes their surface at least partly
water repellent because it can't stick

66
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,064
to it very well.

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,780
Many insects are also covered with
tiny hairs that serves as a barrier.

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,310
They vastly increase their surface area
and prevent the droplets from touching

69
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,260
that exoskeleton and make it easier
to get rid of droplets to make use of

70
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,730
surface tension,
evolution,

71
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,880
cracked and nanotechnology
billions of years before us.

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Some insects have evolved a
surface covered by a short
and extremely dense coat

73
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,120
of water repelling hair.

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,700
Some have more than a million has passed
square millimeter when the insect dives

75
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,210
under water as stays inside there
for and forms a coat of air,

76
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,440
water content and because there has a
too tiny to break its surface tension,

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,700
but it gets even better as the
oxygen of the Arab oil runs out,

78
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,720
new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from
the water around it while the carbon

79
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:57,721
dioxide diffuses outwards into the
water and so the insect carries its own

80
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,480
outside lung around and can basically
breathe underwater thanks to surface

81
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,950
tension. This is the same principle that
enables pawn skaters to walk on water.

82
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,784
By the way,

83
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,940
tiny anti water has the smaller you get
the where do the environment becomes at

84
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,700
some point even app becomes
more and more solid.

85
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,680
Let's now zoom down to the
smallest insects known about
half the size of a grain

86
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,090
of salt, only 0.15 millimeters
long. The ferry fly,

87
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,470
they live in a world even weirder
than other insects. For them,

88
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,090
air itself is length, thin Jello, a syrup
like mass surrounding them at all times.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,110
Movement through it is not
easy flying on this level.

90
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,580
It's not like attic and gliding.

91
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,860
They have to kind of grab and hold onto
it so their wings look like big hairy

92
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,900
arms rather than proper insect wings.

93
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,760
They literally swim through the APP
like a tiny gross alien through Sarah,

94
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,410
things only become stranger from here on.
As we explore more,

95
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,040
universities have different sizes.

96
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,220
The physical rules are so
different for each size.

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,050
That evolution had to engineer around
them over and over as life grew in size in

98
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:10,520
the last billion years. So why are
there no ants? The science of horses?

99
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,600
Why no elephants the size of Amoeba?
Why?

100
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,150
We'll discuss this in the next part.
We have a monthly newsletter.
