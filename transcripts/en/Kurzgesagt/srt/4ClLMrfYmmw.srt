and we're trying to make this a regular

21
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:12,220
thing. Thanks a lot to everyone who
loves the idea of a new history.

00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,120
We couldn't do any of this without this
group of likeminded humans around the

23
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,954
world.
