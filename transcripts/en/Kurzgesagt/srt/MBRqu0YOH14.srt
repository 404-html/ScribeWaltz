1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,020
Human existence is scary and confusing.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,670
A few hundred thousand years ago,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,760
we became conscious and found
ourselves in a strange place.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
It was filled with other beings. We
could eat salmon, some could eat us.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,840
There was liquid stuff we could drink,
things we could use to make more things.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
The daytime sky at a tiny yellow
ball that warmed our skin.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
The night's sky was filled
with beautiful lights.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,400
This place was obviously made for us.
Something was watching over us.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,080
We were home. This made everything
much less scary and confusing,

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,520
but the older we got, the more we
learned about the world and ourselves.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,030
We learned that the twinkling lights
are not shining beautifully for us.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,043
They just are.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,190
We learned that we're not at the center
of what we now call the universe and

14
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,410
that it is much,
much older than we thought.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,640
We learned that we're made of many
little depth things which make our bigger

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,420
things that are not dead for some reason
and the we're just another temporary

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:00,360
stage in a history going
back over a billion years.

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,740
We learned in all the,

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,280
we live in a moist smack of Das to
moving around a medium size star.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,940
It acquired region of one
arm of an average galaxy,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,080
which is part of a galaxy group that we
will never leave and this group is only

22
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:17,700
one of thousands that together make
up a galaxy supercluster but even our

23
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,970
supercluster is only one in the
thousands that make up what we call the

24
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,440
observable universe. The universe
might be a million times bigger,

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,670
but we will never know.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,220
We could throw words around like 200
billion galaxies or trillions of stars or

27
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,190
bazillions of peanuts,
but all of these numbers mean nothing.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,870
Our brains can't comprehend these
concepts. The Universe is too big.

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,280
There is too much of x,

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,240
but size is not the most troubling
concept we have to deal with.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,870
It's time or more
precisely the time we have.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,810
If you're lucky enough to live to 100
you have 5,200 weeks at your disposal.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,460
If you're 25 now that you
have 3,900 weeks left,

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,040
if you're going to die at 70
then there are 2,340 weeks left.

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,460
A lot of time,
but also not really.

36
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,650
And then what your biological
processes will break down.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,710
And the dynamic pattern that is,
you will stop being dynamic.

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,350
It will dissolve until there is no,

39
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:23,790
you left some belief that there is a
part of us we can't see or measure,

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,770
but we have no way to find out.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,060
So this life might be yet and
we might end up dead forever.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,730
This is less scary than it sounds though.

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,590
If you don't remember the 13.7 5 billion
years that went by before you existed

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,370
than the trillions and trillions and
trillions of years that come after,

45
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,320
we'll pass in no time. Once you're
gone, close your eyes count to one.

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,210
That's how long forever feels.
And as far as we know,

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,350
in the end the universe itself will
die and nothing will ever change again.

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,370
Our videos induced existential dread
in many people and the last few minutes

49
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,830
probably haven't helped.
So for once,

50
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,520
we want to offer a different way of
looking at these sex and unscientific

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,210
subjective point of view. The philosophy
of course cause act if you want,

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,250
please take it with a grain of salt.

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,890
We don't know any more about
human existence than you do.

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,090
We count a existential dread
with optimistic Neil Islam.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,050
What do we mean by that?
Well, to summarize,

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,730
it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion
trillion stars have been made for us.

57
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,690
In a way it feels like the cruelest
joke in existence has been played on us.

58
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,850
We became self aware only to realize
this story is not about us. One,

59
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:41,290
it is great to know about electrons and
the powerhouse of the cell doesn't do a

60
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,170
lot to make this less depressing.
Okay,

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,190
but so what you and you get one
shot at life which is scary,

62
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,210
but it also sets you free.
If the universe ends in heat death,

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,180
every humiliation you suffer
in your life will be forgotten.

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,240
Every mistake you made
will not matter in the end.

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,640
Every bad thing you did will be voided.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,830
If our life is all we get to experience,
then it's the only thing that matters.

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,410
If the universe has no principles,

68
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,110
the only principals relevant
to the ones we decide on.

69
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,610
If the universe has no purpose, then
we get to dictate what its purpose is.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,040
Humans will most certainly ceased to
exist at some point, but before we do,

71
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,130
we get to explore ourselves
and the world around us.

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,380
We get to experience feelings. We get
to experience food, books, sunrises,

73
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,490
and being with each other.

74
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,780
The fact that we're even able to think
about these things is already kind of

75
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:39,070
incredible. It's easy to think of
ourselves as separated from everything,

76
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,360
but this is not true.

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,490
We are as much the universe as a neutron
star or a black hole or a nebula.

78
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,860
Even better actually we are.

79
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,250
It's thinking and feeling the
sensory organs or the universe.

80
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,030
We are truly free in a
universe sized playground,

81
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,380
so we might as well aim to be happy
and to build some kind of utopia in the

82
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,150
stars. It's not as if we
found out everything there is
to know. We don't know why.

83
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,900
The rules of the universe are as they are,
how life came into existence,

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,070
what life is.

85
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,080
We have no idea what consciousness is
or if we are alone in the universe,

86
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,360
but we can try to find some answers.
There are billions of stars to visit,

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,710
diseases to cure people, to help,
happy feelings, to be experienced,

88
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,310
and video games to finish.
There is so much to do.

89
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,140
So wrapping up,

90
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,350
you've probably used up a good
chunk of the time available to you.

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,720
If this is our one shot at life,

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,380
there is no reason not to have
fun and live as happy as possible.

93
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,390
Bonus points if you make the life of
other people better, more bonus points.

94
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,130
If you help build a galactic human empire,
do the things that make you feel good.

95
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,920
You get to decide whatever
this means for you.
