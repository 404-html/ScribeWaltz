00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
Recently,
there's been a lot of talk about measles.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
What does measles actually do and shit,

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,850
you vaccinate against it
or is this just hysteria?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,940
Measles is a virus,
a Holler of proteins,

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,980
RNA plus some more proteins
for reproduction. It
cannot reproduce by itself.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,520
It needs a host cell. To do
so. To understand measles,

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,890
we have to understand the immune system.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,460
You might already have seen the visual
system we developed to help here.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,930
Now let's focus on the parts of the
immune system relevant to me. Source,

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,070
the measles virus enters humans
through the nose, mouth, or eyes.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,410
The measles infection starts in the lungs.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,550
Measles is especially good at infecting
the body's first line of defense.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,900
Macrophages, powerful for God. Cells
that protect the lungs from intruders.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,030
They enter a cell and take it over.

15
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,740
The virus reprograms the cell and
transforms it into a dangerous virus

16
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:03,130
production center.
Once a cell is filled with viruses,

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,850
they leave the crippled cell
and begin the cycle over again.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,870
But the immune system has powerful
weapons against virus infections,

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,430
natural killer cells.

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,110
These cells basically patrol the body
and check other cells for infections.

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,430
If they find an infected cell,
they order it to commit suicide.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,760
This is sill effective that
for the first 10 days or so,

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,700
you will not even notice the
you're infected with measles.

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,840
And now the reason why
measles is so powerful.

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,820
After a period of fighting and dying,

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,900
macrophages alert the brain of the
immune system, the dendritic cells,

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,680
the job of the dendritic cells is
to collect samples of intruders,

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,000
traveled to the lymph nodes,

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,380
and then activate the heavy weapons that
eradicate the infection very fast in a

30
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:52,150
team effort. But the measles
virus uses a dreadful tactic.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,070
It infects the dendritic cells and uses
them as a Trojan horse to enter deeper

32
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:57,904
into the body.

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,500
The infected cells travel to the next
lymph node to alert other immune cells.

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,700
Once it arrives,

35
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,890
the measles virus spreads around the
virgin t and B cells and infects the hub.

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,160
It attacks the very system
that evolve to fight it.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,470
Now things happen very fast.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,220
The lymph system spreads the virus
everywhere and it enters the bloodstream

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,090
infecting cells while traveling.
Measles infects organs like the spleen,

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,090
the liver, the intestines, and
most importantly the lungs.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,140
The symptoms range from a very high
fever, headache, sickness, bronchitis,

42
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,370
and of course a rash in the lungs.
The immune system was doing pretty okay,

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,690
but now millions of viruses attack a
second time and killed countless cells

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,300
wiping out the defense systems.
In this phase,

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,220
you start coughing out
millions of measles viruses.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560
Measles is so contagious at this stage
that if you meet someone who isn't

47
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:48,394
vaccinated,

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,170
there's about a 90% chance you'll infect
them without the protective army in the

49
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:53,650
lungs,

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,760
other bacteria or viruses that would
usually not stand a chance can now enter

51
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:02,200
the lungs and developing
harmful paralleled infections
that can cause pneumonia.

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,420
The most common way to die from measles,

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,750
your body's immune system
is now seriously wounded.

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,990
Various protective systems
are hurt and disrupted.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,070
The virus spreads everywhere in
affecting the skin all over the body.

56
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,460
The typical measles rash
now becomes visible and in
some cases the measles virus

57
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,830
reaches the brain and
causes a brain infection.

58
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,990
If it does so the chances of dying
are between 20 to 40% and there may be

59
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,130
longterm damage,

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,390
but your body is far from giving up
at their stage and it fights back

61
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
aggressively.

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,120
Some dendritic cells that survive long
enough to activate the antivirus forces

63
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,560
of the body plasma cells in the lymph
nodes start producing billions of

64
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,394
antibodies,

65
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,900
tiny proteins that mark can affect
itself for destruction or clump the virus

66
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,734
together.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,420
Killer t cells flood the body and kill
infected cells left and right after two

68
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,170
to three weeks,

69
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,500
the body usually gets the upper
hand and overwhelmed the infection,

70
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,550
but the [inaudible] system has now
seriously weakened and may take weeks or

71
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,270
months to recover, leaving the
body vulnerable to other diseases.

72
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,510
But if you make it,
you are now immune.

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,430
The immune system remembers the
virus forever. Measles is no joke.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,540
Although 84% of all humans are
vaccinated against measles,

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,720
122,000 people died because of the
infection in 2014 some people cannot get

76
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:30,160
vaccinations by that because they're too
young because of chemotherapy or HIV or

77
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,690
because they're allergic to the vaccine.

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,020
They need the rest of us to
stop the disease for them.

79
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,010
The measles vaccination is
safe, cheap, and available.

80
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
There are no benefits from
having measles at all.

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,370
You don't strengthen your immune
system and it's not more natural.

82
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,120
Most people who don't vaccinate only
want the best for their children,

83
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,280
which is honorable,
but if you ask yourself,

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,240
am I putting the life of my child and
other children at risk by not vaccinating

85
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,590
against measles? The sad
answer is yes. Yes you are.

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,810
Let's not play the blame game though.

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,020
Let's work together and
eradicate this virus together.

88
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,650
We can get rid of these dreadful monsters
and consign them to their rightful

89
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,240
place.
The history books.
