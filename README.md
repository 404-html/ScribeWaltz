In absence of searchable transcripts, many interesting YouTube videos, podcasts, lectures and talks are hard to explore, quote and summarize. **AnansiPot** is an open data project regrouping over 800 YouTube video transcripts discussing social and political issues, psychology, history and scientific topics ranging from biology, mathematics to artificial intelligence : The Joe Rogan Experience, The Rubin Report, Jordan B. Peterson talks, Lex Fridman lectures and more. This project is a first step towards making great content more available and inspiring speakers, storytellers, interviewers and scientists better heard.

## Why this name, AnansiPot ? 
<img align="left" width="125,36px" height="190px"  src="img/potOfWisdom.jpg">  Anansi is a West African folktale character. He often takes the shape of a spider and is considered to be the spirit of all knowledge of stories.

From https://mythology.net : 
> "Anansi is the King of Stories, the trickster, the joke maker, and the teacher of those who would follow these traditions. Anansi can be summoned by those with a gift for stories, either to listen to a well-told tale or to help someone who is talented but just beginning to become a master storyteller. [..] He had a pot containing all the wisdom of the world, and every day Anansi would look in the pot and learn some new and wondrous thing."
